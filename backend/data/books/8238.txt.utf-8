Book 11 1 Kings
001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he got no heat.
001:002 Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin:  and let her stand before
        the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom,
        that my lord the king may keep warm.
001:003 So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all
        the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite,
        and brought her to the king.
001:004 The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king,
        and ministered to him; but the king didn't know her intimately.
001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
        I will be king:  and he prepared him chariots and horsemen,
        and fifty men to run before him.
001:006 His father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why have you done so? and he was also a very goodly man;
        and he was born after Absalom.
001:007 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
        the priest:  and they following Adonijah helped him.
001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty
        men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
001:009 Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all
        his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah,
        the king's servants:
001:010 but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men,
        and Solomon his brother, he didn't call.
001:011 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
        Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns,
        and David our lord doesn't know it?
001:012 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you
        may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
001:013 Go and get you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you,
        my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon
        your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
        why then does Adonijah reign?
001:014 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will
        come in after you, and confirm your words.
001:015 Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber:  and the king
        was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering
        to the king.
001:016 Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.  The king said,
        What would you?
001:017 She said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God
        to your handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
001:018 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
        don't know it:
001:019 and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
        and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest,
        and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called
        Solomon your servant.
001:020 You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,
        that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him.
001:021 Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall
        be counted offenders.
001:022 Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet came in.
001:023 They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet.
        When he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.
001:024 Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
001:025 For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings
        and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons,
        and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest;
        and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
        [Long] live king Adonijah.
001:026 But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest,
        and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.
001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown
        to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord
        the king after him?
001:028 Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba.
        She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
001:029 The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed
        my soul out of all adversity,
001:030 most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
        and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most certainly
        so will I do this day.
001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance
        to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.
001:032 King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  They came
        before the king.
001:033 The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
        and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring
        him down to Gihon:
001:034 and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say,
        [Long] live king Solomon.
001:035 Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit
        on my throne; for he shall be king in my place; and I have
        appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
001:036 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
        and said, Amen:  Yahweh, the God of my lord the king,
        say so [too].
001:037 As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be
        he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne
        of my lord king David.
001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites,
        went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule,
        and brought him to Gihon.
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
001:044 and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused
        him to ride on the king's mule;
001:045 and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing,
        so that the city rang again.  This is the noise that
        you have heard.
001:046 Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
001:047 Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord
        king David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better
        than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne:
        and the king bowed himself on the bed.
001:048 Also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes
        even seeing it.
001:049 All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went
        every man his way.
001:050 Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
001:051 It was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon;
        for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar,
        saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not
        kill his servant with the sword.
001:052 Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall
        not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found
        in him, he shall die.
001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
        He came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said
        to him, Go to your house.
002:001 Now the days of David drew near that he should die;
        and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
002:002 I am going the way of all the earth:  be you strong therefore,
        and show yourself a man;
002:003 and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances,
        and his testimonies, according to that which is written
        in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do,
        and wherever you turn yourself.
002:004 That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me,
        saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
        there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
002:005 Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
        even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel,
        to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether,
        whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put
        the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.
002:006 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his gray
        head go down to Sheol in peace.
002:007 But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they
        came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
002:008 Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I
        went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan,
        and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you
        to death with the sword.
002:009 Now therefore don't hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man;
        and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall
        bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.
002:010 David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
002:011 The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty-three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.
002:012 Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
        was established greatly.
002:013 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba
        the mother of Solomon.  She said, Come you peaceably?
        He said, Peaceably.
002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to tell you.
        She said, Say on.
002:015 He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all
        Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign:
        however the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's;
        for it was his from Yahweh.
002:016 Now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me.  She said
        to him, Say on.
002:017 He said, "Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell
        you 'no'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife."
002:018 Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
002:019 Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him
        for Adonijah.  The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself
        to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be
        set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
002:020 Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me.
        The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.
002:021 She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        your brother as wife.
002:022 King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag
        the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also;
        for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
        the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
002:023 Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against
        his own life.
002:024 Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made
        me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put
        to death this day.
002:025 King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell
        on him, so that he died.
002:026 To Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth,
        to your own fields; for you are worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bear
        the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because
        you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh,
        that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
002:028 The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he didn't turn after Absalom.  Joab fled to the Tent
        of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
002:029 It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh,
        and behold, he is by the altar.  Then Solomon sent Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
002:030 Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says
        the king, Come forth.  He said, No; but I will die here.
        Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,
        and thus he answered me.
002:031 The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him,
        and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab
        shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.
002:032 Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell
        on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed
        them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it,
        [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel,
        and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
002:033 So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on
        the head of his seed forever:  but to David, and to his seed,
        and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace
        for ever from Yahweh.
002:034 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him,
        and killed him; and he was buried in his own house
        in the wilderness.
002:035 The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army;
        and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
002:036 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him,
        Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there,
        and don't go forth from there any where.
002:037 For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron,
        know you for certain that you shall surely die:
        your blood shall be on your own head.
002:038 Shimei said to the king, The saying is good:
        as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.
        Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
002:039 It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants
        of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath.
        They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.
002:040 Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish,
        to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.
002:041 It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
        and was come again.
002:042 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I
        adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain,
        that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where,
        you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I
        have heard is good.
002:043 Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment
        that I have charged you with?
002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness
        which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father:
        therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.
002:045 But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before Yahweh forever.
002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
        and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died.
        The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
003:001 Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house
        of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
003:002 Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there
        was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.
003:003 Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father:
        only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
003:004 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place:  a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer on that altar.
003:005 In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night;
        and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
003:006 Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father
        great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth,
        and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you;
        and you have kept for him this great loving kindness,
        that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it
        is this day.
003:007 Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead
        of David my father:  and I am but a little child; I don't
        know how to go out or come in.
003:008 Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen,
        a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.
003:009 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge
        your people, that I may discern between good and evil;
        for who is able to judge this your great people?
003:010 The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
003:011 God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have
        not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches
        for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies,
        but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;
003:012 behold, I have done according to your word:  behold, I have
        given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there
        has been none like you before you, neither after you shall
        any arise like you.
003:013 I have also given you that which you have not asked,
        both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like you, all your days.
003:014 If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments,
        as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
003:015 Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream:  and he came
        to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings,
        and made a feast to all his servants.
003:016 Then there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king,
        and stood before him.
003:017 The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
        and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
003:018 It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this
        woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no
        stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
003:019 This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.
003:020 She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom,
        and laid her dead child in my bosom.
003:021 When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead;
        but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was
        not my son, whom I bore.
003:022 The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead
        is your son.  This said, No; but the dead is your son,
        and the living is my son.  Thus they spoke before the king.
003:023 Then said the king, The one says, This is my son who lives,
        and your son is the dead:  and the other says, No; but your
        son is the dead, and my son is the living.
003:024 The king said, Get me a sword.  They brought a sword
        before the king.
003:025 The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
        to the one, and half to the other.
003:026 Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king,
        for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no way kill it.
        But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.
003:027 Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no
        way kill it:  she is the mother of it.
003:028 All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
        and they feared the king:  for they saw that the wisdom of God
        was in him, to do justice.
004:001 King Solomon was king over all Israel.
004:002 These were the princes whom he had:  Azariah the son
        of Zadok, the priest;
004:003 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the
        son of Ahilud, the recorder;
004:004 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok
        and Abiathar were priests;
004:005 and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was chief minister, [and] the king's friend;
004:006 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son
        of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.
004:007 Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided
        food for the king and his household:  each man had to make
        provision for a month in the year.
004:008 These are their names:  Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
004:009 Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh,
        and Elon Beth Hanan;
004:010 Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all
        the land of Hepher);
004:011 Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath
        the daughter of Solomon as wife);
004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all
        Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel,
        from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
004:013 Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him [pertained] the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to
        him [pertained] the region of Argob, which is in Bashan,
        sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
004:015 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter
        of Solomon as wife);
004:016 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
004:018 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
004:019 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country
        of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan;
        and [he was] the only officer who was in the land.
004:020 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea
        in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
004:021 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to
        the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt:
        they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days
        of his life.
004:022 Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour,
        and sixty measures of meal,
004:023 ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and one
        hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks,
        and fattened fowl.
004:024 For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River,
        from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side
        the River:  and he had peace on all sides round about him.
004:025 Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        all the days of Solomon.
004:026 Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen.
004:027 Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all
        who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month;
        they let nothing be lacking.
004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought
        they to the place where [the officers] were, every man
        according to his charge.
004:029 God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and very great understanding, even as the sand that is
        on the seashore.
004:030 Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite,
        and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
        and his fame was in all the nations round about.
004:032 He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were
        one thousand five.
004:033 He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to
        the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals,
        and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
004:034 There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
005:001 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard
        that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:
        for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
005:002 Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
005:003 You know how that David my father could not build a house
        for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about
        him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles
        of his feet.
005:004 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side;
        there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
005:005 Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh
        my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, Your son,
        whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build
        the house for my name.
005:006 Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
        and my servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you
        hire for your servants according to all that you shall say:
        for you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut
        timber like the Sidonians.
005:007 It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Yahweh this day,
        who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
005:008 Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard [the message]
        which you have sent to me:  I will do all your desire concerning
        timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea;
        and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you
        shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there,
        and you shall receive them; and you shall accomplish my desire,
        in giving food for my household.
005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir
        according to all his desire.
005:011 Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil:
        thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
005:012 Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there
        was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made
        a league together.
005:013 King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.
005:014 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses;
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home;
        and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.
005:015 Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty
        thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
005:016 besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work,
        three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people
        who labored in the work.
005:017 The king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones,
        to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.
005:018 Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites
        did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones
        to build the house.
006:001 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after
        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
        in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel,
        in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began
        to build the house of Yahweh.
006:002 The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, the length of it
        was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty [cubits],
        and the height of it thirty cubits.
006:003 The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
        the length of it, according to the breadth of the house;
        [and] ten cubits was the breadth of it before the house.
006:004 For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.
006:005 Against the wall of the house he built stories round about,
        against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple
        and of the oracle; and he made side chambers round about.
006:006 The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad;
        for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house
        round about, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls
        of the house.
006:007 The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
        ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor
        any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
006:008 The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side
        of the house:  and they went up by winding stairs into
        the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.
006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house
        with beams and planks of cedar.
006:010 He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high:
        and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
006:011 The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,
006:012 Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk
        in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word
        with you, which I spoke to David your father.
006:013 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
        my people Israel.
006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
006:015 He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar:
        from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling,
        he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered
        the floor of the house with boards of fir.
006:016 He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house
        with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of
        the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle,
        even for the most holy place.
006:017 The house, that is, the temple before [the oracle],
        was forty cubits [long].
006:018 There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and
        open flowers:  all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
006:019 He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within,
        to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
006:020 Within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in
        the height of it; and he overlaid it with pure gold:
        and he covered the altar with cedar.
006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold:
        and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle;
        and he overlaid it with gold.
006:022 The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house
        was finished:  also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle
        he overlaid with gold.
006:023 In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood,
        each ten cubits high.
006:024 Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
        the other wing of the cherub:  from the uttermost part of the one
        wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
006:025 The other cherub was ten cubits:  both the cherubim were of one
        measure and one form.
006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it
        of the other cherub.
006:027 He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings
        of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.
006:028 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
006:029 He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
        figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers,
        inside and outside.
006:030 The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
006:031 For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood:
        the lintel [and] door posts were a fifth part [of the wall].
006:032 So [he made] two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them
        carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
        them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim,
        and on the palm trees.
006:033 So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts
        of olive wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];
006:034 and two doors of fir wood:  the two leaves of the one door
        were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
006:035 He carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers;
        and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.
006:036 He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams.
006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid,
        in the month Ziv.
006:038 In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
        was the house finished throughout all the parts of it,
        and according to all the fashion of it.  So was he seven
        years in building it.
007:001 Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
        all his house.
007:002 For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it
        was one hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits,
        and the height of it thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars,
        with cedar beams on the pillars.
007:003 It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams,
        that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
007:004 There were beams in three rows, and window was over against
        window in three ranks.
007:005 All the doors and posts were made square with beams:
        and window was over against window in three ranks.
007:006 He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits,
        and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them;
        and pillars and a threshold before them.
007:007 He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge,
        even the porch of judgment:  and it was covered with cedar
        from floor to floor.
007:008 His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch,
        was of the like work.  He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter
        (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.
007:009 All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone,
        according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside,
        even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside
        to the great court.
007:010 The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
007:011 Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure,
        and cedar wood.
007:012 The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house
        of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.
007:013 King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
007:014 He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with
        wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass.
        He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.
007:015 For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits
        high apiece:  and a line of twelve cubits compassed either
        of them about.
007:016 He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of
        the pillars:  the height of the one capital was five cubits,
        and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
007:017 There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work,
        for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
        seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
007:018 So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on
        the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top
        of the pillars:  and so did he for the other capital.
007:019 The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch
        were of lily work, four cubits.
007:020 There were capitals above also on the two pillars,
        close by the belly which was beside the network:
        and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about
        on the other capital.
007:021 He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple:
        and he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin;
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
007:022 On the top of the pillars was lily work:  so was the work
        of the pillars finished.
007:023 He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits;
        and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
007:024 Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did
        compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about:
        the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
007:025 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
        and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
        the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was
        set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
007:026 It was a handbreadth thick:  and the brim of it was worked
        like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily:
        it held two thousand baths.
007:027 He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length
        of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits
        the height of it.
007:028 The work of the bases was on this manner:  they had panels;
        and there were panels between the ledges;
007:029 and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen,
        and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above;
        and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
007:030 Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass;
        and the four feet of it had supports:  beneath the basin
        were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
007:031 The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit:
        and the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal,
        a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were engravings,
        and their panels were foursquare, not round.
007:032 The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles
        of the wheels were in the base:  and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.
007:033 The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
        their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves,
        were all molten.
007:034 There were four supports at the four corners of each base:
        the supports of it were of the base itself.
007:035 In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high;
        and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels
        of it were of the same.
007:036 On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it,
        he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
        the space of each, with wreaths round about.
007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases:  all of them had
        one casting, one measure, and one form.
007:038 He made ten basins of brass:  one basin contained forty baths;
        and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten
        bases one basin.
007:039 He set the bases, five on the right side of the house,
        and five on the left side of the house:  and he set the sea
        on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
007:040 Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins.
        So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked
        for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:
007:041 the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on
        the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
007:042 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
        two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
007:043 and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;
007:044 and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
007:045 and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins:
        even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon,
        in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.
007:046 In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
007:047 Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were
        exceeding many:  the weight of the brass could not be found out.
007:048 Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh:
        the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show
        bread was, of gold;
007:049 and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left,
        before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps,
        and the tongs, of gold;
007:050 and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons,
        and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for
        the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for
        the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.
007:051 Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house
        of Yahweh was finished.  Solomon brought in the things
        which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries
        of the house of Yahweh.
008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the
        children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David,
        which is Zion.
008:002 All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at
        the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
008:003 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
008:004 They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting,
        and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did
        the priests and the Levites bring up.
008:005 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled
        to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen,
        that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
008:006 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
        its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,
        even under the wings of the cherubim.
008:007 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles
        of it above.
008:008 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from
        the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside:
        and there they are to this day.
008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the
        land of Egypt.
008:010 It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
        that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,
008:011 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.
008:012 Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
        in the thick darkness.
008:013 I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you
        to dwell in forever.
008:014 The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly
        of Israel:  and all the assembly of Israel stood.
008:015 He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
        with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,
008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out
        of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel
        to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.
008:017 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
        for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:018 But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
        heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it
        was in your heart:
008:019 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
        shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house
        for my name.
008:020 Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
        in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel,
        as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:021 There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant
        of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought
        them out of the land of Egypt.
008:022 Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
        the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
008:023 and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
        in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant
        and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you
        with all their heart;
008:024 who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
        did promise him:  yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have
        fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
008:025 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
        David my father that which you have promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne
        of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way,
        to walk before me as you have walked before me.
008:026 Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified,
        which you spoke to your servant David my father.
008:027 But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you;
        how much less this house that I have built!
008:028 Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for
        his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to
        the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
008:029 that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall
        be there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
        pray toward this place.
008:030 Listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your
        people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place:
        yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when
        you hear, forgive.
008:031 If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him
        to cause him to swear, and he come [and] swear before your
        altar in this house;
008:032 then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head,
        and justifying the righteous, to give him according
        to his righteousness.
008:033 When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you,
        and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you
        in this house:
008:034 then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
        and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.
008:035 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place,
        and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you
        do afflict them:
008:036 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
        and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way
        in which they should walk; and send rain on your land,
        which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        if there is blight [or] mildew, locust [or] caterpillar;
        if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities;
        whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;
008:038 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
        [or] by all your people Israel, who shall know every man
        the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands
        toward this house:
008:039 then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive,
        and do, and render to every man according to all his ways,
        whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts
        of all the children of men;)
008:040 that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land
        which you gave to our fathers.
008:041 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
        when he shall come out of a far country for your name's sake
008:042 (for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand,
        and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray
        toward this house;
008:043 hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all
        that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples
        of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as does your
        people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I
        have built is called by my name.
008:044 If your people go out to battle against their enemy,
        by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh
        toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house
        which I have built for your name;
008:045 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.
008:046 If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
        and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
        so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy,
        far off or near;
008:047 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
        are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication
        to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
008:048 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive,
        and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers,
        the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have
        built for your name:
008:049 then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven,
        your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;
008:050 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their
        transgressions in which they have transgressed against you;
        and give them compassion before those who carried them captive,
        that they may have compassion on them
008:051 (for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought
        forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
008:052 that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant,
        and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen
        to them whenever they cry to you.
008:053 For you did separate them from among all the peoples of the earth,
        to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant,
        when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.
008:054 It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
        this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before
        the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands
        spread forth toward heaven.
008:055 He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a
        loud voice, saying,
008:056 Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel,
        according to all that he promised:  there has not failed
        one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        Moses his servant.
008:057 Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:
        let him not leave us, nor forsake us;
008:058 that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways,
        and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances,
        which he commanded our fathers.
008:059 Let these my words, with which I have made supplication
        before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause
        of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
008:060 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God;
        there is none else.
008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God,
        to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments,
        as at this day.
008:062 The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
008:063 Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,
        which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen,
        and one hundred twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all
        the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.
008:064 The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy
        that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered
        the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat
        of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was
        before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering,
        and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
008:065 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him,
        a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook
        of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days,
        even fourteen days.
008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed
        the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant,
        and to Israel his people.
009:001 It happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house
        of Yahweh, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire
        which he was pleased to do,
009:002 that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared to him at Gibeon.
009:003 Yahweh said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication,
        that you have made before me:  I have made this house holy,
        which you have built, to put my name there forever;
        and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
009:004 As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according
        to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes
        and my ordinances;
009:005 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever,
        according as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall
        not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
009:006 But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children,
        and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
        have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods,
        and worship them;
009:007 then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
        and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast
        out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword
        among all peoples.
009:008 Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes
        by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say,
        Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
009:009 and they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God,
        who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them:
        therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.
009:010 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
        built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king's house
009:011 (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all
        his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities
        in the land of Galilee.
009:012 Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
        given him; and they didn't please him.
009:013 He said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?
        He called them the land of Cabul to this day.
009:014 Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.
009:015 This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised,
        to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo,
        and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
009:016 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
        it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city,
        and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
009:017 Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,
009:018 and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
009:019 and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities
        for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that
        which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem,
        and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
009:020 As for all the people who were left of the Amorites,
        the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
        who were not of the children of Israel;
009:021 their children who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy,
        of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants to this day.
009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants;
        but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes,
        and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
009:023 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work,
        five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored
        in the work.
009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David
        to her house which [Solomon] had built for her:
        then did he build Millo.
009:025 Three times a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh,
        burning incense therewith, [on the altar] that was before Yahweh.
        So he finished the house.
009:026 King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        in the land of Edom.
009:027 Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge
        of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
009:028 They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred
        and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
010:001 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
        the name of Yahweh, she came to prove him with hard questions.
010:002 She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones;
        and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all
        that was in her heart.
010:003 Solomon told her all her questions:  there was not anything
        hidden from the king which he didn't tell her.
010:004 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,
010:005 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing,
        and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up
        to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.
010:006 She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
        own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
010:007 However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my
        eyes had seen it:  and behold, the half was not told me;
        your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
010:008 Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand
        continually before you, [and] who hear your wisdom.
010:009 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
        on the throne of Israel:  because Yahweh loved Israel forever,
        therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.
010:010 She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
        there came no more such abundance of spices as these which
        the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
010:011 The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
        from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.
010:012 The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh,
        and for the king's house, harps also and stringed instruments
        for the singers:  there came no such almug trees, nor were seen,
        to this day.
010:013 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty.  So she turned, and went to her own land,
        she and her servants.
010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
        hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
010:015 besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic
        of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people,
        and of the governors of the country.
010:016 King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
        six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.
010:017 [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas
        of gold went to one shield:  and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.
010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the finest gold.
010:019 There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was
        round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place
        of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
010:020 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
        the six steps:  there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
010:021 All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
        of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
        none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.
010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram:
        once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold,
        and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches
        and in wisdom.
010:024 All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom,
        which God had put in his heart.
010:025 They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
        of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules,
        a rate year by year.
010:026 Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen:
        and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve
        thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities,
        and with the king at Jerusalem.
010:027 The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
        and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are
        in the lowland, for abundance.
010:028 The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt;
        and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove
        at a price.
010:029 A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty;
        and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings
        of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
011:001 Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter
        of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians,
        and Hittites;
011:002 of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children
        of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they
        come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart
        after their gods:  Solomon joined to these in love.
011:003 He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines;
        and his wives turned away his heart.
011:004 For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
        away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect
        with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.
011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
011:006 Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
        and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.
011:007 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination
        of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for
        Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
011:008 So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and
        sacrificed to their gods.
011:009 Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away
        from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
011:010 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
        after other gods:  but he didn't keep that which Yahweh commanded.
011:011 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you,
        and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I
        have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you,
        and will give it to your servant.
011:012 Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David
        your father's sake:  but I will tear it out of the hand
        of your son.
011:013 However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will
        give one tribe to your son, for David my servant's sake,
        and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
011:014 Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
        he was of the king's seed in Edom.
011:015 For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain
        of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck
        every male in Edom
011:016 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had
        cut off every male in Edom);
011:017 that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
        with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
011:018 They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men
        with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh
        king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food,
        and gave him land.
011:019 Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister
        of Tahpenes the queen.
011:020 The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
        weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's
        house among the sons of Pharaoh.
011:021 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
        and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said
        to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
011:022 Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me,
        that behold, you seek to go to your own country?
        He answered, Nothing:  however only let me depart.
011:023 God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada,
        who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
011:024 He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop,
        when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus,
        and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.
011:025 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.
011:026 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah,
        a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow,
        he also lifted up his hand against the king.
011:027 This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king:
        Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city
        of David his father.
011:028 The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw
        the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge
        over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
011:029 It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
        that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
        now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field.
011:030 Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore
        it in twelve pieces.
011:031 He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of
        the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you
011:032 (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake
        and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out
        of all the tribes of Israel);
011:033 because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god
        of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon;
        and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right
        in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances,
        as did David his father.
011:034 However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand;
        but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David
        my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments
        and my statutes;
011:035 but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it to you, even ten tribes.
011:036 To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
        have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I
        have chosen me to put my name there.
011:037 I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your
        soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
011:038 It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you,
        and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes,
        to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did;
        that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house,
        as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
011:039 I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.
011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
        until the death of Solomon.
011:041 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,
        and his wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the
        acts of Solomon?
011:042 The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.
011:043 Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father:  and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
012:001 Rehoboam went to Shechem:  for all Israel were come to Shechem
        to make him king.
012:002 It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it
        (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,
012:003 and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly
        of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
012:004 Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
        the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke
        which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
012:005 He said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.
        The people departed.
012:006 King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
        Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel
        give you me to return answer to this people?
012:007 They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this
        people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak
        good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.
012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
        and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him,
        who stood before him.
012:009 He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer
        to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        that your father did put on us lighter?
012:010 The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
        Thus shall you tell this people who spoke to you, saying,
        Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us;
        thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker
        than my father's waist.
012:011 Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
        I will add to your yoke:  my father chastised you with whips,
        but I will chastise you with scorpions.
012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
012:013 The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel
        of the old men which they had given him,
012:014 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke:
        my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.
012:015 So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing
        brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word,
        which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
012:016 When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we
        in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        to your tents, Israel:  now see to your own house, David.
        So Israel departed to their tents.
012:017 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
        of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject
        to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.
        King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot,
        to flee to Jerusalem.
012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
012:020 It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned,
        that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him
        king over all Israel:  there was none who followed the house
        of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
012:021 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
        of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty
        thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against
        the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon.
012:022 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
012:023 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
        and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest
        of the people, saying,
012:024 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your
        brothers the children of Israel:  return every man to his house;
        for this thing is of me.  So they listened to the word of Yahweh,
        and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.
012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,
        and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.
012:026 Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return
        to the house of David:
012:027 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house
        of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people
        turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah;
        and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold;
        and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
        see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the
        land of Egypt.
012:029 He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
012:030 This thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship]
        before the one, even to Dan.
012:031 He made houses of high places, and made priests from among
        all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
012:032 Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
        day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went
        up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves
        that he had made:  and he placed in Bethel the priests
        of the high places that he had made.
012:033 He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on
        the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month
        which he had devised of his own heart:  and he ordained
        a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar,
        to burn incense.
013:001 Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of Yahweh to Beth El:  and Jeroboam was standing by the altar
        to burn incense.
013:002 He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said,
        altar, altar, thus says Yahweh:  Behold, a son shall be born
        to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall
        he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense
        on you, and men's bones shall they burn on you.
013:003 He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which Yahweh has spoken:  Behold, the altar shall be torn,
        and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.
013:004 It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God,
        which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam
        put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
        His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not draw it back again to him.
013:005 The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
        according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of Yahweh.
013:006 The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh
        your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
        The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king's hand was
        restored him again, and became as it was before.
013:007 The king said to the man of God, Come home with me,
        and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
013:008 The man of God said to the king, If you will give me half
        your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat
        bread nor drink water in this place;
013:009 for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall
        eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way
        that you came.
013:010 So he went another way, and didn't return by the way that
        he came to Bethel.
013:011 Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons
        came and told him all the works that the man of God had done
        that day in Bethel:  the words which he had spoken to the king,
        them also they told to their father.
013:012 Their father said to them, Which way did he go?
        Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went,
        who came from Judah.
013:013 He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey.  So they saddled
        him the donkey; and he rode thereon.
013:014 He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak;
        and he said to him, Are you the man of God who came
        from Judah?  He said, I am.
013:015 Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
013:016 He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you;
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
013:017 for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no
        bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way
        that you came.
013:018 He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel
        spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring him back with
        you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.
        [But] he lied to him.
013:019 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house,
        and drank water.
013:020 It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh
        came to the prophet who brought him back;
013:021 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh
        your God commanded you,
013:022 but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place
        of which he said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water;
        your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
013:023 It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
        that he saddled for him the donkey, [to wit], for the prophet
        whom he had brought back.
013:024 When he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him:
        and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it;
        the lion also stood by the body.
013:025 Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way,
        and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it
        in the city where the old prophet lived.
013:026 When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it,
        he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh:  therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion,
        which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.
013:027 He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey.
        They saddled it.
013:028 He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey
        and the lion standing by the body:  the lion had not eaten
        the body, nor torn the donkey.
013:029 The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it
        on the donkey, and brought it back; and he came to the city
        of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
013:030 He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
        [saying], Alas, my brother!
013:031 It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons,
        saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which
        the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.
013:033 After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made
        again from among all the people priests of the high places:
        whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests
        of the high places.
013:034 This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off,
        and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.
014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
014:002 Jeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself,
        that you not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you
        to Shiloh:  behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke
        concerning me that I should be king over this people.
014:003 Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey,
        and go to him:  he will tell you what shall become of the child.
014:004 Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh,
        and came to the house of Ahijah.  Now Ahijah could not see;
        for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
014:005 Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes
        to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shall you tell her; for it will be, when she
        comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
014:006 It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
        in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam;
        why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you
        with heavy news.
014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Because I
        exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over
        my people Israel,
014:008 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you;
        and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart,
        to do that only which was right in my eyes,
014:009 but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone
        and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me
        to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
014:010 therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam,
        and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel,
        and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man
        sweeps away dung, until it be all gone.
014:011 Him who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat:
        for Yahweh has spoken it.
014:012 Arise you therefore, get you to your house:  [and] when your
        feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
014:013 All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there
        is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in the house of Jeroboam.
014:014 Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel,
        who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day:
        but what? even now.
014:015 For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water;
        and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave
        to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,
        because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger.
014:016 He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.
014:017 Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        [and] as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
014:018 All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
014:019 The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel.
014:020 The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned
        in his place.
014:021 Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was
        forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen
        out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there:
        and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
014:022 Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they
        provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.
014:023 For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree;
014:024 and there were also sodomites in the land:  they did according
        to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove
        out before the children of Israel.
014:025 It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
        king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
014:026 and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
        and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all:
        and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
014:027 King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
        and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard,
        who kept the door of the king's house.
014:028 It was so, that as often as the king went into the house
        of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into
        the guard chamber.
014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?
014:030 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
014:031 Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
        the city of David:  and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
        Abijam his son reigned in his place.
015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        began Abijam to reign over Judah.
015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's name
        was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:003 He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God,
        as the heart of David his father.
015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did Yahweh his God give
        him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him,
        and to establish Jerusalem;
015:005 because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
        and didn't turn aside from anything that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, except only in the matter
        of Uriah the Hittite.
015:006 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.
015:007 The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
015:008 Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city
        of David:  and Asa his son reigned in his place.
015:009 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa
        to reign over Judah.
015:010 Forty-one years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:011 Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did
        David his father.
015:012 He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
        the idols that his fathers had made.
015:013 Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen,
        because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah;
        and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
015:014 But the high places were not taken away:  nevertheless the heart
        of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.
015:015 He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father
        had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.
015:016 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:017 Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
        that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa
        king of Judah.
015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left
        in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures
        of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand
        of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad,
        the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria,
        who lived at Damascus, saying,
015:019 [There is] a league between me and you, between my father and
        your father:  behold, I have sent to you a present of silver
        and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel,
        that he may depart from me.
015:020 Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all
        the land of Naphtali.
015:021 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
        building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.
015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted:
        and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it,
        with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith
        Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
015:023 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might,
        and all that he did, and the cities which he built,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  But in the time of his old age he was diseased
        in his feet.
015:024 Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
        in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son
        reigned in his place.
015:025 Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
        year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
015:026 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
015:027 Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        were laying siege to Gibbethon.
015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha kill him,
        and reigned in his place.
015:029 It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house
        of Jeroboam:  he didn't leave to Jeroboam any who breathed,
        until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh,
        which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
015:030 for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which
        he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which
        he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
015:032 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha
        the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] twenty-four years.
015:034 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
016:001 The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,
016:002 Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over
        my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam,
        and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger
        with their sins;
016:003 behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house;
        and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
016:004 Him who dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies of his in the field shall the birds of
        the sky eat.
016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did,
        and his might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:006 Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah;
        and Elah his son reigned in his place.
016:007 Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
        the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his house,
        both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh,
        to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being
        like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.
016:008 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] two years.
016:009 His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him.  Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk
        in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
016:010 and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him,
        in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned
        in his place.
016:011 It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha:
        he didn't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} neither of his relatives, nor of his friends.
016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
016:013 for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
        which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin,
        to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren't they
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
016:015 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah.  Now the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
016:016 The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired,
        and has also struck the king:  therefore all Israel made Omri,
        the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
016:017 Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him,
        and they besieged Tirzah.
016:018 It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died,
016:019 for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam,
        and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts:
        half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make
        him king; and half followed Omri.
016:022 But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people
        who followed Tibni the son of Ginath:  so Tibni died,
        and Omri reigned.
016:023 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years:
        six years reigned he in Tirzah.
016:024 He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver;
        and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of
        the hill, Samaria.
016:025 Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt
        wickedly above all who were before him.
016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shown, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria;
        and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
016:029 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
        the son of Omri to reign over Israel:  and Ahab the son
        of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
016:030 Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh above all that were before him.
016:031 It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
        in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife
        Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
016:032 He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
        which he had built in Samaria.
016:033 Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel
        who were before him.
016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho:  he laid
        the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,
        and set up the gates of it with the loss of his youngest
        son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        by Joshua the son of Nun.
017:001 Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead,
        said to Ahab, As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years,
        but according to my word.
017:002 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:003 Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself
        by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:004 It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have
        commanded the ravens to feed you there.
017:005 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went
        and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:006 The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
        and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
017:007 It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there
        was no rain in the land.
017:008 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:009 Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon,
        and dwell there:  behold, I have commanded a widow there
        to sustain you.
017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate
        of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks:
        and he called to her, and said, Please get me a little water
        in a vessel, that I may drink.
017:011 As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said,
        Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
017:012 She said, As Yahweh your God lives, I don't have a cake,
        but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar:
        and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake
        it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
017:013 Elijah said to her, Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said;
        but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me,
        and afterward make for you and for your son.
017:014 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall
        not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day
        that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.
017:015 She went and did according to the saying of Elijah:
        and she, and he, and her house, ate [many] days.
017:016 The jar of meal didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail,
        according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah.
017:017 It happened after these things, that the son of the woman,
        the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was
        so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
017:018 She said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you man
        of God?  You have come to me to bring my sin to memory,
        and to kill my son!
017:019 He said to her, Give me your son.  He took him out of her bosom,
        and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode,
        and laid him on his own bed.
017:020 He cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, have you also brought
        evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?
017:021 He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh,
        and said, Yahweh my God, please let this child's soul come
        into him again.
017:022 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
        came into him again, and he revived.
017:023 Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother;
        and Elijah said, Behold, your son lives.
017:024 The woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God,
        and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.
018:001 It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab;
        and I will send rain on the earth.
018:002 Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.  The famine was
        sore in Samaria.
018:003 Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.
        (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:
018:004 for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh,
        that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
018:005 Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs
        of water, and to all the brooks:  peradventure we may find
        grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose
        all the animals.
018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another
        way by himself.
018:007 As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him:
        and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you,
        my lord Elijah?
018:008 He answered him, It is I:  go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is
        here].
018:009 He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your
        servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
018:010 As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom,
        where my lord has not sent to seek you:  and when they said,
        He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation,
        that they didn't find you.
018:011 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
018:012 It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit
        of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I
        come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me:
        but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.
018:013 Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets
        of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh's prophets
        by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
018:014 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
        and he will kill me.
018:015 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        I will surely show myself to him today.
018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
        to meet Elijah.
018:017 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
        Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
018:018 He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
        father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments
        of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
        and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets
        of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
018:020 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
        the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
018:021 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
        waver between the two sides?  If Yahweh is God, follow him;
        but if Baal, then follow him."  The people answered him
        not a word.
018:022 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
        of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.
018:023 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull
        for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood,
        and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull,
        and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
018:024 You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name
        of Yahweh; and the God who answers by fire, let him be God."
        All the people answered, "It is well said."
018:025 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull
        for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many;
        and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."
018:026 They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it,
        and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying,
        Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any who answered.
        They leaped about the altar which was made.
018:027 It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud;
        for he is a god:  either he is musing, or he is gone aside,
        or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleeps and
        must be awakened.
018:028 They cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
        with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.
018:029 It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until
        the time of the offering of the [evening] offering; but there
        was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.
018:030 Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all
        the people came near to him.  He repaired the altar of Yahweh
        that was thrown down.
018:031 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
        of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying,
        Israel shall be your name.
018:032 With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh;
        and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
        contain two measures of seed.
018:033 He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces,
        and laid it on the wood.  He said, Fill four jars with water,
        and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.
018:034 He said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time.
        He said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
018:035 The water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
        also with water.
018:036 It happened at the time of the offering of the [evening] offering,
        that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Yahweh, the God
        of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this
        day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,
        and that I have done all these things at your word.
018:037 Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know
        that you, Yahweh, are God, and [that] you have turned their
        heart back again.
018:038 Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering,
        and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up
        the water that was in the trench.
018:039 When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces:
        and they said, Yahweh, he is God; Yahweh, he is God.
018:040 and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don't let
        one of them escape.  They took them; and Elijah brought them
        down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
018:041 Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there
        is the sound of abundance of rain.
018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.  Elijah went up to the top
        of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put
        his face between his knees.
018:043 He said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.
        He went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.
        He said, Go again seven times.
018:044 It happened at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold,
        a small cloud, like a man's hand, is rising out of the sea."
        He said, Go up, tell Ahab, Make ready [your chariot],
        and get you down, that the rain not stop you.
018:045 It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black
        with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.
        Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:
018:046 and the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he girded up his waist,
        and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
019:001 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had
        killed all the prophets with the sword.
019:002 Then Jezebel send a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let
        the gods do to me, and more also, if I don't make your life
        as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
019:003 When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
        to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came
        and sat down under a juniper tree:  and he requested for himself
        that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Yahweh,
        take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
019:005 He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold,
        an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
019:006 He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked
        on the coals, and a jar of water.  He ate and drink,
        and laid him down again.
019:007 The angel of Yahweh came again the second time, and touched him,
        and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.
019:008 He arose, and ate and drink, and went in the strength of that
        food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God.
019:009 He came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold,
        the word of Yahweh came to him, and he said to him, What are
        you doing here, Elijah?
019:010 He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
        for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant,
        thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword:
        and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
        to take it away.
019:011 He said, Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.
        Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore
        the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh;
        but Yahweh was not in the wind:  and after the wind an earthquake;
        but Yahweh was not in the earthquake:
019:012 and after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire:
        and after the fire a still small voice.
019:013 It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
        in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance
        of the cave.  Behold, there came a voice to him, and said,
        What are you doing here, Elijah?
019:014 He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
        for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant,
        thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword;
        and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
        to take it away.
019:015 Yahweh said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness
        of Damascus:  and when you come, you shall anoint Hazael
        to be king over Syria;
019:016 and Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel;
        and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah shall you anoint
        to be prophet in your room.
019:017 It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael
        shall Jehu kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu
        shall Elisha kill.
019:018 Yet will I leave [me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
        which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has
        not kissed him.
019:019 So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
        who was plowing, with twelve yoke [of oxen] before him,
        and he with the twelfth:  and Elijah passed over to him,
        and cast his mantle on him.
019:020 He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you,
        kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.
        He said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?
019:021 He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen,
        and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments
        of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate.
        Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
020:001 Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together;
        and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots:
        and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
020:002 He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city,
        and said to him, Thus says Ben Hadad,
020:003 Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children,
        even the best, are mine.
020:004 The king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying,
        my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.
020:005 The messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad,
        saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me
        your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;
020:006 but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time,
        and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants;
        and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes,
        they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
        and said, Please notice how this man seeks mischief:
        for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children,
        and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn't deny him.
020:008 All the elders and all the people said to him, Don't you
        listen, neither consent.
020:009 Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my
        lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant
        at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.
        The messengers departed, and brought him word again.
020:010 Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me,
        and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls
        for all the people who follow me.
020:011 The king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don't let him who girds
        on [his armor] boast himself as he who puts it off.
020:012 It happened, when [Ben Hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking,
        he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants,
        Set [yourselves in array]. They set [themselves in array]
        against the city.
020:013 Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said,
        Thus says Yahweh, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold,
        I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
020:014 Ahab said, By whom?  He said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young
        men of the princes of the provinces.  Then he said, Who shall
        begin the battle?  He answered, You.
020:015 Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
        and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them
        he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel,
        being seven thousand.
020:016 They went out at noon.  But Ben Hadad was drinking himself
        drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two
        kings who helped him.
020:017 The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
        and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are
        men come out from Samaria.
020:018 He said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive,
        or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.
020:019 So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes
        of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
020:020 They killed everyone his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel
        pursued them:  and Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on
        a horse with horsemen.
020:021 The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots,
        and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
020:022 The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him,
        Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do;
        for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come
        up against you.
020:023 The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is
        a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we:
        but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
        shall be stronger than they.
020:024 Do this thing:  take the kings away, every man out of his place,
        and put captains in their room;
020:025 and number you an army, like the army that you have lost,
        horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against
        them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
        He listened to their voice, and did so.
020:026 It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered
        the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
020:027 The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned,
        and went against them:  and the children of Israel encamped
        before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians
        filled the country.
020:028 A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel,
        and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said,
        Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys;
        therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand,
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
020:029 They encamped one over against the other seven days.
        So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined;
        and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred
        thousand footmen in one day.
020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell
        on twenty-seven thousand men who were left.  Ben Hadad fled,
        and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
020:031 His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that
        the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings:
        let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our bodies,
        and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel:
        peradventure he will save your life.
020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their bodies, and [put] ropes
        on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said,
        Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live.
        He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
020:033 Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether
        it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben Hadad.
        Then he said, Go you, bring him.  Then Ben Hadad came forth to him;
        and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
020:034 [Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took
        from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets
        for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.
        I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant.
        So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
020:035 A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow
        by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me.  The man refused
        to strike him.
020:036 Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice
        of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me,
        a lion shall kill you.  As soon as he was departed from him,
        a lion found him, and killed him.
020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me.
        The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.
020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
        and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
020:039 As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said,
        Your servant went out into the midst of the battle;
        and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me,
        and said, Keep this man:  if by any means he be missing,
        then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay
        a talent of silver.
020:040 As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.
        The king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be;
        yourself have decided it.
020:041 He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes;
        and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
020:042 He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go
        out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction,
        therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people
        for his people.
020:043 The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry,
        and came to Samaria.
021:001 It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
        had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace
        of Ahab king of Samaria.
021:002 Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may
        have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house;
        and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it:
        or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth
        of it in money.
021:003 Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give
        the inheritance of my fathers to you.
021:004 Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word
        which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said,
        I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.
        He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face,
        and would eat no bread.
021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your
        spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?
021:006 He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,
        and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else,
        if it please you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it:
        and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
021:007 Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom
        of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry:
        I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal,
        and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were
        in his city, [and] who lived with Naboth.
021:009 She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
        Naboth on high among the people:
021:010 and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them
        testify against him, saying, You did curse God and the king.
        Then carry him out, and stone him to death.
021:011 The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived
        in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it
        was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
021:013 The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him:
        and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth,
        in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God
        and the king.  Then they carried him forth out of the city,
        and stoned him to death with stones.
021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned,
        and is dead.
021:015 It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
        and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession
        of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused
        to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
021:016 It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
        rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
        to take possession of it.
021:017 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria:
        behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone
        down to take possession of it.
021:019 You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you
        killed and also taken possession?  You shall speak to him,
        saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked
        the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.
021:020 Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy?
        He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself
        to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.
021:021 Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you
        away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against
        a wall,{or, male} and him who is shut up and him who is left
        at large in Israel:
021:022 and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son
        of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah
        for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger,
        and have made Israel to sin.
021:023 Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat
        Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
021:024 Him who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat;
        and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
021:025 (But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do
        that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel
        his wife stirred up.
021:026 He did very abominably in following idols, according to
        all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before
        the children of Israel.)
021:027 It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes,
        and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth,
        and went softly.
021:028 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
021:029 See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles
        himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days;
        but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.
022:001 They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
022:002 It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
        of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
022:003 The king of Israel said to his servants, "You know that
        Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don't take it
        out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
022:004 He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to
        Ramoth Gilead?  Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am
        as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
022:005 Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first
        for the word of Yahweh.
022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together,
        about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go
        against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?
        They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand
        of the king.
022:007 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides,
        that we may inquire of him?
022:008 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man
        by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah:
        but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me,
        but evil.  Jehoshaphat said, "Don't let the king say so."
022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly
        Micaiah the son of Imlah.
022:010 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
        were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes,
        in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
022:011 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said,
        Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians,
        until they be consumed.
022:012 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead,
        and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand
        of the king.
022:013 The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now,
        the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth:
        please let your word be like the word of one of them,
        and speak you good.
022:014 Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me,
        that will I speak.
022:015 When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah,
        shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?
        He answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver
        it into the hand of the king.
022:016 The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you
        speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
022:017 He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep
        that have no shepherd:  and Yahweh said, These have no master;
        let them return every man to his house in peace.
022:018 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you
        that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
022:019 [Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh:  I saw
        Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven
        standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
022:020 Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up
        and fall at Ramoth Gilead?'  One said on this manner;
        and another said on that manner.
022:021 There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said,
        'I will entice him.'
022:022 Yahweh said to him, 'How?'  He said, 'I will go forth,
        and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'
        He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also:
        go forth, and do so.'
022:023 Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in
        the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken
        evil concerning you."
022:024 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh
        from me to speak to you?
022:025 Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you
        shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
022:026 The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
022:027 and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
        until I come in peace.
022:028 Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not
        spoken by me.  He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramoth Gilead.
022:030 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
        and go into the battle; but put you on your robes.
        The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
022:031 Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains
        of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great,
        save only with the king of Israel.
022:032 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
        that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they
        turned aside to fight against him:  and Jehoshaphat cried out.
022:033 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was
        not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
022:034 A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck
        the king of Israel between the joints of the armor:
        therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand,
        and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.
022:035 The battle increased that day:  and the king was stayed
        up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even;
        and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
022:036 There went a cry throughout the army about the going down
        of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man
        to his country.
022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
        the king in Samaria.
022:038 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked
        up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves [there]);
        according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.
022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did,
        and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that
        he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned
        in his place.
022:041 Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth
        year of Ahab king of Israel.
022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem.
        His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
022:043 He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside
        from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh:
        however the high places were not taken away; the people still
        sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
022:044 Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that
        he shown, and how he warred, aren't they written in the book
        of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
022:046 The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his
        father Asa, he put away out of the land.
022:047 There was no king in Edom:  a deputy was king.
022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold:
        but they didn't go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.
022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
        go with your servants in the ships.  But Jehoshaphat would not.
022:050 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son
        reigned in his place.
022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
        in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        and he reigned two years over Israel.
022:052 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother,
        and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made
        Israel to sin.
022:053 He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
