SIR EDWARD DERING'S[1] HOUSEHOLD BOOK, A.D. 1648-52.


About ten years since, I remember seeing, in the hands of a London
bookseller, a curious MS. purporting to be the "Household Book of
Receipts and Expences of Sir Edward Dering, Bart., of Surrenden Dering,
Kent, from Lady-Day, 1648, to April, 1652." It was a think folio, in the
original binding, entirely in the hand-writing of the distinguished
baronet.

Sir Edward was the only son of Sir Edward Dering, the first baronet, by
his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir John Ashburnham, of Ashburnham,
Sussex, Knt. He succeeded to the baronetcy upon the death of his father,
in 1644, and married Mary, daughter of Daniel Harvey, Esq., of Combe,
Surrey, who was brother of the famous Dr. Harvey, the discoverer of the
circulations of the blood.

The volume commences at Lady-day, 1648, with the gifts of his
grandmother Cramond, and his uncles Dr. Harvey and Eliab Harvey. Nov. 8.
1648, is a memorandum of receipts of "the full remainder of the three
thousand pounds he was to pay me on my marriage." The receipts close
March 25. 1652, with "a note of what money I have received for rent,
wood, &c.; in effect, what I have to live upon, for four years, 1413_l_.
8_s_." The expenses begin at the same period; and among the earliest is,
"given my wife, in gold, 100_l_." Under the date Aug. 4. 1648, we read,
"Item: paid Mr. Edward Gibbes, to the use, and by the appointment of my
sister Dorothy, it being her portion, 1200_l_." Dorothy was probably Sir
Edward's only sister, by the same mother, Sir Edward, the first
baronet's second wife. Her sun of life soon set; for Feb. 21. 1650, a
whole page is occupied with items of mourning "at the death of my deare
and only sister, the Lady Darell."

Independently of the frequent notices of relatives, almost serving as a
family history, there are entries of high interest to the general
historian and the antiquary. The costs of every article of use and
virtue are set down in full, and a few of the items (which I find in my
Common-place Book) will serve as a specimen of the general contents:--

"1648. July 31.  It. for seeing two plaies with my
                  wife, &c., coach hire, &c.,      1_l_.  6_s_.

The entry concerning the Celebrated Henry Lawes, _Milton's Tuneful
Harry_, is very interesting, and is well illustrated by the following
dedication, prefixed to Lawes' _Second Book of Ayres and Dialogues_,
1655:--

     _"To the Honourable the Lady Dering, Wife to Sir Edward Dering, of
     Surenden Dering, Bart._

     "Madam,--I have consider'd, but could not finde it lay in my power,
     to offer this Book to any but your Ladiship. Not only in regard of
     that honour and esteem you have for Musick, but because those Songs
     which fill this Book have receiv'd much lustre by your excellent
     performance of them; and (which I confesse I rejoice to sepak of)
     some, which I esteem the best of these ayres, were of your own
     composition, after your noble husband was pleas'd to give the
     words. For (although your Ladiship resolv'd to keep it private) I
     beg leave to declare, for my own honour, that you are not only
     excellent for the time you spent in the practice of what I set, but
     are yourself so good a composer, that few of any sex have arriv'd
     to such perfection. So as this Book (at least a part of it) is not
     Dedicated, but only brought home to your Ladiship. And here I would
     say (could I do it without sadness), how pretious to my thoughts is
     the memory of your excellent Mother (that great example of prudence
     and charity), whose pious meditations were often advanc'd by
     hearing your voice. I wish all prosperity to your Ladiship, and to
     him who (like yourself) is made up of Harmony; to say nothing of
     the rest of his high accomplishments of wisdome and learning. May
     you both live long, happy in each other, when I am become ashes;
     who, while I am in this world, shall be ever found, Madame,

     "Your Ladiship's humble Admirer
         "and faitnful Servant,
            "HENRY LAWES."

The Derings appear to have been great lovers and patrons of music; and
one of their family, Richard, practised the art as his profession. This
excellent musician was educated in Italy; and, when his education was
completed, he returned to England with great reputation. He resided in
his own country for some time, but, upon a very pressing invitation,
went to Brussels, and became organist to the convent of English nuns
there. From the marriage of Charles I., until the time when that monarch
left England, he was organist to the Queen. In 1610 he was admitted to
the degree of Bachelor in Music at Oxford, and died in the communion of
the Church of Rome, about the year 1657.

BAYSWATER AND ITS ORIGIN.

A piece of topographical history was disclosed at the recent trial of a
cause at Westminster, which it may be worth while to record among your
"Notes." The Dean and Chapter of Westminster are possessed of the manor
of Westbourne Green, in the parish of Paddington, parcel of the
possessions of the extinct Abbey of Westminster. It must have belonged
to the Abbey when _Domesday_ was compiled; for, though neither
Westbourne nor Knightsbridge (also a manor of the same house) is
specially named in that survey, yet we know, from a later record, viz. a
_Quo Warranto_ in 22 Edward I., that both of those manors were members,
or constituent hamlets, of the vill of Westminster, which is mentioned
in _Domesday_ among the lands of the Abbey. The most considerable tenant
under the abbot in this vill was _Bainiardus_, probably the same Norman
associate of the Conqueror who is called Baignardus and Bainardus in
other parts of the survey, and who gave his name to Baynard's Castle.

The descent of the land held by him of the abbot cannot be clearly
traced: but his name long remained attached to part of it; and, as late
as the year 1653, a parliamentary grant of the Abbey or Chapter lands to
Foxcrafte and another, describes "the common field at Paddington" as
being "near a place commonly called _Baynard's Watering_."

In 1720, the lands of the Dean and Chapter in the same common field are
described, in a terrier of the Chapter, to be the occupation of
Alexander Bond, of _Bear's Watering_, in the same parish of Paddington.

The common field referred to, is the well-known piece of garden ground
lying between Craven Hill and the Uxbridge road, called also _Bayswater
Field_.

We may therefore fairly conclude, that this portion of ground, always
remarkable for its springs of excellent water, once supplied water to
Baynard, his household, or his cattle; that the memory of his name was
preserved in the neighbourhood for six centuries; and that his
watering-place now figures on the outside of certain green omnibuses in
the streets of London, under the name of BAYSWATER.

EVA, DAUGHTER OF DERMOT MACMURROUGH.

Being a subscriber to Mr. O'Donovan's new translation of _The Annals of
the Four Masters_, I beg to inform your correspondent, "A HAPLESS
HUNTER" (No. 6, p. 92.), that the copy which I possess begins with the
year 1172; consequently, it is hopeless to refer to the years 1135 and
1169. In 1173 the death of Mulmurry Mac-Murrough is recorded; as also of
Dermot O'Kaelly, from whom the family name of Kelly is derived; but I do
not find any notice of the daughter of Dermot MacMurrough.

If some earlier note-taker has not anticipated me, please to inform your
correspondent from Malvern Wells that the published portion of the
_Annals of the Four Masters_, by O'Donovan, commences with the year
1172. The earlier portion of the _Annals_ is in the press, and will
shortly appear. When it sees the light, your querist will, it is to be
hoped, find an answer. A query, addressed personally, to Mr. O'Donavan,
Queen's College, Galway, would, no doubt, meet with a ready reply from
that learned and obliging Irish scholar and historian.

"A HAPLESS HUNTER" will find, in the _Statute of Kilkenny_ (edited by
James Hardiman, Esq., M.R.I.A. for the Irish Archaeological Society in
1843), pp. 28, 29, _note_, two incidental notices of Eva, daughter of
Dermot McMorrough; the first, her witnessing a grant made by Richard
Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke, during his lifetime; and the second, a
grant made by her to John Comyn, Archbishop of Dublin, in the reign of
Richard I. (at least sixteen years after her husband's death), "pro
salute anime mee et domini comitis Ricardi," &c. Should he not have an
opportunity of consulting the work, I shall have much pleasure in
furnishing the entire extract, on receiving a line from him.

Giraldus Cambrensis mentions, that MacMurrough, having, in the year
1167, procured letters patent from Henry II., repaired to England, and
there induced Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke and Strighul, to engage to aid
him, on condition of receiving, in return, the hand of his _eldest_
daughter, Eva, and the heirship of his dominions.--_Girald. Camb._ p.
761. And further, that Strongbow did not arrive in Ireland until the eve
of St. Bartholomew's day, September, 1170; he was joined at Waterford by
Eva and her father, and the marriage took place a _few days after_, and
_during_ the sacking of that place.--Ibid. p. 773.

"Strongbow left, by his _second_ wife Eva, one daughter, named Isabella,

PLAGIARISMS, OR PARALLEL PASSAGES

I have placed this title in my note-books, more than one instance of
similarity of thought, incident, or expression that I have met with
during a somewhat desultory course of reading. These instances I shall
take the liberty of laying before you from time to time, leaving you and
your readers to decide whether such similarity be the effect of
_accident_ or _design_; but I flatter myself that they may be accepted
as _parallel passages_ and _illustrations_, even by those who may differ
from me in the opinion I have formed on the relation which my "loci
inter se comparandi" bear to each other.

In Lady Blessington's _Conversations with Lord Byron_, pages 176, 177.,
the poet is represented as stating that the lines--

  "While Memory, with more than Egypt's art,
  Embalming all the sorrows of the heart,
  Sits at the altar which she raised to woe,
  And feeds the source whence tears eternal flow!"

suggested to his mind, "by an unaccountable and incomprehensible power
of association," the thought--

     "Memory, the mirror which affliction dashes to the earth, and,
     looking down upon the fragments, only beholds the reflection
     multiplied."

afterwards apparently embodied in _Childe Harold_, iii. 33.

  "Even as a broken mirror, which the glass
  In every fragment multiplies; and makes
  A thousand images of one that was,
  The same, and still the more, the more it breaks."

Now, Byron was, by his own showing, _an ardent admirer_ of Burton's
_Anatomy of Melancholy_. See Moore's _Life of Byron_, vol. i. page 144.
Notices of the year 1807.

Turn to Burton, and you will find the following passage:--

     "And, as Praxiteles did by his glass, when he saw a scurvy face in
     it, brake it to pieces, but for that one, he saw many more as bad
     in a moment."--Part 2. sect. 3. mem. 7.

I am uncharitable enough to believe that _Childe Harold_ owes far more
to Burton, than to "the unaccountable and incomprehensible power of
association."

BILLINGSGATE.

I think your correspondent in No. 6. p. 93., starts on wrong premises;
he seems to take for granted that such a structure as Belin's Gate
really existed. Now the story entirely rests on the assertion of
Geoffrey of Monmouth. What amount of credit may be placed on that
veracious and most unromantic historian, your correspondent doubtless
knows better than myself. Geoffrey says, in the 10th chap. of the 3rd
book, that Belin, among other great works, made a wonderful gate on the
bank of the Thames, and built over it a large tower, and under it a
wharf for ships; and when he died his body was burned, and his ashes put
into a golden urn on the top of the tower. Stow seems to doubt it. In
Strype's edition, 1720, he says, concerning this gate, "Leaving out the
fable thereof faming it to be builded by King Belin, a Briton, long
before the incarnation of Christ." Burton, writing 1722, mentions the
legend, but adds, "But whether of that antiquity is doubted." and John
Brydall, in 1676, mentions it only as a wharf or quay for ships. Now, as
Geoffrey of Monmouth's _Chronicle_ is generally allowed by critics to be
but a mass of romance and monkish legends, built on a slight foundation
of truth, we may suppose this account to partake of the general
character of the rest of the work. That some circumstance gave rise to
the name is not doubted. "Haply," says Stow, "some person of that name
lived near." I look on the name as only a corruption or romantic
alteration of the word Baal or Bel; and, as we have every reason to
suppose he was worshipped by part of the aborigines of this country, I
deem it not improbable that on or near this spot might once have existed
a temple for his worship, which afterwards gave a name to the place. It
is true Baal generally had his temples placed on the summit of lofty
mountains or other eminences. But supposing a number of his votaries to
have settled near London, and on the banks of the Thames, nothing would
be more likely than, to obviate the natural lowness of the ground, they
would raise a tower for the better celebration of the ceremonies
attendant on his worship. This might have been the foundation upon which
Geoffrey built his story. However, I only suggest this. The real origin
of the name I am afraid is too far sunk in oblivion to hold out any
hopes of its being rescued at the present day.

NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES, NO. 4.

In order to forward your views as regards the valuable department of
"Notes from Fly-Leaves" I have spent some leisure hours in _beating the
covers_ of a portion of my library. I send you the produce of my first
day's sport, which, you will observe, has been in the fields of poetry.
Make what use of it you think fit, selecting such notes only as you
think of sufficient interest for publication.

I. Note in the handwriting of Richard Farmer, in a copy of "Canidia, or
the Witches; a Rhapsody in five parts, by R.D." 4to. London, printed by
S. Roycroft for Robert Clavell, 1683.

     "In Mr. Hutton's Catale P. 65. N. 1552. this strange composition is
     ascribed to one Dixon. There was a Robert Dixon, an author about
     the time, and D.D. (Woods's _Fasti_, v. ii. p. 103.), but it surely
     must not be given to him! Qu.? This is the only copy I have seen,
     1785."

     [Lowndes has the work under the name of Robert Dixon, D.D.]

II. Note in the handwriting of James Bindley, in a copy of an English
translation of Milton's "Defensio pro Populo Anglicano," printed in the
year 1692.

     "Translated into English by Richard Washington, Esq., of the Middle
     Temple."

On another page, however, he has written,

     "Mem. in a miscellany called 'Poems on Affairs of State,' 8vo. 5th
     edit. 1703, at page 223 'In memory of _Joseph_ Washington, Esq.,
     late of the Middle Temple, an elegy written by N. Tate, Servant to
     their Majesties.' Though Mr. Warton calls him _Richard_, his name
     was, I believe, as above, and the translator most likely of this
     book.--J.B."

To this is added, in the handwriting of the late Mr. Ford, bookseller,
formerly of Manchester--

     "The note on the opposite side, signed J.B., stands for James
     Bindley, who may be considered as good authority for what is here
     asserted. Some curious information will be found relative to the
     original work in 'Diction. des Livres Condamnés,' &c., par Peignot.
     tom. ii. p 319."

III. Note in the handwriting of Mr. Ford, in a copy of Fletcher's
"Purple Island,", &c. 1633.

     "See the lines at the end by Francis Quarles, which are ingenious
     and poetical. This curious and very rare volume I purchased out of
     Longman's celebrated catalogue of old English poetry, called 'Bib.
     Ang. Poet.,' where it will be found marked £2 12s. 6d., which is
     what it cost me. Mr. Montgomery, the poet, styles this poem a
     fantastical allegory describing the body and soul of man, but
     containing many rich and picturesque passages (v. his 'Christian
     Poem,' p. 163.) But there is a most excellent critique upon it in
     the 'Retrosp. Rev.' for Nov. 1820 (v.p. 351.), but see also
     Headley, who highly praises it. The name of Fletcher ranks high in
     the list of our poets. He was born in 1584, and was the son of Dr.
     Giles Fletcher, who was himself a poet; the brother of Giles
     Fletcher, the author of 'Christ's Victory;' and the cousin of John
     Fletcher, the celebrated dramatist."

IV. In a note on a copy of "Iter Boreale, with large additions of
several other poems, being an exact collection of all hitherto extant;
never before published together. The author R. Wild, D.D., printed for
the booksellers in London, 1668,"--the author is described as "of
Tatenill, near Burton supr Trent." The note is apparently of
contemporary date, or a little later.

This edition is not noticed by Lowndes, nor is another edition
(anonymous), of which I have a copy, the date of which is 1605 (printed
for R.J., and are to be sold in St. Paul's Churchyard). Of course this
date is a mistake, but query what is the real date? Probably 1665. The
volume concludes with the 70th page, being identical with the 72nd page
of the edition of 1668.

V. Note in the handwriting of Mr. Ford, in a copy of "Waller's Poems,"
1645 (after quoting "Rymer on Tragedy," pp. 2. and 79.):--

     "The dedicatory epistle in this first and rare edition 'To my
     Lady,' is omitted in all the subsequent editions, even in Fenton's
     of 1729 (see Dibdin).--I find it _is_ inserted in Fenton's
     edition among the speeches and letters; but he adds, in his
     observations thereon, that it appears not to have been designed for
     a public dedication, though why or wherefore he assigns no reason;
     and he further adds, 'I never met with any tradition to what Lady
     it was originally directed.' It certainly has as much the
     appearance of having been intended for a dedication, _if we may
     judge from internal evidence_, as such sort of things generally
     have. This is the first genuine edition and very scarce. It is
     priced in the 'Bib. Ang. Poet.'; at 2 gs. No. 851. The subsequent
     editions are of no particular value, exception Fenton's elegant and
     complete edition in 4to., which is worth about the same sum."

VI. Note in a handwriting of the 17th century, in a copy of Cawood's
edition of the "Ship of Fools," opposite to the dedication, which is
"Venerandissimo in Christo Patri ac Domino, domino Thomæ Cornissh,
Tenenensis pontifici, ac diocesis Badonensis Suffraganio
vigilantissimo," &c.

     "Thomas Cornish, in 1421-2, was made Suffragan Bishop to Rich. Fox,
     Bp of Bath and Wells, under ye title of 'Episcopus Tynensis,' by wh
     I suppose is meant Tyne, ye last island belonging to ye republick
     of Venice in ye Archipelago. See more of him in 'Athenæ Oxoniens,'
     vol. i. p. 555."

VII. Note by T. Park, in a copy of the third edition of an "Essay on
Human Life," by the author of the "Essay on Man," 1736. (Printed for J.
Witford.)

     "By Lord Pagett. 1st edn 1734. 4to. says Lord Orford. An edn in
     8vo. was printed in 1736 'for Fletcher Gyles against Grays Inn in
     Holbourn,' and was called (as this is) the _third_; but it gave no
     delusive intimation in the title that Pope was the author, honestly
     assigning it to the Right Hon. Lord Pagett. To the preface was
     added a short postscript."

On another page he has written:

     "This is perhaps the most successful imitation of Pope's ethic poem
     which has been produced. Lord Paget has had the credit of composing
     it."

In another handwriting there is written:

     "From Mr. Newton, a valuable present, June 25. 1760."

Under which Mr. Park has added:

     "Qu. from Newton to Cowper, whose handwriting resembles the above."

VIII. I have a little book entitled, "The Original History of Old Robin
Gray; with the adventures of Jenny and Sandy: a Scotch Tale;" n.d.
printed for H. Turpin. A prose narrative, apparently intended for
children, but which Mr. Haslewood has enriched with a number of
newspaper cuttings and other illustrations, and has added the following
note:--

     "Auld Robin Gray; a ballad by the Right Honourable Lady Anne
     Barnard, born Lady Anne Lindsay of Balcarras; Edin. printed by
     James Ballantyne and Co. 1825, qto. This is the first authentic
     edition of this beautiful Scottish ballad, and forms one of the
     publications by Sir Walter Scott as a member of the Bannatyne Club.
     The publication gives an interesting account of the authoress--of
     the origin of the ballad--the ballad--continuation of Auld Robin
     Gray, all from the same hand; it is to be regretted it is not
     published for wider circulation. It will, it may be expected, find
     a vent for the publick at some future period, and some of the
     gatherings in this volume swell a note or two, if not a page.--See
     'Cens. Lib.' vol. ix. p. 323. for another ballad called,
     'Continuation of Auld Robin Gray.' Auld Robin gray's Ghaist begins
     'Right sweetly sang the nightingale,' among my Scotch songs. The
     sequel to Auld Robin Gray begins, 'Full five long years' in do."

OPINIONS ON ENGLISH HISTORIANS.

II. _Lord Clarendon._

     "This great historian is always too free with his judgments. But the
     piety is more eminent than the superstition in this great man's
     foibles."--Bishop Warburton, note, last edition, vol. vii. p. 590.

     "It is to be hoped no more chancellors will write our story, till
     they can divest themselves of that habit of their profession,
     apologising for a bad cause."--H. Walpole, Note in _Historic
     Doubts_.

     "Clarendon was unquestionably a lover of truth, and a sincere
     friend to the free constitution of his country. He defended that
     constitution in Parliament, with zeal and energy, against the
     encroachments of prerogative, and concurred in the establishment of
     new securities for its protection."--Lord Grenville, Note in
     _Chatham Correspondence_, vol. i. p. 113.

     "We suffer ourselves to be delighted by the keenness of Clarendon's
     observations, and by the sober majesty of his style, till we forget
     the oppressor and the bigot in the historian."--Macaulay, _Essays_,
     vol. ii. p. 281.

     "There is no historian, ancient or modern, with whose writings it
     so much behoves an Englishman to be thoroughly conversant, as
     Lord Clarendon."--Southey, _Life of Cromwell_.

     "The genuine text of the history has only been published in 1826,"
     says Mr. Hallam, who speaks of "inaccuracy as habitual to him;" and
     further, "as no one, who regards with attachment the present system
     of the English constitution, can look upon Lord Clarendon as an
     excellent minister, or a friend to the soundest principles of civil
     and religious liberty, so no man whatever can avoid considering his
     incessant deviations from the great duties of an historian as a
     moral blemish on his character. He dares very frequently to say
     what is not true, and what he must have known to be otherwise; he
     does not dare to say what is true, and it is almost an aggravation
     of this reproach, that he aimed to deceive posterity, and poisoned
     at the fountain a stream from which another generation was to
     drink. No defence has ever been set up for the fidelity of
     Clarendon's history; nor can men, who have sifted the authentic
     material, entertain much difference of judgment in this respect;
     though, as a monument of powerful ability and impressive eloquence,
     it will always be read with that delight which we receive from many
     great historians, especially the ancient, independent of any
     confidence in their veracity."--Hallam, _Constitutional History_,
     8vo. vol. ii. p.502.

     "His style is a little long-winded; but, on the other hand, his
     characters may match those of the ancient historians; and one
     thinks they would know the very men if you were to meet them in
     society. Few English writers have the same precision, either in
     describing the actors in great scenes, or the deeds which they
     performed; he was himself deeply engaged in the scenes which he
     depicts, and therefore colours them with the individual feeling,
     and sometimes, doubtless, with the partiality of a partisan. Yet, I
     think he is, on the whole, a fair writer; for though he always
     endeavours to excuse King Charles, yet he points out his mistakes
     and errors, which certainly were neither few nor of slight
     importance."--Scott, _Life by Lockhart_, vol. v. p. 146.

Other opinions as to the noble writer will be found in the _Life of
Calamy_, and in Lord Dover's _Essay_; but I have perhaps trespassed too
much on your space.

MISCELLANIES.

_Books by the Yard_.--Many of your readers have heard of books bought
and sold by weight,--in fact it is questionable whether the _number_ of
books sold in that way is not greater than those sold "over the
counter,"--but few have probably heard of books sold "by the yard."
Having purchased at St. Petersburg, the library left by an old Russian
nobleman of high rank, I was quite astonished to find a copy of _Oeuvres
de Frederic II_. originally published in 15 vols., divided into 60, to
each of which a new title had been printed; and several hundred volumes
lettered outside _Oeuvres de Miss Burney, Oeuvres de Swift,_ &c., but
containing, in fact, all sorts of French waste paper books. These, as
well as three editions of _Oeuvres de Voltaire_, were all very neatly
bound in calf, gilt and with red morrocco backs. My curiosity being
roused, I inquired into the origin of these circumstances, and learnt
that during the reign of Catherine, every courtier who had hopes of
being honoured by a visit from the Empress, was expected to have a
library, the greater or smaller extent of which was to be regulated by
the fortune of its possessor, and that, after Voltaire had won the
favour of the Autocrat by his servile flattery, one or two copies of his
works were considered indispensable. Every courtier was thus forced to
have rooms filled with books, by far the greater number of which he
never read or even opened. A bookseller of the name of Klostermann, who,
being of an athletic stature, was one of the innumerable favourites of
the lady, "who loved all things save her lord," was usually employed,
not to select a library, but to fill a certain given space of so many
yards with books, at so much per volume, and Mr. Klostermann, the
"Libraire de la Cour Imperiale," died worth a plum, having sold many
thousand yards of books (among which I understood there were several
hundred copies of Voltaire), at from 50 to 100 roubles a yard,
"according to the binding."

_Thistle of Scotland_.--R.L. will find the thistle first introduced on
coins during the reign of James V., although the motto "Nemo me impune
lacessit" was not adopted until two reigns later.--See Lindsay's
_Coinage of Scotland_, Longman, 1845.

_Miry-Land Town_. In the _Athenaeum_, in an article on the tradition
respecting Sir Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Dromore's version of the
affair is thus given:--

  "The rain rins doun through Mirry-land toune,
    Sae dois it doune the Pa';
  Sae dois the lads of Mirry-land toune.
    Quhan they play at the Ba'."

In explanation of part of this stanza, Dr. Percy is stated to have
considered "Mirry-land toune" to be "_probably_ a corruption of Milan
(called by the Dutch Meylandt) town," and that the Pa' was "_evidently_
the River Po, though the Adige, not the Po, runs through Milan;" and it
is observed that it could not have occasioned Dr. Jamieson _much
trouble_ to conjecture as he did that "Mirry-land toune" was a
corruption of "Merry Lincolne," and that, in fact, in 1783, Pinkerton
commenced his version of the ballad thus--

  "The bonnie boys o' merry Lincoln;"

and it is added, very truly, that with all his haste and petulance,
Pinkerton's critical acumen was far from inconsiderable. Now, there
appears to me to have been a very simple solution of the above words, so
simple that perhaps it was beneath the critical acumen of the said
commentators. My note on the subject is, that Mirry-land toune means
nothing more than Miry-, Muddy-land Town, a designation that its
situation certainly entitles it to; and Pa' is certainly not the Po, but
an abbreviated form of Pall, i.e. a place to play Ba' or ball in, of
which we have a well-known instance in Pall Mall.

Since writing the above, I recollect that Romsey, in Hampshire, has been
designated "Romsey-in-the-Mud."

_Richard Greene of Lichfield_.--H.T.E. is informed that there is a medal
or token (not difficult to obtain) of this zealous antiquary. Obv. his
bust, in the costume of the period; legend, "Richard Greene, collector
of the Lichfield Museum, died June 4, 1793, aged 77." Rev. a Gothic
_window_, apparently; legend, "West Porch of Lichfield Cathedral, 1800."

_The Lobster in the Medal of the Pretender_.--The "Notes" by your
correspondents, Mr. Edward Hawkins and Mr. J.B. Yates, relative to this
medal, are very curious and interesting, and render it probable that the
device of the Lobster has a religious rather than a political allusion.
But it strikes us that the _double_ introduction of this remarkable
emblem has a more important signification than the mere insidious and
creeping characteristics of Jesuitism. The lines beneath the curious
print in Brandt's _Stultifera Nuvis_ throw no light on the meaning of
the Lobster. We think the difficulty yet remains unsolved.

_Marescautia_.--Your correspondent "D.S." who asks (in No. 6.) for
information upon the word "Marescautia," may consult Du Cange with
advantage, _s. v._ "Marescallus;" the "u," which perhaps was your
correspondent's difficulty, being often written for "l," upon phonotypic
principles. It was anciently the practice to apportion the revenues of
royal and great monastic establishments to some specific branch of the
expenditure; and as the profits of certain manors, &c., are often
described as belonging to the "Infirmaria," the "Camera Abbatis," &c.,
so, in the instance referred to by "D.S." the lands at Cumpton and
Little Ongar were apportioned to the support of the royal stable and
farriery.

_Macaulay's "Young Levite_.--The following is an additional
illustration of Mr. Macaulay's sketch, from Bishop Hall's _Byting
Satyres_, 1599:--

  "A gentle squire would gladly entertaine
  Into his house some _Trencher-chapelaine_;
  Some willing man, that might instruct his sons,
  And that would stand to good conditions.
  First, that he lie upon the truckle-bed,
  While his young master lieth o'er his head;
  Second, that he do, upon no default,
  Never to sit above the salt;
  Third, that he never change his trencher twise;
  Fourth, that he use all common courtesies,
  Sit bare at meales, and one half rise and wait;
  Last, that he never his young master beat,
  But he must aske his mother to define
  How manie jerks she would his breech should line;
  All these observ'd, he could contented be,
  To give five markes, and winter liverie."

_Travelling in England._--I forward you a note on this subject,
extracted, some years ago, from a very quaintly-written _History of
England_, without title-page, but apparently written in the early part
of the reign of George the First. It is among the remarkable events of
the reign of James the First:--

     "A.D. 1621, July the 17th, Bernart Calvert of Andover, rode from
     St. George's Church in Southwark to Dover, from thence passed by
     Barge to Callais in France, and from thence returned back to Saint
     George's Church the same day. This his journey he performed betwixt
     the hours of three in the morning and eight in the afternoon."

This appears to me such a surprising feat, that I think some of your
correspondents may be interested in it; and also may be able to append
farther information.

_Warning to Watchmen._--The following _Warning_, addressed to the
Watchmen of London on the occasion of a great fire, which destroyed
nearly 100 houses in the neighbourhood of Exchange Alley, Birchin Lane,
the back of George Yard, &c., among which were Garraway's, The Jerusalem
Coffee House, George and Vulture, Tom's, &c. &c., is extracted from the
_London Magazine_ for 1748, and is very characteristic of the then state
of the police of the metropolis:--

     "Mr. Touchit's _Warning to the Watchmen of London_. From the
     _Westminster Journal_, April 2nd, No. 331. (1748).

     "Whereas it has been represented to me, _Thomas Touchit_, Watchman
     Extraordinary of the City of _Westminster_, that the Watchmen of
     _London_ were very remiss during the dreadful Fire on _Friday_
     morning, _March_ 25, in not giving timely Notice of that Calamity
     over their several _Beats_, whereby the Friends of many of the
     unhappy Sufferers, who would have flown to their Assistance, were
     ignorant of their Distress till it was too late to do them Service;
     and also that most of the said Watchmen, on other Occasions, are
     very negligent, whence it happens that many Robberies, Burglaries,
     and other Offences, which their Care might prevent, are committed;
     and that even some of them are in Fee with common Harlots and
     Streetwalkers, whom they suffer at unseasonable Hours, unmolested
     to prey on the Virtue, Health and Property of His Majesty's Liege
     Subjects: Be it known to the said Watchmen, and their Masters,
     that, having taken the Premises into Consideration, I intend
     whenever I set out from _Spring Gardens_ with my _invisible Cap_,
     my _irradiating Lanthorn_, and my _Oken Staff_ of correction, to
     take the City of _London_, under Leave of the Right Hon. the Lord
     Mayor, into my Rounds, and to detect, expose, and punish all
     Defaulters in the several Stands and Beats: Whereof this fair
     Warning is given, that none may be surprized in Neglect of Duty, I
     being determined to shew no Favour to such Offenders."

Euston Square, 12th Dec. 1849.

_Aelfric's Colloquy_.--Permit me to correct a singular error into which
the great Anglo-Saxon scholars, Messrs. Lye and B. Thorpe, have been
betrayed by some careless transcriber of the curious _Monastic Colloquy_
by the celebrated Aelfric. This production of the middle ages is very
distinctly written, both in the Saxon and Latin portions, in the Cotton
MS. (Tiberius, A 3, fol. 58_b_.) Mr. Lye frequently cites it, in his
_Saxon Dictionary_, as "_Coll. Mon._," and Mr. Thorpe gives it entire in
his _Analecta Anglo-Saxonica_. The former loosely explains _higdifatu_,
which occurs in the reply of the shoewright (_sceowyrhta_),
thus--"Ca_l_idilia, sc. vasa _quoedam.--Coll. Mon._"--and Mr. Thorpe
prints both _higdifatu_ and _ca_l_idilia_. _Higdifatu_ is manifestly
vessels of hides, such as skin and leather bottles and buckets. The _ig_
is either a clerical error of the monkish scribe for _y_, or the _g_ is
a silent letter producing the quantity of the vowel. "I buy hides and
fells," says the workman, "and with my craft I make of them shoes of
different kinds; leathern hose, flasks, and _higdifatu_." The Latin word
in this MS. is _casidilia_, written with the long straight _s_. Du Cange
explains _capsilis_ to be a vessel of leather, and quotes Matt.
Westmon.: "Portans _cassidile_ toxicum mellitum."--_Gloss_. tom. ii.
col. 387. The root _caps_, or _cas_, does not appear to have any
Teutonic correspondent, and may merit a philological investigation.

_Humble Pie_.--the proverbial expression of "eating humble pie,"
explained by A.G., will be found also explained in the same manner in
the Appendix to Forby's _Vocabulary_, where it is suggested that the
correct orthography would be "umble pie," without the aspirate. Bailey,
in his valuable old _Dictionary_, traces the word properly to
_umbilicus_, the region of the intestines, and acknowledges in his time
the perquisite of the game-keeper.

_By Hook or by Crook_.--You have noted the origin of Humble Pie. May I
add a note of a saying, in my opinion also derived from forest customs,
viz. "By hook or by crook?" Persons entitled to fuel wood in the king's
forest, were only authorised to take it of the dead wood or branches of
trees in the forest, "with a cart, a hook, and a crook."

The answer to the query respecting the meaning of "per serjantiam
Marescautiae," is the Serjeantry of Farriery, i.e. shoeing of the king's
horses. In Maddox, vol. i. p. 43. you will find a very full account of
the office of Marescallus.

"'Tis sung on proud Olympus' hill
    The Muses bear record,
  Ere half the gods had drank their fill

  A thousand Nereids from the flood
    Attend to serve it up.

  "'This nauseous juice,' the monarch cries,
    'Thou darling child of fame,
  Tho' it each earthly clime denies,
    Shall never bathe thy name.

  "'Ye azure tribes that rule the sea,

  Bid _Vernon_ mix a draught for me
    To toast his native land.'

  "Swift o'er the waves the Nereids flew,

  Around the shores they sung 'True Blue,'
    And Britain's hero cheer'd.

  "A mighty bowl on deck he drew,
    And filled it to the brink;
  Such drank the Burford's[2] gallant crew,

     foregoing satisfactory, because early and documentary, evidence of
     the etymology of the now familiar term GROG, informs us that there
     is a still earlier ballad on the subject. We trust that he will be
     enabled to recover that also, and put it on record in our columns.]


_Barnacles_.--In a _Chorographical Description of West, or Il-Jar
Connaught_, by Rhoderic O'Flaherty, Esq., 1684, published by the Irish
Archaeological Society in 1846, the bernacle goose is thus mentioned:--

     "There is the bird engendered by the sea out of timber long lying
     in the sea. Some call them _clakes_, and _soland geese_, and some
     puffins; others _bernacles_, because they resemble them. We call
     them _girrinn_."

     Martin, in his _Western Isles of Scotland_, says:--

     "There are also the _cleek geese_. The shells in which this fowl is
     said to be produced, are found in several isles sticking to trees
     by the bill; of this kind I have seen many,--the fowl was covered
     by a shell, and the head stuck to the tree by the bill,--but never
     saw any of them with life in them upon the tree; but the natives
     told me that they had observed them to move with the heat of the
     sun."--See also Gratianus, Lucius, Ware's _Antiquities_, &c.

Eating sea-birds on fast days is a very ancient custom. Socrates
mentions it in the 5th century: "Some along with fish eat also birds,
saying, that according to Moses, birds like fish were created out of the
waters." Mention is made in Martin's _Western Isles_, of a similar
reason for eating _seals_ in Lent. _Cormorants_, "as feeding only on
fish," were allowable food on fast days, as also were _otters_.

_Vondel's Lucifer_.--I cannot inform your correspondent F. (No. 9 p.
142.), whether Vondel's _Lucifer_ has ever been translated into English,
but he will find reasons for its not being worth translating, in the
_Foreign Quarterly Review_ for April, 1829, where the following passage
occurs:--

     "Compare with him Milton, for his _Lucifer_ gives the fairest means
     of comparison. How weak are his highest flights compared with those
     of the bard of Paradise! and how much does Vondel sink beneath him
     in his failures! Now and then the same thought may be found in
     both, but the points of resemblance are not in passages which do
     Milton's reputation the highest honour."

The scene of this strange drama is laid in Heaven, and the _dramatis

     Emmerich. It was again printed at Delft in 1607; and there have
     been several editions since that date. The curious history of this
     romance has been well investigated by H. Düntzer, _Die Sage von
     Doctor Johannes Faust_, in the 5th volume of _Das Kloster_; and
     even more fully by the Freiherr v. Reichlien Meldegg, in the 11th
     volume of the same work.]


_To Fettle_.--Your correspondent L.C.R. (p. 142) is referred to the late
Mr. Roger Wilbraham's _Cheshire Glossary_, or (as he modestly termed it)
_An Attempt_, &c. This work, privately printed in 1820, is the
republication, but with _very considerable additions_, of a paper in the
_Archaeologia_, vol. xix.

The explanation of the present word is an instance of this expansion.

Your correspondent and Mr. W. agree as to the meaning of this verb, viz.
"to mend, to put in order any thing which is broken or defective." Being
used in this sense, Mr. W. differs from Johnson and Todd, and he is
inclined to derive Fettle from some deflection of the word _Faire_,
which comes from Latine _Facere_. I must not crowd your columns further,
but refer to the _Glossary_.

May I point out rather a ludicrous misprint (doubtless owing to an
illegible MS.) at p. 120. For Mr. Pickering's _Lives_, read _Series_ of
Aldine Poets.

_Ptolemy of Alexandria_.--Your correspondent, "QUERY," wishes to be
informed what works of Ptolemy have been translated. The following, as
far as I can learn, is a list of them, viz.:--

     "The Compost of Ptholomeus, Prynce of Astronomye, translated out of
     the Frenche into Englysshe." London, printed by Robert Wyer, no
     date, 12mo. There is also another edition of the same work, London,
     printed by T. Colwell, without date, 12mo.

     "The Bounding of Greece-Land, according to Ptolomeus; Englished out
     of the Greek, by Thos. Wilson." London, 1570, 4to.

N.B. This is included in Wilson's translation of Demosthenes'
_Olynthiacs_.

     "The Geography of Ptolemy, so far as it relates to Britain; in
     Greek and English, with observations by J. Horsley." London, 1732,
     folio.

N.B. This forms a part of the _Britannia Romana_.

     "Quadripartite; or Four Books concerning the Influence of the
     Stars, faithfully rendered into English, from Leo Allatius; with
     Notes, explaining the most difficult and obscure Passages, by John
     Whalley." London, 1701 and 1786, 12mo.

     "Tetrabiblos, or Quadripartite; being Four Books, of the Influence
     of the Stars, newly translated from the Greek Paraphrase of
     Proclus; with a Preface, explanatory Notes, and an Appendix
     containing Extracts from the Almagest of Ptolemy, and the whole of
     his Colloquy, &c. by J.M. Ashmand." London, 1822, 8vo.

I am indebted to Watt's _Bibliotheca Britannica_ for the titles of the
first three of these works. The others I have in my possession.

There are several real or pretended translations of the _astrological_
work--some certainly pretended--and Ptolemy's name is on many
astrological titlepages which do not even pretend to translate. The
Geography, as far as Britain is concerned, is said to be in Dr. Henry's
_History of Great Britain_, 1788. Some works in harmonics appear in
lists as translations or close imitations of Ptolemy, as John Keeble's,
1785, Francis Styles, _Phil. Trans_. vol. li. Various dissertations on
minor pieces exist: but there is no English translation of the
_Almagest_, &c., though it exists in French (see Smith's _Biograph.
Dict_. art. PTOLEMY). If an English reader wants to know Ptolemy's
astronomical methods and hypotheses, nothing will suit him better than
Narrien's _History of Astronomy_.

_Accuracy of References_.--In connection with the article on
"Misquotations," in No. 3. p.38., will you impress upon your
correspondents the necessity of exact references? It is rather hard
when, after a long search, a sought reference has been obtained, to find
that the reference itself is, on examination, incorrect. To illustrate
my position: at p. 23., in an article relating to Judge Skipwyth, and at
p. 42., in an article relating to the Lions in the Tower, references to
certain "pp." of the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer. Now if any person
with these references were to search the Issue Rolls, he would be much
surprised to find that the Rolls are rolls, and not books, and that
"pp." is not the correct reference. The fact is that neither of your
correspondents are quoting from the Rolls themselves, but from a volume,
published in 1835, under the direction of the Comptroller General of the
Exchequer, by Mr. F. Devon, called _Issue Roll of Thomas de Brantingham,
Bishop of Exeter, Lord High Treasurer of England_, &c. 44 Edward III.

And while on the subject, permit me to remark, with reference to the
article on the Domestic Expenses of Queen Elizabeth (page 41.), that
there are plenty of such documents in existence, and that the only test
of their value and authenticity is a reference to where they may be
found, which is wanting in the article in question.

_A Peal of Bells_.--In No. 8 of your interesting and valuable journal, I
find a query, from the REV. A. GATTY, relative to a peal of bells. Now
the science of bell-ringing being purely English, we can expect to find
the explanation sought for, only in English authors. Dr. Johnson says
peal means a "succession of sounds;" and in this way it is used by many
old writer, thus:--

  "A peal shall rouse their sleep."--MILTON.

And again Addison:--

  "Oh for a peal of thunder that would make
  Earth, sea, and air, and heaven, and Cato tremble."

Bacon also hath it:--

     "Woods of oranges will smell into the sea perhaps twenty miles; but
     what is that, since a peal of ordnance will do as much, which
     moveth in a small compass?"

It is once used by Shakespeare, _Macbeth_:--

  "Ere to black Hecate's summons
  The shard-borne beetle, with drowsy hums,
  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
  A deed of dreadful note."

Will not ringing a peal, then, mean a succession of sweet sounds caused
by the ringing of bells in certain keys? Some ringers begin with D flat;
others, again, contend they should begin in C sharp.

In your last number is a query about _Scarborough Warning_. Grose, in
his _Provincial Glossary_, give the meaning as "a word and a blow, and
the blow first;" it is a common proverb in Yorkshire. He gives the same
account of its origin as does Ray, extracted from Fuller, and gives no
notion that any other can be attached to it.

QUERIES.


CATACOMBS AND BONE-HOUSES.

I should be very glad to have some distinct information on the above
subject, especially in explanation of any repositories of human bones in
England? Was the ancient preservation of these skeleton remains always
connected with embalming the body?--or drying it, after the manner
described by Captain Smythe, R.N., to be still practised in
Sicily?--and, in cases in which dry bones only were preserved, by what
process was the flesh removed from them? for, as Addison says, in
reference to the catacombs at Naples, "they must have been full of
stench, _if_ the dead bodies that lay in them were left to rot in open
niches." The catacombs at Paris seem to have been furnished with bones
from the emptyings of the metropolitan churchyards. In some soils,
however, the bones rot almost as soon as the flesh decays from them.

There are, possibly, many bone-houses in England. I have seen two of
considerable extent, one at Ripon Minster, the other at Rothwell Church,
in Northamptonshire; and at both places skulls and thigh bones were
piled up, in mural recesses, with as much regularity as bottles in the
bins of a wine-cellar. At Rothwell there was (twenty years ago) a great
number of these relics. The sexton spoke of there being 10,000 skulls,
but this, no doubt, was an exaggeration; and he gave, as the local
tradition, that they had been gathered from the neighbouring field of
Naseby. A similar story prevails at Ripon, viz. that the death-heads and
cross-bones, which are arranged in the crypt under the Minster, are the
grisly gleanings of some battle-field.

Now, if these, and other like collections, were really made after
battles which took place during any of the civil wars of England, some
details would not be unworthy of the notice of the picturesque
historian; _e.g._, was it the custom in those unhappy days to disinter,
after a time, the slightly-buried corpses, and deposit the bones in the
consecrated vault?--or was this the accidental work of some antiquarian
sexton of the "Old Mortality" species?--or was the pious attention
suggested by the ploughman's later discoveries--

     "Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro," &c.?

Any report from the places where there happen to be bone-houses,
together with the local tradition assigning their origin, would I think,
throw light on an interesting and rather obscure subject.

CONTRADICTIONS IN DON QUIXOTE; AND QUERY AS TO THE BUSCAPIÉ.

In answer to the question of "MELANION" (in No. 5 p. 73.), it may be
sufficient to refer him to the Spanish editions with notes, viz. that of
Pellicer in 1800; the 4th edition of the Spanish Academy in 1819; and
that of D. Diego Clemencin in 1833, where he will find the discrepancies
he mentions pointed out. In the first edition of 1605 there was another
instance in the same chapter, which Cervantes corrected in the edition
of 1608, but overlooked the other two. It was one of those lapses, _quas
incuria fudit_, which great writers as well as small are subject to.
Clemencin laughs at De los Rios for thinking it a chracteristic of great
geniuses so to mistake; and at the enthusiasm of some one else, who said
that he preferred the Don Quixote with the defects to the Don Quixote
without them.

Having answered one query, I presume I may be permitted to propose one,
in which I feel much interested.

Is the recently published BUSCAPIÉ the work of Cervantes? We have now
been favoured with two translations, one by Thomasina Ross, the other by
a member of the University of Cambridge, under the title of _The Squib,
or Searchfoot_; the latter I have read with some attention, but not
having been able to procure the Spanish original, I should be glad to
have the opinion of some competent Spanish scholar who has read it, as
to its genuineness. My own impression is that it will prove an ingenious
(perhaps innocent?) imposture. The story of its discovery in a
collection of books sold by auction at Cadiz, and its publication
_there_ by Don Adolfo de Castro, in the first place, rather excites
suspicion. My impression, however, is formed from the evident artificial
structure of the whole. Still, not having seen the original, I confess
myself an imperfect judge, and hope that this may meet the eye of one
competent to decide.

ANCIENT ALMS-BASINS.

I have read the various notices in Nos. 3, 5, and 6. on the subject of
these dishes. I have an electrotype copy from such a dish, the original
of which is in Manchester. The device is like No. 4. of those of
CLERICUS (No. 3. p. 44.); but two circles of inscription extend round
the central device (the Grapes of Escol), in characters which are
supposed to be Saracenic. The inner inscription is five times, the outer
seven times, repeated in the round. I see by the _Archaeological
Journal_, No. 23, for Sept. 1849 (pp.295-6.), that at the meeting of
Archaeological Institute, on the 1st June last, Mr. Octavius Morgan,
M.P., exhibited a collection of ancient salvers or chargers, supposed to
be of latten; several ornamented with sacred devices and inscriptions,
including some remarkable examples of the curious florid letter, forming
legends, which have so long perplexed antiquaries in all parts of
Europe. Mr. Morgan arranged the devices in four classes, the first being
chargers or large dishes, supposed by him to have been fabricated at
Nuremburg. The northern antiquary, Sjöborg, who has written much on the
subject, calls them baptismal or alms dishes. Their most common devices
are, Adam and Eve (probably the No. 3. of CLERICUS), St. George, and the
Grapes of Eschol (No. 4. of CLERICUS). On one of those exhibited was the
Annunciation (No. 2. of CLERICUS). On these facts I wish to put the
following queries:--

1. Are Sjöborg's works known to any of your readers?

2. In what language does he suppose the characters to be?

MINOR QUERIES.

_Cupid Crying._--I shall be obliged if you, or any of your
correspondents, can tell me who was the author of the epigram, or
inscription, of which I subjoin the English translation. I am sure I
have seen the Latin, but I do not know whose it was or where to find it;
I think it belongs to one of the Italian writers of the fifteenth or
sixteenth century:--

"CUPID CRYING.

  "Why is Cupid crying so?--
    Because his jealous mother beat him.--
  What for?--For giving up his bow
    To Coelia, who contrived to cheat him.

  "The child! I could not have believed
    He'd give his weapons to another.--
  He would not; but he was deceived:
    She smiled; he thought it was his mother."

RUFUS.

_Was not Sir George Jackson "Junius?"_--Among the names which have been
put forward as claimants to be "Junius," I beg to propose the name of
SIR GEORGE JACKSON, who was, I believe, about that time Secretary to the
Admiralty. I shall be glad to know what obstacles are opposed to this
theory, as I think I have some presumptive evidence (I do not call it
strong), which seems to show either that he was "Junius," or a party
concerned.

_Ballad of Dick and the Devil._--About the middle of the seventeenth
century, occasionally resided, on the large island in Windermere, a
member of the ancient but now extinct family of Philipson, of Crooke
Hall. He was a dashing cavalier, and, from his fearless exploits, had
acquired among the Parliamentarians the significant, though not very
respectable, cognomen of "Robin the Devil."

On one of these characteristic adventures, he rode, heavily armed, into
the large old church at Kendal, with the intention of there shooting an
individual, from whom he had received a deeply resented injury. His
object, however, was unaccomplished, for his enemy was not present; and
in the confusion into which the congregation were thrown by such a
warlike apparition, the dauntless intruder made his exit, though
subjected to a struggle at the church door. His casque, which was
captured in the skirmish that there took place, is yet to be seen in the
church, and the fame of this redoubtable attempt, which was long held in
remembrance through the country side, excited the poetic genius of a
rhymer of the day to embody it in a ballad, entitled "Dick and the
Devil," which is now rare and difficult to be met with.

As my endeavours to light on a copy have been unavailing, and my
opportunities for research are limited, perhaps some one of your
numerous readers who may be versed in the ballad poetry of the age of my
hero, will kindly take the trouble to inform me whether he has ever met
with the ballad in question, or direct me to where it may most likely be
found.

I trust that from the obliging communications of some of your valuable
literary correspondents, I may be so fortunate as to meet with the
object of my query.

_Erasmus' Paraphrase on the Gospels._--I have in my charge the mutilated
remains of an old black-letter copy of _Erasmus' Paraphrase on the
Gospels_, not of any great value perhaps, but interesting to me from its
having been chained from time immemorial (so to speak) to one of the
stalls in our parish church; it is only perfect from Mark, fol. lxiiii.
to John fol. cxiii., but I should be glad to know the date, &c. of its
publication. Presuming, therefore, that one of the objects of your
interesting publication is to aid in solving the _minor_ difficulties of
persons like myself, who have no means of consulting any large
collection of books, I have the less scruple in forwarding the
accompanying "Notes" from my copy, for the guidance of any one who will
be at the trouble of comparing them with any copy to which he may have
access.

The spelling of the word "gospel" varies throughout; thus, in Mark,
fols. lxiiii-lxxii., xci., xciv., xcv., xcvii., and xcviii. it is
"ghospel;" on lxxiii-lxxvi., lxxviii., it is "gospell;" on the rest
"gospel." So also throughout St. Luke, which occupies cc. foll., it
varies in like manner, "ghospell" being there the more common form. The
initial letter to St. Luke represents Jacob's dream; on the first page
of fol. vi. of St. Luke the translator's preface ends, "Geven at London
the last day of Septembre, in the yere of our Lorde M.D.XLV." On fol.
xiii. of the same, Erasmus' own preface ends, "Geven at Basill the xxii.
dai of August ye yere of our Lord, M.D." (the rest effaced). On the
first page of fol. viii. of St. John's Gospel the preface ends, "Geven
at Basile the yere of our Lord, M.D.XXIII. the v daye of Januarye." If
these notes are sufficient to identify my copy with any particular
edition, it will afford a real pleasure to

_Iland Chest._--In some wills of Bristol merchants of the latter part of

_"Iland Chest:"_ thus, ex.g. "Item: to Edmond Poyley I give the Iland
chest in the great chamber wherein his linen was." Mention is made of
the like article in two or three other instances. An explanation of the

I possess an imperfect copy--a small quarto? 2. What is the etymology of
the game Blind Man's _Buff?_ I am led to doubt whether that was the old
spelling of it, for in a catalogue now before me I find a quarto work by
Martin Parker, entitled _The Poet's Blind Man's Bough, or Have among you
my Blind Harpers,_ 1641. 3. What is the origin of the word _muffin?_ It
is not in _Johnson's Dictionary._ Perhaps this sort of tea-cake was not
known in his day. 4. By what logic do we call one hundred and _twelve_
pounds merely a hundred weight? 5. I shall feel still more obliged if
your readers can inform me of any works on natural history, particularly
adapted for a literary man to refer to at times when poetical,
mythological, scriptural, and historical associations connected with
animals and plants are in question. I am constantly feeling the want of
a work of the kind to comprehend zoological similes and allusions, and
also notices of customs and superstitions connected with animals, when
reading our old poets and chroniclers. Even the most celebrated
zoological works are of no use to me in such inquiries.

_Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham._--Having employed my leisure for many

"King of the Isle of Man;" and (3.) How he became dispossessed of that
title, which it is well known that Edward II. bestowed upon Gaveston;
and whether that circumstance did not induce him to take part with the
confederate barons who eventually destroyed that favourite.

Other incongruities occur in my researches, but the above are the most

ONE THAT INTENDS TO BE A REGULAR SUBSCRIBER TO THE "NOTES AND QUERIES."

_Curious Welsh Custom._--A custom prevails in Wales of carrying about at
Christmas time a horse's skull dressed up with ribbons, and supported on
a pole by a man who is concealed under a large white cloth. There is a
contrivance for opening and shutting the jaws, and the figure pursues
and bites every body it can lay hold of, and does not release them
except on payment of a fine. It is generally accompanied by some men
dressed up in a grotesque manner, who, on reaching a house, sing some
extempore verses requesting admittance, and are in turn answered by
those within, until one party or the other is at a loss for a reply. The
Welsh are undoubtedly a poetical people, and these verses often display
a good deal of cleverness. This horse's head is called _Mari Lwyd,_
which I have heard translated "grey mare." _Llwyd_ certainly is grey,
but _Mari_ is not a mare, in Welsh. I think I have heard that there is
some connection between it and the camel which often appears in old
pictures of the Magi offering their gifts. Can any of your readers
inform me of the real meaning of the name, and the origin of the custom,
and also whether a similar custom does not prevail in some parts of

     "About 30 yeares since it happend in Wilshire, at Juy church, about
     twoo miles from Salisbury, as men digged to make a foundation, they
     founde an hollowe stone covered with another stone, wherein they
     founde a booke, having in it little above xx leaves, (as they
     sayde) of verye thicke velume, wherein was some thing written. But
     when it was shewed to priestes and chanons, which were there, they
     would not read it. Wherefore after they had tossed it from one to
     another (by the meanes whereof it was torne) they did neglect and
     cast it aside. Long after, a piece thereof happened to come to my
     handes; which notwithstanding it was al to rent and defaced, I
     shewed to mayster Richarde Pace, then chiefe Secretarie to the

     and that he perceyved this word _Prytania_ to bee put for
     _Brytannia_. But at that time he said no more to me."

Cooper's conjecture founded on this is that Britain is derived from the
Greek word Prytania, which, according to Suidas, "doth," with a
circumflexed aspiration, "signifie metalles, fayres, and markets."
"Calling the place by that which came out of it, as one would say, _hee
went to market_, when he goeth to Antwarpe," &c. Has this been noticed
elsewhere?

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

The announcement recently made in _The Athenæum_ of the intention of the
Government to print in a neat and inexpensive form, a series of
Calendars or Indices of the valuable historical documents in the State
Paper Office, cannot but be very gratifying to all students of our
national history--in the first place, as showing an intention of opening
those documents to the use of historical inquirers, on a plan very
different from that hitherto pursued; and, in the next, it is to be
hoped, as indicating that the intention formerly announced of placing
the State Paper Office under the same regulation as the _Record
Offices_, with the drawback of fees for searches, is not to be
persevered in.

To the citizens of London, to its occasional visitants, as well as to
the absent friends and relatives of those who dwell within its walls,
Mr. Archer's projected work, entitled _Vestiges of Old London, a series
of finished Etchings from original Drawings, with Descriptions,
Historical Associations and other References_, will be an object of
especial interest. The artistical portion will, we believe, be mainly
founded on the collection of drawings in the possession of William
Twopeny, Esq., while the literary illustrations will be derived entirely
from original sources, and from the results of careful observation and
inquiry.

It is said to have been a rule with Charles Fox to have every work bound
in one volume if possible, although published in two or three. The
public have long felt the convenience of such an arrangement; and the
great booksellers have very wisely gratified their wishes in that
respect. The handsome "monotome" edition of _The Doctor_ is doubtless
well known to our readers. The success of that experiment has, we
presume, induced Messrs. Longman to announce the _Complete Works of the
Rev. Sydney Smith_, and _Mr. Macaulay's Critical Essays_, in the same
cheap and convenient form. We believe, too, that another (the sixth)
edition of that gentleman's _History of England from the Accession of
James II._, is on the eve of publication.

Those of our readers who take an interest in that widely spread and
popular subject, _The Dance of Death_, will remember that one of the
most exquisite works of art in which expression is given to the idea on
which this pictorial morality is founded, is the Alphabet Dance of
Death--so delicately engraved on wood, (it is sometimes said by Holbein,
who designed it,) but really by H. Lutzelburger, that the late Mr. Douce
did not believe it could ever be copied so as to afford any adequate
impression of the beauty of the original. A German artist, Heinrich
Loedel, has, however, disproved the accuracy of this opinion; and the
amateur may now, for a few shillings, put himself in possession of most
admirable copies of a work which is a masterpiece of design, and a gem
in point of execution, and of which the original is of the extremest
rarity. There are two editions of this Alphabet; one published at
Gottingen, with an accompanying dissertation by Dr. Adolf Ellisen; and
the other at Cologne, with corresponding borders by Georg Osterwald.

The revised and much enlarged edition of Dr. Lingard's _History of
England_, handsomely printed in ten large octavo volumes, is, we
understand, nearly ready for publication.

Mr. M.A. Lower, whose _Curiosities of Heraldry_ and _English Surnames_
are no doubt well known to many of our readers, is preparing for
publication a Translation, from a MS. in the British Museum, of _The
Chronicle of Battel Abbey from the vow of its Foundation by William the
Conqueror, to the Year 1176, originally compiled in Latin, by a Monk of
the Establishment._

Mr. Thorpe, 13. Henrietta Street, has just issued "A Catalogue of most
choice, curious, and excessively rare Books, particularly rich in Early
Poetry, Mysteries, Pageants, and Plays, and Romances of Chivalry." This
Catalogue is also extremely rich in Madrigals set to Music, by eminent
Composers of Queen Elizabeth's reign--and contains an unrivalled series
of Jest Books, and also of Song Books.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
