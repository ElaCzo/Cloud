Emquanto cá por fóra o povo em romaria
Ia buscar ao campo a rustica alegria,
Emquanto os beberrões de capa de cambraia
Passeavam andor's nos sitios d'Atalaya,
Na torre negregada, a bastilha do mar,
Uma tragedia triste estava-se a passar.

Quem as ondas domou, domou o furacão,
Da tempestade riu e zombou do trovão,
Quem viu o vasto oceano em vagas tormentosas
Tornar em vivo inferno um lindo mar de rosas,
Quem nunca vacillou em arriscar a vida
Sustendo do gentio a rude arremettida,
Estava ali curvado, a fronte bem submissa,
Com sede de razão á espera de justiça.

Nas suas almas sãs de bravos marinheiros
Todos uma familia, amigos e companheiros,
Onde só a excepção pôz vis denunciantes,
Trastes sem cotação, emeritos tratantes,
Havia côr de rosa a lisongeira esp'rança
De ver luzir no céo o arco da bonança.

E quem estava ali ouvindo o julgamento,
Vendo tudo cahir sem base ou fundamento,
Quem via sossobrar a velha accusação
De tetrica revolta ou negra sedição,
Quem via que um protesto unanime, geral,
Fôra do movimento a causa inicial,
Calculava que o fim de tanta crueldade
Seria um acto bom de generosidade.

Porém, surgiu ali a D. Disciplina,
Cabello em desalinho, a garra que é tigrina
Adunca e collossal; a hysterica madona,
A serodia vestal, a bellica matrona,
Tinha sido offendida em seu pudor immenso,
Um pudor que rescende a perfumes e incenso.
Oh! não! bradou convulsa; oh! não, não póde ser?
Não póde haver piedade, eu quero-os ver soffrer!
Que importa o coração? Enterre-se a bondade,
É preciso um exemplo a toda a humanidade!

Soffram os bofetões, as rudes chibatadas,
Os dias no porão, as algemas fechadas,
Tenham do pão e agua o ephemero alimento,
Tudo o que o meu poder impõe como tormento!
Nem um gesto sequer de simples desagrado,
Senão, se ouço gritar... verão o resultado!
Esta torre aqui 'stá, conhece muita magua,
Nas humidas prisões entra em cachões a agua;
Quem não me obedecer ha de rolar no abysmo,
Morrerá como um cão, de dor's e reumathismo.
Findou a inquisição, diz se p'r'ahi a esmo.
A torre 'inda cá está, e vem a dar no mesmo!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
E com immensa dôr, os peitos palpitantes,
Lagrimas o brotar de mães pobres velhinhas,
Na branca lividez de esposas soluçantes,
Nos choros infantis de pobres creancinhas,
Levantando a cabeça em gargalhada f'rina,
'Inda mais uma vez venceu a Disciplina!

*

Ó velha Disciplina, ó serodia vestal
De palmito e capella, os cabellos pintados,
A virginal grinalda, á laia d'avental,
O rosto convulsivo a desfazer-se em brados.
Ó ginja delambida, ó velha sem razão,
Vamos fazer autopsia ao vosso coração.

Sabeis o que é amar, ter mãe e ter irmãs,
Velhas a sustentar, creanças a manter,
Noivas todas paixão em suas almas sãs
O futuro, uma vida, a aspiração d'um ser?
Não o sabeis decerto, ó bellica matrona
Austera Disciplina, ó velha solteirona.

Quem não se quiz curvar á vossa tyrannia
Tem de gemer alli em funebre masmorra,
Liberdade, Egualdade, isso é uma utopia
É vosso o mundo inteiro, e quem protestar: morra!
Ó como é triste e vil, o mundo, a humanidade
Quando não quer subir ao solio da bondade.
Onde tendes matrona, o coração sensivel
Proprio d'um peito bom, que tem ao rigor asco
Que dicta uma sentença ignobil e terrivel
Com toda a placidez d'um cynico carrasco.
Onde guardaes essa alma, escura, empedernida,
Que incensando o rigor dispõe de muita vida?...

Remirando os galões, bonitos reluzentes,
Onde a vaidade pôz scintilações a rôdos,
Julgae-vos superior a todos os mais entes
Nascidos como vós, mortaes como nós todos.
E senhora feudal, ó velha Disciplina
Cravaes a garra adunca, a tetrica assassina!

Lá vão tristes viver em lugubres prisões
Em climas de matar os pobres marinheiros,
Annos a soluçar na febre das paixões,
As saudades dos seus, o amor dos companheiros.
Condemnados, porquê? Por terem dignidade.
O espirito do bem, da solidariedade!

E vós, velha matrona a rir como perdida
Talvez inda acheis pouco o rude soffrimento;
Onde é que vos guardaes ó velha delambida
As mais simples noções do humano sentimento?
Não póde haver autopsia ao vosso coração...
Ó velha Disciplina, ó estupido chavão!

Emquanto o povo inteiro, os peitos soluçantes
Esperava de vós um acto de justiça,
De codigo na mão os olhos coruscantes
Eivada de rancor entraveis já da liça
E de bocca a espumar, terrivel colossal,
Dictaveis a sentença onde imperava o mal.

Ó velha Disciplina, ó tola potestade,
Ó funebre espantalho, ó velha rabujenta.
Deixae essa «imposant» de grande magestade
Que no seculo vinte é triste e não se aguenta.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A cova está aberta, entrae ó Disciplina,
Cavou-a esse rigor: morrei ó assassina!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
