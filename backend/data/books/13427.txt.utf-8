NOTES.

FOLK LORE.

_The First Mole in Cornwall; a Morality from the Stowe of Morwenna, in
the Rocky Land._--A lonely life for the dark and silent mole! She glides
along her narrow vaults, unconscious of the glad and glorious scenes of
earth, and air, and sea! She was born, as it were, in a grave, and in
one long living sepulchre she dwells and dies! Is not existence to her a
kind of doom? Wherefore is she thus a dark, sad exile from the blessed
light of day? Hearken! Here, in our own dear Cornwall, the first mole
was a lady of the land! Her abode was in the far west, among the hills
of Morwenna, beside the Severn sea. She was the daughter of a lordly
race, the only child of her mother, and the father of the house was
dead. Her name was Alice of the Lea. Fair was she and comely, tender and
tall; and she stood upon the threshold of her youth. But most of all did
men wonder at the glory of her large blue eyes. They were, to look upon,
like the summer waters, when the sea is soft with light! They were to
her mother a joy, and to the maiden herself--ah! benedicite--a pride.
She trusted in the loveliness of those eyes, and in her face, and
features, and form: and so it was that the damsel was wont to pass the
summer's day, in the choice of rich apparel, and precious stones, and
gold. Howbeit this was one of the ancient and common customs of those
old departed days. Now, in the fashion of her stateliness, and in the
hue and texture of her garments, there was none among the maidens of old
Cornwall like Alice of the Lea. Men sought her far and nigh, but she was
to them all, like a form of graven stone, careless and cold. Her soul
was set upon a Granville's love, fair Sir Bevil of Stowe, the flower of
the Cornish chivalry--that noble gentleman! that valorous knight! He was
her star. And well might she wait upon his eyes; for he was the garland
of the west--the loyal soldier of a sainted king. He was that stately
Granville who lived a hero-life, and died a warrior's death!

Now there was signal made of banquet in the halls of Stowe, of wassail,
and the dance. The messengers had sped, and Alice of the Lea would be
there. Robes, precious and many, were unfolded from their rest, and the
casket poured forth jewel and gem, that the maiden might stand before
the knight victorious! It was the day--the hour--the time. Her mother
sate by her wheel at the hearth. The page waited in the hall. She came
down in her loveliness into the old oak room, and stood before the
mirrored glass. Her robe was of woven velvet, rich, and glossy, and
soft; jewels shone like stars in the midnight of her raven hair, and on
her hand there gleamed, afar off, a bright and glorious ring! She {226}
stood--she gazed upon her own countenance and form, and worshipped! "Now
all good angels succour thee, dear Alice, and bend Sir Bevil's soul!
Fain am I to see thee a wedded wife, before I die! I yearn to hold thy
children on my knee! Often shall I pray to-night that the Granville
heart may yield! Thy victory shall be my prayer!"

"Prayer!" was the haughty answer; "with the eyes that I see in that
glass, and this vesture meet for a queen, I lack no doubting prayer!"

Saint Mary shield us! Ah words of evil soul! There was a shriek--a
sob--a cry: and where was Alice of the Lea? Vanished--gone. They had
heard wild tones of sudden music in the air. There was a rush--a beam of
light--and she was gone, and that for ever! East sought they her, and
west, in northern paths and south; but she was never more seen in the
lands. Her mother wept till she had not a tear left; none sought to
comfort her, for it was vain. Moons waxed and waned, and the crones by
the cottage-hearth had whiled away many a shadowy night with tales of
Alice of the Lea.

But, at the last, as the gardener in the Pleasance leaned one day on his
spade, he saw among the roses a small round hillock of earth, such as he
had never seen before, and upon it something which shone. It was her
ring! It was the very jewel she had worn the day she vanished out of
sight! They looked earnestly upon it, and they saw within the border
(for it was wide) the tracery of certain small fine letters in the
ancient Cornish tongue, which said,--

  "Beryan Erde,
   Oyn und Perde!"

Then came the priest of the Place of Morwenna, a gray and silent man! He
had served long years at a lonely altar, a bent and solitary form. But
he had been wise in the language of his youth, and he read the legend
thus--

  "The earth must hide
  Both eyes and pride!"

Now, as he uttered these words, they stood in the Pleasance by the
mound; and on a sudden there was a low faint cry! They beheld, and O
wondrous and strange! there was a small dark creature, clothed in a soft
velvet skin, in texture and in hue like the Lady Alice her robe; and
they saw, as it went into the earth, that it moved along without eyes,
in everlasting night. Then the ancient priest wept, for he called to
mind all these things, and saw what they meant; and he showed them how
this was the maiden, who had been visited with doom for her pride.
Therefore her rich array had been changed into the skin of a creeping
thing and her large proud eyes were sealed up; and she herself had
become

  The first mole!
  Of the hillocks of Cornwall!

Ah! woe is me! and well-a-day! that damsel so stately and fair, sweet
Lady Alice of the Lea, should be made for a judgement--the dark mother
of the moles!

Now take ye good heed, Cornish maidens, how ye put on vain apparel, to
win love. And cast down your eyes, all ye damsels of the west, and look
ye meekly on the ground! Be ye good and gentle, tender and true; and
when ye see your image in the glass, and begin to be lifted up with the
beauty of that shadowy thing, call to mind the maiden of Morwenna, her
noble eyes and comely countenance, the vesture of price and the
glittering ring. Sit ye by the wheel, as of old they sate and as ye draw
the lengthening wool, sing ye ever-more and say,

  "Beryan Erde,
   Oyn and Perde!"

       *       *       *       *       *

"A whistling Wife" &c.--I can supply another version of the couplet
quoted in "Folk Lore" (Vol. ii., p. 164.), which has the merit of being
more rhymical and mysterious. In what district it was current I know
not.

  "A whistling wife and a crowing hen
   Will call the old gentleman out of his den."

G.L.B.


_A Charm for Warts._--In some parts of Ireland, especially towards the
south, they place great faith in the following charm:--When a funeral is
passing by, they rub the warts and say three times, "May these warts and
this corpse pass away and never more return;" sometimes adding, "in the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

JARLTZBERG.


_"Hanging out the Broom"._--Besides the instance given by Mr. R.F.
Johnson (Vol. i., p. 384.), perhaps some of your readers can inform me
of the origin of a somewhat similar custom, applicable to all ships and
vessels for sale or hire, by the broom (all old one being generally
used) being attached to the mast-head: if of two masts, to the
foretop-mast head.

LORD PLUNKET AND SAINT AGOBARD.

Some of your readers may remember a speech in parliament by, as I think,
Lord Plunket, in which his lordship argued with great eloquence in
behalf of the Bill for the Emancipation of the Roman Catholics. Among
many passages therein of equal truth and rhetorical power, there was one
long afterwards much quoted, paraphrased, and praised. It was that in
which he reminded the House, that those for whom he pleaded were
fellow-subjects of the same race, offspring of the same Creator, alike
believers in the One true God, the equal recipients of His mercies,
appealing for {227} His blessings though the medium of the same faith,
and looking forward for salvation to the One Intercessor, Mediator, and
Sacrifice for all,--men, who, as they did, addressed the Eternal in the
form of that "Universal prayer"--Our Father--the authority and the
privilege of one common parentage, offered by the all in the union of
the same spirit, in the conviction of the same wants, in the aspiration
of the same hope. I say, I think Lord Plunket so spoke, for I write from
memory dating from the period when George the Third was king. Now be
this so: according to the dogmas of some critics, Lord Plunket may be
convicted of an eloquent plagiary. Read the following extract from a
missive by S. Agobard, to be found in the _Bibl. Vet. Patrum_, tome
xiii, page 429., by Galland, addressed "Ad præfatum Imperatorem,
adversus legem Gundobadi et impia certamina quæ per eam geruntur," and
say whether, in spite of the separation of centuries, there does not
appear a family likeness, though there were no family acquaintance
between them; Saint Agobard being Bishop of Lyons in the ninth centry,
and Lord Plunket Attorney-General for Ireland in the nineteenth.

The Saint is pleading against the judical ordeal:

    "Illi autem profecti, prædicaverunt ubique Domino cooperante;
    annuntiataque est ab eis omni creaturæ; id est, cunetis
    nationibus mundi; una fides indita per Deum, una spes diffusa
    per Spiritum Sanctum in cordibus credentium, una caritas nata in
    omnibus, una voluntas, accensum unum desiderium, tradita una
    oratio; ut omnes omnino ex diversis gentibus, diversis
    conditionibus, diverso sexu, nobilitate, honestate, servitute
    diversa, simul dicant uni Deo, et Patri omnium; Pater Noster qui
    es, &c., sicut unum Patrem invocantes, ita unam santificationem
    quærentes, unum regnum postulantes, unam adimpletionem
    voluntatis ejus, sicut fit in coelo optantes; unum sibi panem
    quotidianum dari precantes et omnibus dimitti debita."

To which other passages might be added, as, in fact, S. Agobard pursues
the one idea until he hunts it down to the one effect of sameness and
common antithesis. Should we say Lord Plunket had read these passages,
and is thereby convicted of eloquent plagiary? I say, No! Lauder then
equally convicted Milton of trespassing on the thoughts of others, by
somewhat apposite quotations from the classics. We are, in truth, too
much inclined to this. The little, who cannot raise themselves to the
stature of the great, are apt to strive after a socialist level, by
reducing all to one same standard--their own. Truth is common to all
ages, and will obtain utterance by the truthful and the eloquent
throughout all time.

NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION OF MR. CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK OF LONDON

14. _Long Acre._ Mr. Cunningham, upon the authority of Parton's _History
of St. Giles's_, says:

    "First known as the Elms, then called Seven Acres, and since
    1612, from the length of a certain slip of ground, then first
    used as a public pathway, as Long Acre."

The latter part of this statement is incorrect. The Seven Acres were
known as _Long Acre_ as early as 1552, when they were granted to the
Earl of Bedford. See _Strype_, B. vi. p. 88.

Machyn, in his _Diary_, printed by the Camden Society, p. 21., under the
date A.D. 1556, has the following allusion to the _Acre_:

    "The vj day of December the Abbot of Westminster went a
    procession with his convent. Before him went all the Santuary
    men with crosse keys upon their garments, and after went iij for
    murder: on was the Lord Dacre's sone of the North, was wypyd
    with a shett abowt him for kyllyng of on Master West, squyre,
    dwellyng besyd ... and anodur theyff that dyd long to one of
    Master Comtroller ... dyd kylle Recherd Eggylston the
    Comtroller's tayller, and kylled him in the _Long Acurs_, the
    bak-syd Charyng Crosse."

15. _Norfolk House, St. James's Square._ The present Norfolk House was
built from a design by R. Brettingham, in 1742, by Thomas Duke of
Norfolk, and finished by his brother Edward in 1762. Mr. Cunningham
speaks as if the old house, in which George III. was born, was still
standing.

16. _Soho Square._ Mr. Cunningham has not corrected his mistake about
Mrs. Cornelys's house in this square, (see "Notes and Queries," vol. i.,
pp. 244, 450.). _D'Almaine's_, which Mr. Cunningham confounds with Mrs.
Cornelys's, was at a former period tenanted by the Duke of Argyll; then
by the Earl of Bradford; and, at a later time, by the celebrated Onslow,
who held his parliamentary levees in the principal drawing-room. The
ceilings of the best rooms are adorned with paintings by Rebecca and
Angelica Kauffman.

Mr. Cunningham has taken some pains to destroy the _Pennant_ tradition
concerning the name of this square, but he has not given us one
important piece of information, i.e. that between the years 1674 and
1681, the ground was surveyed by _Gregory King_, an eminent architect of
those days, who projected the square with the adjacent streets. Query,
Did it not take the name of _King's_ Square from the architect? This
seems very probable; more especially as the statue of Charles I. was not
placed in the square until the beginning of the next century. The centre
space was originally occupied by a splendid fountain, (the work of
Colley Cibber's father), an estimate of the "cost and charges" of which
is now before me.

Among the eminent inhabitants of this square, not noticed by Mr.
Cunningham, were the following:--Lord {228} Berkely, Lord Byron, Lord
Grimstone, Lord Howard, Lord Leicester, Sir Thomas Mansel, Lord Morpeth,
Lord Nottingham, Lord Peterborough, Lord Pierrepoint, Lord Pigot, Dudley
North, the Earl of Dartmouth, the Duchess of Cleveland, the Duchess of
Wharton, &c. These names appear in the books of the parish of St. Anne,
between the years of 1708 and 1772.

17. _Surrey Institution._ At one period (about 1825), this building was
known as the _Blackfriars Rotundo_. Here that execrable character,
Robert Taylor, who styled himself "the Devil's Chaplain," delivered his
blasphemous discourses.

18. _Opera House._ Mr. Cunningham, speaking of the translation of
_Arsinoe_, the first Anglo-Italian opera performed in this country,
says: "The translation was made by Thomas Clayton." This is an error,
for Clayton himself says, in his preface: "I was obliged to have an
Italian opera translated." Clayton was the composer of the music.

19. _James's (St.) Chapel, St. James's Palace._ Mr. Cunningham says,
"The service is chanted by the boys of the Chapel Royal." This ought to
read, "The service is chaunted by the boys _and gentlemen_ of the Chapel
Royal" The musical service of our cathedrals and collegiate
establishments cannot be performed without four kinds of voices, treble,
alto, tenor, and bass.

20. _Bagnigge Wells._ Mr. Cunningham makes a strange mistake concerning
this once popular place of amusement when he says, "first opened to the
public in the year 1767." A stone, still to be seen, let into the wall
over what was formerly the garden entrance, has the following
inscription:

  "S + T
  This is Bagnigge
  Hovse neare
  The Pinder a
  Wakefeilde
  1680."

The gardens were first opened for the accommodation of persons who
partook of the mineral springs; subsequently, amusements were added; and
in Bickham's curious work, _The Musical Entertainer_ (circa 1738), is an
engraving of Tom Hippersley mounted in the "singing rostrum," regaling
the company with a song. About half a century after this date, a regular
orchestra was erected, and the entertainments resembled Marylebone
Gardens and Vauxhall. The old house and gardens were demolished in 1842,
to make room for several new streets.

NOTES ON COLERIDGE'S AIDS TO REFLECTION

(2nd Edition, 1831)

Introductory Aphorisms, No. xii., p. 7.:

    "Tertullian had good reason for his assertation, that the
    simplest Christian (if indeed a Christian) knows more than the
    most accomplished irreligious philosopher."

The passage referred to is in the Apology, c. 46:

    "Deum quilibet opifex Christianus et invenit et ostendit et
    exinde totum, quod in Deo quæritur, re quoque assignat; licet
    Plato affirmet factitatorem universitatis neque inveniri facilem
    et inventum enarrari in omnes difficilem."

Note to Aphorism xxxi., p. 30.:

    "To which he [Plato] may possibly have referred in his phrase
    [Greek: theoparadotos sophia]."

Possibly Coleridge may have borrowed this from Berkeley's _Siris_, §
301., where [Greek: theoparadotos philosophia] is cited from "a heathen
writer." The word [Greek: theoparadotos] occurs in Proclus and Marinus
(see Valpy's _Stephani Thesaurus_), but not in Plato.

The motto from Seneca, prefixed to the Aphorisms on Spiritual Religion,
is from the fourty-first Epistle of that writer.

The question from Tertullian in the Comment on the eight of those
Aphorisms,

  "Certum est quia impossibile est."--p. 199.

is from the _De Carne Christi_, cap. v.

Aphorism iv., p. 227.:

  "In wonder all philosophy began."

See Plato's _Theætetus_ § 32., p. 155. Gataker on Antonin, i. 15.
Plutarch _de EI Delph_. cap. 2. p. 385 B. Sympos, v. 7., p. 680 C.
Aristot. _Metaph_. 1. 2. 9.

In the "Sequelæ" annexed to this Aphorism, it is said of Simonides (p.
230.), that

    "_In the fortieth day_ of his mediation the sage and philosophic
    poet abandoned the problem [of the nature of God] in despair."

Cicero (_de nat. Deor._ i. 22. § 60.) and Minucius Felix (_Octav._ 13.)
do not specify the number of days during which Simonides deferred his
answer to Hiero.

Aphorism x. On Original Sin. (note, p. 252.) [Greek: sunetois phonun],
&c., from Pindar, _Olymp._ ii. 85. (152.)

Conclusion, p. 399.:

    "_Evidences_ of Christianity! I am weary of this word," &c.

See the remarks on this passage in Archbishop Whately's _Logic_,
Appendix III., near the end.

The quotation from Apuleius, at the end of the book (p. 403.), is from
the _Metamorphos._, i. 3.

MINOR NOTES.

_Capture of Henry VI._ (Vol. ii., p. 181.).--There are several errors in
this historical note. The name of the Dean of Windsor was Manning, not
{229} "Manting;" "Brungerly" should be Bungerley. One of the Talbots, of
Bashall Hall, could never be "High Sheriff for the West Riding," as the
Ridings of Yorkshire never had distinct sheriffs; neither was he sheriff
of the county. The particulars of the king's capture are thus related in
the chronicle called Warksworth's _Chronicle_, which has been printed by
the Camden Society:--

    "Also, the same yere, kynge Henry was takene byside a howse of
    religione [i.e. Whalley] in Lancashyre, by the mene of a blacke
    monke of Abyngtone [Abingdon] in a wode called Cletherwode [the
    wood of Clitheroe], besyde Bungerly hyppyngstones, by Thomas
    Talbott, sonne and heyre to sere Edmunde Talbot of Basshalle,
    and Jhon Talbott, his cosyne, of Colebry [i.e. Salebury, in
    Blackburn], withe other moo; which discryvide [him] beynge at
    his dynere at Wadyngton halle: and [he was] carryed to London on
    horsebake, and his leges bownde to the styropes."

I have substituted the word "discryvide" for "disseyvide," as it is
printed in the Camden Society's book, where the editor, Mr. Halliwell,
understood the passage as meaning that the king was deceived or
betrayed. I take the meaning to be that the black monk of Abingdon had
descried, or discovered, the king as he was eating his dinner at
Waddington Hall; whereupon the Talbots, and some other parties in the
neighbourhood, formed plans for his apprehension, and arrested him on
the first convenient opportunity, as he was crossing the ford across the
river Ribble, formed by the hyppyngstones at Bungerley. Waddington
belonged to Sir John Tempest, of Bracewell, who was the father-in-law of
Thomas Talbot. Both Sir John Tempest and Sir James Harrington of
Brierley, near Barnsley, were concerned in the king's capture, and each
received one hundred marks reward; but the fact of Sir Thomas Talbot
being the chief actor, is shown by his having received the larger reward
of 100£. Further particulars respecting these and other parties
concerned, will be found in the notes to Warksworth's _Chronicle_. The
chief residence of the unhappy monarch during his retreat was at Bolton
Hall, where his boots, his gloves, and a spoon, are still preserved, and
are engraved in Whitaker's _Craven_. An interior view of the ancient
hall at Bolton, which is still remaining, is engraved in the
_Gentleman's Magazine_ for May, 1841. Sir Ralph Pudsay, of Bolton, had
married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Tunstal, who attended the king
as esquire of the body.

QUERIES

JOHN JOKYN, OR JOACHIM, THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR.

I am very desirous to be informed in what _French_ author I can find any
account of John Jokyn (Joachim?), who was ambassador to England from
France during the time of Cardinal Wolsey. I have looked into the
greater part of the French authors who have written historically on the
reign of François I. without having found any mention of such
personage--_L'Art de vérifier les Dates_, &c., without success. He is
frequently spoken of by English writers, and particularly in the _Union
of the Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke_, by Edward Halle, 1548, folios
135, 136, 139, 144, and 149.; at folio 144., 17th year of Hen. VIII., it
is stated:--

    "There came over as ambassador from France, Jhon Jokyn, now
    called M. de Vaux, which, as you have heard in the last year,
    was kept secret in Master Lark's house; and when he came into
    England he was welcomed of the Cardinal (Wolsey), and there
    between them were such communications at the suit of the said
    Jhon, that a truce was concluded from the 13th of July for forty
    days between England and France, both on the sea, and beyond the
    sea," &c. &c.

This M. Jokyn, or Joachim, appears to have been a person of considerable
influence, and it appears his purpose on this mission was to bribe
Wolsey; and it seems that the Chancellor Duprat was aware of this, and
was much displeased on the occasion.

SCRIPTURES, ROMAN CATHOLIC TRANSLATIONS OF, LUTHER'S FAMILIARITY WITH.

The replies I have gained to previous Queries encourage me to trouble
you with the following:--

1. Has the Roman Catholic Church ever published a translation of the
Scriptures, or any part of them, into the vernacular _Irish_? Have their
missionaries in _China_ ever translated anything beyond the Epistles and
Gospels of the Missal? Or, is there any Roman Catholic translation into
any of the vernacular languages of _India_? Or, are there any versions
in any of the American dialects by Roman Catholic authors, besides those
mentioned by Le Long in his _Bibliotheca Sacra_. And is there any
continuation of his work up to {230} the present day? I am acquainted
with Bishop Marsh's volume, but he seems ill-informed and speaks vaguely
about Roman Catholic versions.

2. What is the authority for the familiar story of a bill being brought
into parliament for the suppression of all vernacular translations in
Richard II.'s reign, and of its being stoutly opposed by John of Gaunt?
"What, are we the dregs of the earth not to hear the Scriptures in our
own tongue?" Usher mentions the circumstance (_Historia Dogmatica_,
&c.), and it is borrowed from him by Fox. But I am so ignorant as not to
know the original and cotemporary authority.

3. Your learned correspondent, DR. MAITLAND, in his _Dark Ages_, snubs
D'Aubigné most unmercifully for repeating an old story about Luther's
stumbling upon a Bible, and pooh-pooh's D'Aubigné's authority,
Mathesius, as no better than a goose. May I ask whether it is possible
to discover the probable foundation of such a story, and whether Luther
has left us in his writings any account of his early familiarity with
Scripture, that would bear upon the alleged incident, and show how much
of it may be true?

_Commoner marrying a Peeress._--Formerly, when a commoner married a
peeress in her own right, he assumed her title and dignity. The right
was, I believe, disputed during the reign of Henry VIII., in the case of
the claimant of the barony of Talbois, when it was decided that no man
could take his wife's titles unless he had issue male by her, but, if
there were such issue, he became, as in cases of landed property,
"tenant by curtesy" of her dignities. Can any of your correspondents

_Morganatic Marriages.--Morganatique._--What is the derivation of this
word, and what its _actual signification_?

In the _Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française_ (ed. 4to., 1835), the word
does not appear. In Boister's _Dictionnaire Universel_ (Bruxelles, 1835)
it is thus given:--

    "Morganatique, _adj. 2 g._, nocturne, mystérieux, entrainée par
    séduction; (mariage) mariage secret des princes d'Allemagne avec
    une personne d'un rang inférieur."

And the same definition is given by Landais (Paris, 4to., 1842), but
this does not give the derivation or literal signification of the word
"_morganatic_." It is not in Johnson's _Dictionary_; but in Smart's
_Dictionary Epitomized_ (Longman and Co., 1840) it is thus given:--

    "Morganatic, _a._, applied to the marriage in which a gift in
    the morning is to stand in lieu of dowry, or of all right of
    inheritance, that might otherwise fall to the issue."

This, however, is inconsistent with the definition of _nocturne_,
_mystérieux_, for the gift in lieu of dowry would have nothing of
mystery in it.

Will some of your correspondents afford, if they can, any reasonable
explanation which justifies the application of the word to inferior or
left-handed marriages?

REPLIES.

POETA ANGLICUS.

Every proof or disproof of statements continually made with regard to
the extravagant titles assumed, or complacently received, by the bishops
of Rome being both interesting and important, the inquiry of J.B. (Vol.
ii., p. 167.) is well deserving of a reply. Speaking of a passage cited
by Joannes Andreæ, in his gloss on the preface to the Clementines, he
asks, "who is the Anglicus Poeta?" and "what is the name of his poem,"
in which it is said to the pope, "Nec Deus es nec homo, quasi neuter es
inter utrumque?"

"Poetria nova" was the name assigned to the hexameter poem commencing,
"Papa stupor mundi," inscribed, about the year 1200, to the reigning
Pope, Innocent III., by Galfridus de Vino salvo. Of this work several
manuscript copies are to be met with in England. I will refer only to
two in the Bodleian, Laud. 850. 83.: Ken. Digb. 1665. 64. Polycarp
Leyser (_Hist. Poem. medii Ævi_) published it in 1721; and Mabillon has
set forth another performance by the same writer in elegiac verse (_Vet.
Analect._ pp. 369-76., Paris, 1723). In the latter case the author's
name is not given, and accordingly he is entered merely as "Poeta vetus"
in Mr. Dowling's _Notitia Scriptorum SS. Pat._, sc. p. 279., Oxon.,
1839. Your correspondent may compare with Andreæ's extract these lines,
and those which follow them, p. 374.:

  "Papa brevis vox est, sed virtus nominis hujus
  Perlustrat quiequid arcus uterque tenet."

Galfridus evidently derived his surname from his treatise on vines and
wine; and he has been singularly unfortunate in the epithet, for I have
never seen VIN-SAUF correctly printed. It varies from "de Nine salvo" to
"_Mestisauf_." Pits and Oudin call him "Vinesalf" and Fabricius and
Mansi change him into "Vine fauf."

The question now remains, Are the Roman Pontiffs and their Church
answerable for the toleration of such language? Uncertainty may on this
occasion be removed by our recollection of the fact, that a "Censura"
upon the glosses of the papal canon law, by Manriq, Master of the Sacred
Palace, was issued by the command of Pope Pius V. in 1572. It was
reprinted by Pappus, Argent. 1599, 12mo., and 1609, 8vo., and it
contains an order for the expurgation of the words before quoted,
together with the summary in the margin, "Papa nec Deus est nec homo,"
which appears in every old edition; for instance, in that of Paris,
1532, sig. aa. iij. So far the matter looks well, and the prospect is
not hopeless. These glosses, however, were revised by another master of
the Apostolic Palace, Sixtus Fabri, and were edited, under the sanction
of Pope Gregory XIII., in the year 1580; and from this authentic
impression the impious panegyric has not been withdrawn. The marginal
abridgment has, in compliance with Manriq's direction, been
exterminated; and this additional note has been appended as a
palliative:--

    "Hæc verba sano modo sunt accipienda: prolata enim sunt ad
    ostendendum amplissimam esse Romani Pontificis
    potestatem."--Col. 4. ed. Paris, 1585.

_Poeta Anglicus_ (Vol ii., p. 167).--I cannot answer J.B.'s Queries; but
I have fallen upon a _cross scent_, which perchance may lead to their
discovery.

1. Ioannes Pitseus, _de Scriptor. ad ann._ 1250, (_Relat. Histor. de
Rebus Anglicis_, ed. Par. 1619, p. 322.), gives the following account
"de Michaele Blaunpaino:"--

    "Michael Blaunpainus, vulgo _Magister_ cognominatus, natione
    Anglus, patria Cornubiensis, ... missus Oxonium, deinde
    Parisios, ... præ cæteris se dedidit elegantiæ linguæ Latinæ,
    fuitque inter præcipuos sui temporis _poetus_ per Angliam
    potissimum et Galliam numeratus. Hunc subinde citat Textor in
    Cornucopia sub nomine Michaelis _Anglici_.... In lucem emisit:
    Historiarum Normanniæ, librum unum: Contra Henricum Abrincensem

    Bibliotheca Lunleiana._) Epistolarum et carminum, librum unum.
    Claruit anno Messiæ 1250, sub Henrici tertii regno."

2. Valerius Andreas, however, gives a somewhat different account of
_Michael Anglicus_. In his _Biblioth. Belg._ ed. 8vo. Lovan, 1623, p.
609., he says:

    "Michael Anglicus, Bellimontensis, Hanno, I. V. Professor et
    _Poeta_, scripsit:

        Eclogarum, libros iv., ad Episc. Parisien.
        Eclogarum, libb. ii., ad Lud. Villerium.
        De mutatione studiorum, lib. i.
        Elegiam deprecatoriam.

    Et alia, quæ Paris. sunt typis edita. Hujus eruditionem et
    Poemata Bapt. Mantuanus et Joannes Ravisius Testor epigrammate
    commendarunt: hic etiam in Epithetis suis _Anglici_ auctoritatem
    non semel adducit."

3. Franciscus Sweertius (_Athenæ Belgricoe_, ed. Antv. 1628, p. 565.)
gives a similar account to this of Valerius Andreas.

4. And the account given by Christopher Hendreich Brandebargca, (ed.
Berolini, 1699, p. 193.) is substantially the same; viz.,

    "Anglicus Michael cognomine, sed natione Gallus, patria
    Belmontensis, utriusque juris Professor, scripsit Eclogarum,
    lib. iv. ad Episc." &c ... "Et diversorum carminum libros
    aliquot, quæ omnia Parisiis impressa sunt. Claruit autem A.C.
    1500."

5. Moreri takes notice of this apparent confusion made between two
different writers, who lived two centuries and a half apart. Speaking of
the later {233} of the two, he says (_Dictionnaire Historique_, Paris,
1759, tom. i. par. ii. p. 87.):--

    "_Anglicus_ (Michel), natif de Beaumont dans le Hainaut, qui
    vivoit dans le XVI. siècle, étoit poëte et professeur en droit.
    Nous avons divers ouvrages de sa façon, des églogues, un traité
    _de mutatione studiorum_, &c. (Valer. Andreas, _Bibl. Belg._)
    Quelques auteurs l'ont confondu avec Michel Blaumpain. (Voyez
    Blaumpain.)" #/

Of the earlier Anglicus, Moreri says (ubi sup., tom. ii. par. i. p.
506.):

    "Blaumpain (Michel) surnommé _Magister_, Anglois de nation, et
    _Poëte_, qui vivoit vers l'an 1250. Il est nommé par quelques-un
    _Michel Anglicus_. Mais il y a plus d'apparence que c'étoient
    deux auteurs différens; dont l'un composa une histoire de
    Normandie, et un traité contre Henri d'Avranches; et l'autre
    laissa quelques pièces de poësies;--Eclogarum, libri iv., ad
    Episcopum Parisiensem; Eclogarum, libri ii., ad Ludovicum
    Villerium, De mutatione studioram, Elogia deprecatoria, &c.
    Baptiste Mantuan parle de Michel Anglicus, qui étoit de Beaumont
    dans l'Hainault. (Pitseus, _De Script. Angl._ p. 322.; Valerius
    Andreas in _Bibl_, p. 670.)"

Perhaps some of your readers may have access to a copy of the _Paris
impression_ of Michael Anglicus, mentioned by Andreas, Sweertius, and
Hendreich. J.B. will not need to be reminded of these words of Innocent
III., in his first serm. de consecr. Pont. Max., in which he claimed, as
St. Peter's successor, to be

    "Inter Deum et hominem medius constitutus; citra Deum, sed ultra
    hominem; minor Deo, sed major homine: qui de omnibus judicat, et
    a nemine judicatur."--_Innocentii tertii Op._, ed. Colon. 1575,
    tom. i., p. 189.

Did the claim _originate_ with Pope Innocent?

CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.

I must protest against the manner in which Arun (Vol. ii., p. 187.) has
proceeded with the discussion of Caxton's printing at Westminster.
Though writing anonymously himself, he has not hesitated to charge me by
name with a desire to impeach the accuracy of Mr. C. Knight's _Life of
Caxton_, of which, and of other works of the same series, he then
volunteers as the champion, as if they, or any one of them, were the
object of a general attack. This is especially unfair, as I made the
slightest possible allusion to Mr. Knight's work, and may confess I have
as yet seen no more of it than the passage quoted by ARUN himself. Any
such admixture of personal imputations is decidedly to be deprecated, as
being likely to militate against the sober investigation of truth which
has hitherto characterised the pages of "NOTES AND QUERIES." ARUN also
chooses to say that the only question which is material, is, Who was
Caxton's patron? i.e. who was the Abbot of Westminster at the time,--who
may not, after all, have actively interfered in the matter. This
question remains in some doubt; but it was not the question with which
DR. RIMBAULT commenced the discussion. The object of that gentleman's
inquiry (Vol. ii., p. 99.) was, the particular spot where Caxton's press
was fixed. From a misapprehension of the passage in Stow, a current
opinion has obtained that the first English press was erected within the
abbey-church, and in the chapel of St. Anne; and Dr. Dibdin conjectured
that the chapel of St. Anne stood on the site of Henry VII.'s chapel.
The correction of this vulgar error is, I submit, by no means
immaterial; especially at a time when a great effort is made to
propagate it by the publication of a print, representing "William Caxton
examining the first proof sheet from his printing-press in Westminster
Abbey;" the engraving of which is to be "of the size of the favourite
print of Bolton Abbey:" where the draftsman has deliberately represented
the printers at work within the consecrated walls of the church itself!
When a less careless reader than Dr. Dibdin consults the passage of
Stow, he finds that the chapel of St. Anne stood in the opposite
direction from the church to the site of Henry VII.'s chapel, i.e.
within the court of the Almonry; and that Caxton's press was also set up
in the Almonry, though not (so far as appears, or is probable) within
that chapel. The second question is, When did Caxton first set up his
press in this place? And the third, the answer to which depends on the
preceding, is, Who was the abbot who gave him admission? Now it is true,
as ARUN remarks, that the introduction of Abbot Islip's name is traced
up to Stow in the year 1603: and, as Mr. Knight has observed, "the
careful historian of London here committed one error," because John
Islip did not become Abbot of Westminster until 1500. The entire passage
of Stow has been quoted by DR. RIMBAULT in "NOTES AND QUERIES," Vol.
ii., p. 99.; it states that in the Almonry--

    "Islip, abbot of Westminster, erected the first press of
    book-printing that ever was in England, about the year 1471."

Now, it appears that the various authors of repute, who have given the
point their consideration, as the editor of Dugdale's _Monasticon_ (Sir
Henry Ellis), and Mr. Cunningham in his _Handbook_, affirm that it is
John Esteney who became abbot in 1474 or 1475, and not Thomas Milling,
who was abbot in 1471, whose name should be substituted for that of
Islip. In that case, Stowe committed two errors instead of one; he was
wrong in his date as well as his name. It is to this point that I
directed my remarks, which are printed in Vol. ii., p. 142. We have
hitherto no evidence that Caxton {234} printed at Westminster before the
year 1477, six years later than mentioned by Stow.

THE USE OF COFFINS.

The Query of H.E. (Vol. i., p. 321.) seems to infer that the use of
coffins may be only a modern custom. In book xxiii., chapters i. and
ii., of Bingham's _Antiquities of the Christian Church_, H.E. will find
ample proof of the very early use of coffins. During the first three
centuries of the Church, one great distinction betwixt Heathens and
Christians was, that the former burned their dead, and placed the bones
and ashes in urns; whilst the latter always buried the corpse, either in
a coffin or, embalmed, in a catacomb; so that it might be restored at
the last day from its original dust. There have frequently been dug out
of the barrows which contain Roman urns, ancient British stone coffins.
Bede mentions that the Saxons buried their dead in wood. Coffins both of
lead and iron were constructed at a very early period. When the royal
vaults at St. Denis were desecrated, during the first French revolution,
coffins were exposed that had lain there for ages.

Notwithstanding all this, it appears to be the case that, both in the
Norman and English periods, the common people of this country were often
wrapped in a sere-cloth after death, and so placed, coffinless, in the
earth. The illuminations in the old missals represent this. And it is
not impossible that the extract from the "Table of Dutyes," on which
H.E. founds his inquiry, may refer to a lingering continuance of this
rude custom. Indeed, a statute passed in 1678, ordering that all dead
bodies shall be interred in woollen and no other material, is so worded
as to give the idea that there might be interments without coffins. The
statute forbids that any person be put in, wrapt, or wound up, or buried
in any shirt, shift, sheet, or shroud, unless made of sheep's wool only;
or in any coffin lined or faced with any material but sheep's wool; as
if the person might be buried either in a garment, or in a coffin, so
long as the former was made of, or the latter lined with, wool.

I think the "buryall without a coffin," quoted by H.E., must have
referred to the interment of the poorest class. Their friends, being
unable to provide a coffin, conformed to an old rude custom, which had
not entirely ceased.

SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF THE WORD "DELIGHTED".

If the passage from _Measure for Measure_, which has been the subject of
much controversy in your recent numbers, be read in its natural
sense--there is surely nothing unintelligible in the word "delighted" as
there used.

The object of the poet was to show how instinctively the mind shudders
at the change produced by death--both on body and soul; and how
repulsive it must be to an active and sentient being.

He therefore places in frightful contrast the condition of _each_ before
and after that awful change. The BODY, _now_ endowed with "sensible warm
motion," to become in death "a kneaded clod," to "lie in cold
obstruction, and to rot." The SPIRIT, _now_ "delighted" (all full of
delight), to become in death utterly powerless, an unconscious--passive
thing--"imprisoned in the viewless winds, and blown with restless
violence round about the pendant world," how intolerable the thought,
and how repulsive the contrast! It is _not_ in its state _after death_,
but _during life_, that the poet represents the spirit to be a
"delighted one." If we fall into the error of supposing him to refer to
the _former_ period, we are compelled to alter our text, in order to
make the passage intelligible, or invent some new meaning to the word
"delighted," and, at the same time, we deprive the passage of the strong
antithesis in which all its spirit and force consists. It is this strong
antithesis, this painfully marked contrast between the two states of
_each, body_ and _spirit_, which displays the power and skill of the
poet in handling the subject. Without it, the passage loses half its
meaning.

MR. HICKSON will not, I hope, accuse one who is no critic for presuming
to offer this suggestion. I tender it with diffidence, being conscious
that, although a passionate admirer of the great bard, I am all
unlearned in the art of criticism, "a plain unlettered man," and
therefore simply take what is set before me in its natural sense, as
well as I may, without searching for recondite interpretations. On this
account, I feel doubly the necessity of apologising for interfering with
the labours of so learned and able a commentator as MR. HICKSON has
shown himself to be.

VENTRILOQUISM

(Vol. ii., p. 88.)

Plutarch (tom. ii., p. 397.D.) has these words:

    [Greek: "Ou gar esti theou hae gaerus oude ho phthoggos, oude he
    lexis, oude to metron, alla taes yunaikos: ekeinos de monas tas
    phantasias paristaesi, kau phos en tae psuchae poiei pros to
    mellon."]

If that be the passage referred to be Rollin, nothing is said there
about ventriloquism. The Scholiast on Aristoph. (_Plut._ 39.) tells us
how the Pythian received the _afflatus_, but says nothing about her
_speaking_ from her belly: He only has

    [Greek: "Ta taes manteias hae mallon manias ephtheggeto
    hraemata."]

In another place of Plutarch (tom. ii., p. 414. E.) we have [Greek:
eggastrimuthoi] and [Greek: puthones] used as synonymous words to
express persons into whose bodies the god might be supposed to enter,
"using their {235} bodies and voices as instruments." The only word in
that passage which appears to hint at what we call ventriloquism is
[Greek: hupophtheggesthai].

I have very little doubt that amongst the various tricks of ancient
divination ventriloquism found a place; but I cannot give that direct
evidence which MR. SANSOM asks for. I think it very likely that "_the
wizards that peep and mutter_" (Isa. viii. 19.) were of this class; but
it is not clear that the [Hebrew: 'obot]--the [Greek eggastrimuthoi] of
the LXX.--were so. The English version has "them that have familiar
spirits." The Hebrew word signifies _bottles_; and this may mean no more
than that the spirit of divination was contained in the person's body as
in a bottle, "using his body and his voice as instruments," as in the
place of Plutarch quoted above. We have something like this, Acts, xix.
15., where "the evil spirit answered," no doubt in the voice of the
demoniac, "Jesus I know," &c. Michaelis (Suppl., p. 39.) gives a
different meaning and etymology to [Hebrew: 'obot]. He derives it from
the Arabic, which signifies (1) _rediit_, (2) _occidit_ sol, (3) _noctu
venit_ or _noctu aliquid fecit_. The first and third of these meanings
will make it applicable to the [Greek: nekromanteia] (of which the witch
of Endor was a practitioner), which was carried on at night. See Hor.
_Sat._ I. ix.

I do not think that the damsel mentioned Acts, xvi. 16. was a
ventriloquist. The use of the word [Greek: ekraze] in the next verse,
would lead us to infer that she spoke in a loud voice _with her mouth
open_; whereas the [Greek: eggastrimuthoi] are defined by Galen
(_Glossar. Hippocr._) as [Greek: oi kekleismenou tou stomatos
phthengomenoi].

Consult Vitringa and Rosenmüller on Isa. viii. 19., Wolf and Kuinoel on
Acts, xvi. 16., Biscoe on the Acts, ch. viii. §2; where references will
be found to many works which will satisfy Mr. SANSOM better than this
meagre note.

_Ventriloquism_ (Vol. ii., p. 88.).--In reply to Query 1, I wish to call
Mr. SANSOM'S attention to _Plutarch de Oraculorum defectu_ (Lipsiæ,

Witchcraft_ (chaps. vi. and viii.). Queries 2 and 3. Besides the
extraordinary work of Webster, he may consult the elaborate
dissertations of Allatius on these subjects, in the eighth volume of
_Critici Sacri_. Query 4. On the use of the term [Greek: eggastrimuthos]

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

_Earl of Oxford's Patent_ (Vol. ii., p. 194.).--M.'s quotation from the
_Weekly Oracle_ relates to Harley's having been stabbed at the
council-table by the Sieur de Guiscard, a French Papist, brought up for
examination 8th March, 1711. The escape of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer was the subject of an address from both Houses to the Queen;
and upon his being sufficiently recovered to resume his seat, the
Speaker delivered to him the unanimous congratulations of the House of
Commons. Harley was shortly after created Earl of Oxford, by patent
bearing date 24th May, 1711, which recites, _inter alia_,--

    "Since, therefore, the two Houses of Parliament have declared
    that the fidelity and affection he has expressed in our service
    have exposed him to the hatred of wicked men, _and the desperate
    rage of a villanous parricide_, since they have congratulated
    his escape from such imminent dangers, and put us in mind that
    he might not be preserved in vain, we willingly comply with
    their desires, and grant him who comes so honourably recommended
    by the votes of our Parliament, a place among our peer," &c.
    &c.--Collin's _Peerage_, vol. iv. p. 260. edit. 1789.

Guiscard died in Newgate of the wounds which he received in the scuffle
when he was secured.

BRAYBROOKE.

    [O.P.Q., who has kindly replied to M.'s inquiry, has appended to
    his answer the following Query:--"Is Smollett justified in using
    the words _assassin_ and _assassinate_, as applied to cases of
    intended homicide, when death did not ensue?"]


_The Darby Ram_ (Vol. ii., p. 71.).--There is a whimsical little volume,
which, as it relates mainly to local matters, may not have come under
the notice of many of your readers, to which I would refer your querist
H.W.

It is entitled,--

    "Gimcrackiana, or Fugitive Pieces on Manchester Men and Manners
    ten years ago. Manchester, 1833." cr. 8vo.

It is anonymous, but I believe truly ascribed to a clever young
bookseller of the name of J.S. Gregson, since dead.

At page 185. he gives twelve stanzas of this ballad, as the most perfect
copy from the oral chronicle of his greatgrandmother.

In _The Ballad Book_ (Edinb. 1827, 12mo.), there is another entitled
"The Ram of Diram," of a similar kind, but consisting of only six verses
and chorus. And the _Dublin Penny Journal_, vol. i., p. 283., contains a
prose story, entitled "Darby and the Ram," of the same veracious nature.

F.R.A.


_Rotten Row and Stockwell Street._--R.R., of Glasgow, inquires the
etymology of these names (Vol. i., p. 441.). The etymology of the first
word possesses some interest, perhaps, at the present time, owing to the
name of the site of the intended Exhibition from all Nations in Hyde
Park. I sent to the publishers of _Glasgow Delineated_, {236} which was
printed at the University press in 1826, a contradiction of the usual
origin of the name adopted in that city, showing the impossibility of
the expression bearing any reference to the dissoluteness or immorality
of the former residents, and also contradicting its having any thing to
do with "rats," or "rattons," _Scotticè_; although, in 1458, the "Vicus
Rattonum" is the term actually used in the Archbishop of Glasgow's
chartulary. My observations, which were published in a note, concluded
as follows:

    "The name, however, may be also traced to a very remote and
    classic origin, although we are not aware that it has hitherto
    been condescended on. In ancient Rome was what was called the
    Ratumena Porta, 'a nomine ejus appellata (says Gessner in his
    Latin _Thesaurus_) qui ludiero certamine quadrigis victor
    juvenis Veiis consternatis equis excussus Romæ periit, qui equi
    feruntur non ante constitisse quam pervenirent in Capitolium.'
    The same story is related by Pliny, from whom and other authors,
    it appears that the word Ratumena was then as proverbially
    applied to jockies as Jehu in our own days. From the
    circumstance of the Rotten Row Port (of Glasgow) having stood at
    the west end of this street, and the Stable Green Port near the
    east end, which also led to the Archbishop's castle, it is
    probably not only that it was the street through which
    processions would generally proceed, but that the port alluded
    to, and after it the street in question, were dignified by the
    more learned of our ancestors with the Roman name of which, or
    of the Latin Rota, the present appears a very natural
    corruption."

I may here refer to Facciolati's _Dictionary, voce_ "Ratumena Porta," as
well as Gessner's.

As to _Stockwell_, also a common name, it is obviously indicative of the
particular kind of well at the street, by which the water was lifted not
by a wheel, nor by a pump, nor a pulley, but by a beam poised on or
formed by a large _stock_, or _block of wood_.

hornbooks, with a woodcut of one of the time of Queen Elizabeth, in Mr.

_Passages from Shakspeare_ (Vol. ii., p. 135.).--

  _Ang._ We are all frail.

  _Isab._ Else let my brother die,
  If not a feodary, but only he
  Owe, and succeed thy weakness.

  _Ang._ Nay, women are frail too.

  _Measure for Measure_, Act. ii. Sc. 4.

I should paraphrase Isabella's remarks thus:--

    "If it be otherwise, if we are not all frail as thou sayest,
    then let my brother die, unless he be but in the same case as
    others; if he alone possess and follow thee in that particular
    frailty to which thou has half confessed."

A feodary, I should observe, was an officer of the Court of Wards, who
was joined with the escheator and did not act singly; I conceive
therefore that Shakspeare by this expression indicates an associate; one
in the same plight as others; negatively, one who does not stand alone.
In _Cymbeline_, Act iii. Sc. 2., we read:

  "Senseless bauble,
  Art thou a _feodary_ for this act, and lookst
  So virgin-like without?"

where feodary clearly means confederate, associate. According to some,
the word signifies one who holds land by the same tenure as the rest of
mankind; whilst Mr. Knight, in a note on _Henry IV_. Part i. Act i.
endeavors to show that it includes both the companion and the feudal
vassal.

"To owe" is frequently used by Shakspeare in the sense of to possess, to
own, as in Act i. Sc. 5. where Lucio says:

  "But when they weep and kneel,
  All their petitions are as freely theirs
  As they themselves would _owe_ them."

So also in the following instances:--

  "The slaughter of the prince that _ow'd_ that crown."

  _Richard III._, Act. iv. Sc. 4.

  "What art thou, that keepst me out from the house I
  _owe_?"

  _Comedy of Errors_, Act iii. Sc. 1.

  "Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst _owe_."

  _Sonnet_ lxx.

Further examples will be found in _A Lover's Complaint_, the last line
but two; _Pericles_, Act v. Sc. 1.; _Twelfth Night_, Act. i Sc. 5.,
_Love's Labour's Lost_, Act i. Sc. 2.; _King John_, Act ii. Sc. 1.;
_King Lear_, Act i. Sc. 4.

As the passage is allowed to be obscure, this attempt to explain its
meaning is submitted with great deference to the opinions of your
readers.

_Mildew in Books_ (Vol. ii., p. 103.).--In answer to B. I mention that
the following facts connected with mildew in books have been elicited.

The mildew referred to is that which shows itself in the form of
roundish or irregular brown spots.

It is usually most abundant in those parts which are most exposed to the
air.

In making a microscopic examination of the spots, I ascertained that
there was no new structure present; but in manipulating I found that
these spots absorbed water more rapidly than the rest of the paper.

On applying litmus, these spots were found to have a powerful acid
reaction.

On submitting the matter to a chemical friend, he ascertained that the
acid in question was the sulphuric, or oil of vitriol. Experiments were
then made with a dilute solution of this acid on {237} clean paper, and
spots were produced similar to those of mildew.

The acid does not naturally exist in paper, and its presence can only be
accounted for by supposing that the paper has been bleached by the fumes
of sulphur. This produces sulphurous acid, which, by the influence of
atmospheric air and moisture, is slowly converted into sulphuric, and
then produces the mildew. As this may be shown to be an absolute
_charring_ of the fibres of which the paper is composed, it is to be
feared that it cannot be cured. After the process has once commenced, it
can only be checked by the utmost attention to dryness, moisture being
indispensable to its extension, and vice versâ.

I do not know whether these facts are generally known, but they would
seem to be very important to paper-makers.

_Pilgrims' Road to Canterbury_ (Vol. ii., p. 199.).--Your correspondent
PHILO-CHAUCER, I presume, desires to know the old route to Canterbury. I
should imagine that at the time of Chaucer a great part of the country
was uncultivated and uninclosed, and a horse-track in parts of the route
was probably the nearest approximation to a road. At the present day,
crossing the London road at Wrotham, and skirting the base of the chalk
hills, there is a narrow lane which I have heard _called_ "the Pilgrims'
road," and this, I suppose, is in fact the old Canterbury road; though
how near to London or Canterbury it has a distinct existence, and to
what extent it may have been absorbed in other roads, I am not able to
say. The title of "Pilgrims' road" I take to be a piece of modern
antiquarianism. In the immediate vicinity of this portion there are some
druidical remains: some at Addington, and a portion of a small circle
tolerably distinct in a field and lane between, I think, Trottescliffe
and Ryarsh. In the absence of better information, you may perhaps make
use of this.

_Etymology of Totnes._--The Query of J.M.B. (Vol. i., p 470.) not having
been as yet answered, I venture to offer a few notes on the subject;
and, mindful of your exhortation to brevity, compress my remarks into
the smallest possible compass, though the details of research which
might be indulged in, would call for a dissertation rather them a Note.

That Totnes is a place of extreme antiquity as a British town cannot be
doubted; first, from the site and character of its venerable hill
fortress; secondly, from the fact that the chief of the four great
British and Roman roads, the Fosse-way, commenced there--"The ferthe of
thisse is most of alle that tilleth from Toteneis ... From the
south-west to north-east into Englonde's end;" and, thirdly, from the
mention of it, and the antiquity assigned to it by our earliest annals
and chronicles. Without entering into the question of the full
authenticity of Brute and the _Saxon Chronicle_, or the implicit
adoption of the legendry tales of Havillan and Geoffry of Monmouth, the
concurring testimony of those records, with the voice of tradition, the
stone of the landing, and the fact that the town is seated at the head
of an estuary the most accessible, the most sheltered, and the best
suited of any on the south-western coast for the invasion of such a
class of vessels as were those of the early navigators, abundantly
warrant the admission that it was the landing-place of some mighty
leader at a very early period of our history.

And now to the point of the etymology of _Totenais_, as it stands in
Domesday Book. We may, I think, safely dismiss the derivation suggested
by Westcote, on the authority of Leland, and every thing like it derived
from the French, as well as the unknown tongue which he adopts in
"Dodonesse." That we are warranted in seeking to the Anglo-Saxon for
etymology in this instance is shown by the fact, that the names of
places in Devon are very generally derived from that language; e.g.
taking a few only in the neighbourhood of Totnes--Berry, Buckyatt,
Dartington, Halwell, Harberton, Hamstead, Hempstin, Stancombe.

First, of the termination _ais_ or _eis_. The names of many places of
inferior consequence in Devon end in _hays_, from the Ang.-Saxon _heag_,
a hedge or inclosure; but this rarely, if ever, designates a town or a
place beyond a farmstead, and seems to have been of later application as
to a new location or subinfeudation; for it is never found in Domesday
Book. In that ancient record the word _aisse_ is often found alone, and
often as a prefix and as a terminal; e.g., Aisbertone, Niresse,
Aisseford, Aisselie, &c. This is the Ang.-Saxon _Aesc_, an ash; and it
is uniformly so rendered in English: but it also means a ship or boat,
as built of ash. _Toten_, the major of the name, is, I have no doubt,
the genitive of _Tohta_, "dux, herzog," a leader or commander. Thus we
have _Tohtanoesc_, the vessel of the leader, or the commander's
ship,--commemorating the fact that the boat of some great invader was
brought to land at this place.

_Ædricus qui Signa fundebat_ (Vol. ii., p. 199), must surely have been a

_Fiz-gig_ (Vol. ii, p. 120).--I had expected that your Querist C.B.
would have received an {238} immediate reply to his Query as to the
meaning of _fiz-gig_, because the word is in Johnson's _Dictionary_,
where he may also see the line from Sandys' _Job_, in which it caught
his attention.

You may as well, therefore, tell him two things,--that _fiz-gig_ means a
fish-cart and that Querists should abstain from soliciting your aid in
all cases where a common dictionary would give them the information they
want.

_Guineas_ (Vol. ii., p. 10.).--The coin named in the document quoted by
A.J.H. is the _Guiennois_ a gold piece struck at Guienne by Edward III.,
and also by his son the Black Prince. It is not likely that the
Guiennois was the original of the name given to the new gold coin of
Charles II., because it could have had no claim to preference beyond the
_Mouton_, the _Chaise_, the _Pavillon_, or any other old Anglo-Gallic
coin. I think we may rest contented with the statement of Leake (who
wrote not much more than half a century after the event), and who says
that the _Guinea_ was so called from the gold of which it was made
having been brought from Guinea by the African Company, whose stamp of
an elephant was ordered to be impressed upon it.

J.C. Witton.


_Numismatics._--My thanks are due to Mr. J.C. Witton (Vol. ii., p. 42.)
for his replies to my Numismatic Queries, though I cannot coincide with
his opinion on Nos. 1. and 3.

No ancient forger would have taken the pains to cut a die to strike lead
from; and my specimen, from its sharpness, has clearly never been in
circulation: why may it not have been a proof from the original die?

Of No. 2. I have since been shown several specimens, which had before, I
suppose, escaped my notice.

On the coin of Macrinus, the letter below the S.C. now clearly appears
to be an [Greek: eta], but the one above is not a [Greek: Delta], but
rather an L or inverted T. It cannot stand for [Greek: Lykabas], as on
the Egyptian coinage, as Macrinus was slain by his soldiers the year
after his accession.

The Etruscilla, even under a powerful magnifier, betrays no trace of
ever having been plated and has all the marks by which numismatists
determine the genuineness of a coin. The absence of S.C., I must remind
Mr. W., is not uncommon on _third_ brass, though of course it always
appears on the first and second.

I need go no farther than the one just mentioned of Tiberius, which has
no S.C., and I possess several others which are deficient in this
particular, a Severus Alexander, Elagabalus, &c. After Gallienus it
never appears.

_Querela Cantabrigiensis_ (Vol. ii, p. 168.).--Dr. Peter Barwick, in the

after describing the treatment of the University by Cromwell, adds (p.
32.) "But Mr. Barwick, no inconsiderable part of this tragedy, together
with others of the University, groaning under the same yoke of tyranny,
and each taking a particular account of the sufferings of his own
college, gave a distinct narrative of all these barbarities, and under
the title of _Querela Cantabrigiensis_, or the _University of
Cambridge's Complaint_, got it printed by the care of Mr. R---- B----,
bookseller of _London_ who did great service to his King and country, by
printing, and dispersing in the most difficult times, books written in
defence of the royal cause." See also _Biog. Brit._, article "Barwick".

_Ben Johnson_ (Vol. ii., p. 167.)--So the name was spelt by most of his
contemporaries. The poem mentioned by N.A.B. is printed in the
_Underwoods_, Gifford's edition, ix., 68; but the MS. may contain
variations worthy of notice. I should doubt its being autograph, not
merely because the poet spelt his name without the _h_, but because the
verses in question are only part of his _Eupheme_.

_Barclay's "Argenis"._--Since I sent you a Query on this subject, I have

believe, by a translation of this work, which she published in 1772,
under the title of _The Phoenix_.

174.) in which, alluding to that day, he says,

    "The boys at Olney have likewise a very entertaining sport which
    commences annually upon this day; they call it _hockey_, and it
    consists in dashing each other with mud, and the windows also,

Praed, now first collected by Rufus W. Griswold; New York_, 1844. This

MISCELLANEOUS

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

We announced, after the last Annual Meetings of the Shakspeare Society,
that it had been determined to publish a complete set of the Plays of
one of Shakspeare's most prolific and interesting contemporaries, Thomas
Heywood; and that the first volume of such collection, containing Six
Plays, was then ready. A further contribution towards this collection,
containing _The Royal King and Loyal Subject_, which has not been
reprinted since the old edition of 1637, and his very popular drama, _A
Woman killed with Kindness_, has just been issued, with an Introduction
and Notes by J. Payne Collier, Esq., the zealous and indefatigable
Director of the Society, and will, we are sure, be welcomed by every
lover of our early drama. The Shakspeare Society will, indeed, do good
service to the cause of our early literature if it prove the means of
securing us, a uniform series of the works of such of our Elizabethan
dramatists as do not stand sufficiently high in the opinion of the
uninitiated, to tempt the publishing world to put forth their
productions in a collected form.

"A better or more valuable work for country book societies, lending

sound in principle, and its criticisms liberal but just; whilst its
Obituary confers upon it a national importance. We are sure then we
cannot do a better service to our friends, and more especially to those
connected with institutions like those we have adverted to, than in
recommending this work to their support."--_Nottingham Review_.

BUILDING FOR THE EXHIBITION OF INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS, 1851.

THE ATHENÆUM

Of Saturday, August 31st, contains a perspective view of Mr. Paxton's
design for the building as finally approved by Her Majesty's
Commissioners, and now in course of erection in Hyde Park. The Athenæum
of Saturday, the 7th of September, will contain a view of the south
front, a view of the east front, a portion on an enlarged scale, and a
ground plan.

Several journals having published views of a building which it was
supposed would be the building erected, the publisher of The Athenæum
considers it proper to state that the views announced above have never
been seen by the public, and are totally dissimilar to those engraved in
the professional journals.

The Athenæum is published every Saturday, and may be had, by order, of
any Bookseller, price 4d., or stamped to pass free by post, 5d.; and
contains,

Reviews, with extracts, of every important new English book, and of the
more important foreign.

Reports of the learned and scientific societies, with abstracts of all
papers of interest.

Authentic Accounts of all scientific voyages and expeditions.

Criticisms on Art, with critical notices of exhibitions, picture
collections, new prints, &c.

Foreign Correspondence on literature, science, and art.

Music and Drama, including reports on the opera, concerts, theatres, new
music, &c.

Biographical Notices of men distinguished in literature, science, and
art.

Original Papers and Poems.

Miscellanea, including all that is likely to interest the informed and
intelligent.

The Athenæum is so conducted that the reader, however far distant, is,
in respect to literature, science, and the arts, on an equality, in
point of information, with the best-informed circles of the metropolis.

The publisher will on this occasion send a single copy on receipt of
five postage stamps.

TESTIMONIAL TO DR. CONOLLY.--At a meeting held at 12. Old Burlington
Street, Saturday, August 3d. 1850, the Right Hon. Lord Ashley in the
chair; the following resolutions among others were unanimously agreed
to:

That Dr. JOHN CONOLLY, of Hanwell, is, in the opinion of this meeting,
eminently entitled to some public mark of esteem and gratitude, for his
long, zealous, disinterested, and most successful labours in
ameliorating the treatment of the insane.

That a committee be now formed, for the purpose of carrying into effect
the foregoing Resolution, by making the requisite arrangements for the
presentation to Dr. Conolly of _A Public Testimonial_, commemorative of
his invaluable services in the cause of humanity, and expressive of the
just appreciation of those services by his numerous friends and
admirers, and by the public generally.

THE COMMITTEE subsequently resolved:

That in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate Testimonial
will be a PORTRAIT of Dr. CONOLLY (for which he is requested to sit), to
be presented to his family, and an ENGRAVING of the same, to be
presented to the subscribers; and that the ultimate arrangement of this
latter point be made at a future meeting of the committee.

It has been determined that the individual subscriptions shall be
limited to Five Guineas; that subscribers of Two Guineas and upwards
shall receive a proof impression of the Engraving; and subscribers of
One Guinea, a print.

It is also proposed to present Dr. CONOLLY with a piece of plate, should
the funds permit after defraying the expenses of the painting and
engraving.

Subscribers' names and subscriptions will be received by the
secretaries, at 12. Old Burlington Street, and 4. Burlington Gardens,
and by the Treasurers, at the Union Bank, Regent Street Branch, Argyll
Place, London. Post-office Orders should be made payable at the
Post-office _Piccadilly_, to one of the Secretaries.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
