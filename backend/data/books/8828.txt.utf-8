Book 40 Matthew

001:001 The Genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

001:002 Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac of Jacob; Jacob of Judah
        and his brothers.

001:003 Judah was the father (by Tamar) of Perez and Zerah; Perez
        of Hezron; Hezron of Ram;

001:004 Ram of Amminadab; Amminadab of Nahshon; Nahshon of Salmon;

001:005 Salmon (by Rahab) of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth) of Obed; Obed of Jesse;

001:006 Jesse of David--the King.  David (by Uriah's widow)
        was the father of Solomon;

001:007 Solomon of Rehoboam; Rehoboam of Abijah; Abijah of Asa;

001:008 Asa of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat of Jehoram; Jehoram of Uzziah;

001:009 Uzziah of Jotham; Jotham of Ahaz; Ahaz of Hezekiah;

001:010 Hezekiah of Manasseh; Manasseh of Amon; Amon of Josiah;

001:011 Josiah of Jeconiah and his brothers at the period of the
        Removal to Babylon.

001:012 After the Removal to Babylon Jeconiah had a son Shealtiel; Shealtiel
        was the father of Zerubbabel;

001:013 Zerubbabel of Abiud; Abiud of Eliakim; Eliakim of Azor;

001:014 Azor of Zadok; Zadok of Achim; Achim of Eliud;

001:015 Eliud of Eleazar; Eleazar of Matthan; Matthan of Jacob;

001:016 and Jacob of Joseph the husband of Mary, who was the mother
        of JESUS who is called CHRIST.

001:017 There are therefore, in all, fourteen generations from Abraham
        to David; fourteen from David to the Removal to Babylon;
        and fourteen from the Removal to Babylon to the Christ.

001:018 The circumstances of the birth of Jesus Christ were these.
        After his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they
        were united in marriage, she was found to be with child
        through the Holy Spirit.

001:019 But Joseph her husband, being a kind-hearted man and unwilling
        publicly to disgrace her, had determined to release her
        privately from the betrothal.

001:020 But while he was contemplating this step, an angel of the Lord
        appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David,
        do not be afraid to bring home your wife Mary, for she is
        with child through the Holy Spirit.

001:021 She will give birth to a Son, and you are to call His name
        JESUS for He it is who will save His People from their sins."

001:022 All this took place in fulfilment of what the Lord had spoken
        through the Prophet,

001:023 "Mark!  The maiden will be with child and will give birth to a son,
        and they will call His name Immanuel"--a word which signifies
        `God with us'.

001:024 When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded,
        and brought home his wife,

001:025 but did not live with her until she had given birth to a son.
        The child's name he called JESUS.

002:001 Now after the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem
        in Judaea in the reign of King Herod, excitement was produced
        in Jerusalem by the arrival of certain Magi from the east,

002:002 inquiring, "Where is the newly born king of the Jews?  For we
        have seen his Star in the east, and have come here to
        do him homage."

002:003 Reports of this soon reached the king, and greatly agitated
        not only him but all the people of Jerusalem.

002:004 So he assembled all the High Priests and Scribes of the people,
        and anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born.

002:005 "At Bethlehem in Judaea," they replied; "for so it stands
        written in the words of the Prophet,

002:006 "`And thou, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, by no means the least
        honorable art thou among princely places in Judah!  For from
        thee shall come a prince--one who shall be the Shepherd
        of My People Israel.'"

002:007 Thereupon Herod sent privately for the Magi and ascertained
        from them the exact time of the star's appearing.

002:008 He then directed them to go to Bethlehem, adding, "Go and make
        careful inquiry about the child, and when you have found him,
        bring me word, that I too may come and do him homage."

002:009 After hearing what the king said, they went to Bethlehem, while,
        strange to say, the star they had seen in the east led them
        on until it came and stood over the place where the babe was.

002:010 When they saw the star, the sight filled them with intense joy.

002:011 So they entered the house; and when they saw the babe with His
        mother Mary, they prostrated themselves and did Him homage,
        and opening their treasure-chests offered gifts to Him--
        gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

002:012 But being forbidden by God in a dream to return to Herod,
        they went back to their own country by a different route.

002:013 When they were gone, and angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
        in a dream and said, "Rise: take the babe and His mother
        and escape to Egypt, and remain there till I bring you word.
        For Herod is about to make search for the child in order
        to destroy Him."

002:014 So Joseph roused himself and took the babe and His mother
        by night and departed into Egypt.

002:015 There he remained till Herod's death, that what the Lord had
        said through the Prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I
        called My Son."

002:016 Then Herod, finding that the Magi had trifled with him, was furious,
        and sent and massacred all the boys under two years of age,
        in Bethlehem and all its neighbourhood, according to the date
        he had so carefully ascertained from the Magi.

002:017 Then were these words, spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah, fulfilled,

002:018 "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation:
        It was Rachel bewailing her children, and she refused to be
        comforted because there were no more."

002:019 But after Herod's death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream
        to Joseph in Egypt, and said to him,

002:020 "Rise from sleep, and take the child and His mother, and go
        into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's
        life are dead."

002:021 So he roused himself and took the child and His mother and came
        into the land of Israel.

002:022 But hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod
        on the throne of Judaea, he was afraid to go there; and being
        instructed by God in a dream he withdrew into Galilee,

002:023 and went and settled in a town called Nazareth, in order that
        these words spoken through the Prophets might be fulfilled,
        "He shall be called a Nazarene."

003:001 About this time John the Baptist made his appearance,
        preaching in the Desert of Judaea.

003:002 "Repent," he said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now
        close at hand."

003:003 He it is who was spoken of through the Prophet Isaiah when he said,
        "The voice of one crying aloud, `In the desert prepare ye
        a road for the Lord:  make His highway straight.'"

003:004 This man John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a loincloth
        of leather; and he lived upon locusts and wild honey.

003:005 Then large numbers of people went out to him--people from Jerusalem
        and from all Judaea, and from the whole of the Jordan valley--

003:006 and were baptized by him in the Jordan, making full confession
        of their sins.

003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming
        for baptism, he exclaimed, "O vipers' brood, who has warned
        you to flee from the coming wrath?

003:008 Therefore let your lives prove your change of heart;

003:009 and do not imagine that you can say to yourselves, `We have
        Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can raise
        up descendants for Abraham from these stones.

003:010 And already the axe is lying at the root of the trees,
        so that every tree which does not produce good fruit will
        quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.

003:011 I indeed am baptizing you in water on a profession of repentance;
        but He who is coming after me is mightier than I:  His sandals
        I am not worthy to carry for a moment; He will baptize you
        in the Holy Spirit and in fire.

003:012 His winnowing-shovel is in His hand, and He will make a thorough
        clearance of His threshing-floor, gathering His wheat into
        the storehouse, but burning up the chaff in unquenchable fire."

003:013 Just at that time Jesus, coming from Galilee to the Jordan,
        presents Himself to John to be baptized by him.

003:014 John protested.  "It is I," he said, "who have need to be
        baptized by you, and do you come to me?"

003:015 "Let it be so on this occasion," Jesus replied; "for so we
        ought to fulfil every religious duty."  Then he consented;

003:016 and Jesus was baptized, and immediately went up from the water.
        At that moment the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit
        of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him,

003:017 while a voice came from Heaven, saying, "This is My Son,
        the dearly loved, in whom is My delight."

004:001 At that time Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the Desert
        in order to be tempted by the Devil.

004:002 There He fasted for forty days and nights; and after that He
        suffered from hunger.

004:003 So the Tempter came and said, "If you are the Son of God,
        command these stones to turn into loaves."

004:004 "It is written," replied Jesus, "`It is not on bread alone
        that a man shall live, but on whatsoever God shall appoint.'"

004:005 Then the Devil took Him to the Holy City and caused Him to stand
        on the roof of the Temple,

004:006 and said, "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down; for it
        is written, "`To His angels He will give orders concerning thee,
        and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any moment
        thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'"

004:007 "Again it is written," replied Jesus, "`Thou shalt not put
        the Lord thy God to the proof.'"

004:008 Then the Devil took Him to the top of an exceedingly lofty mountain,
        from which he caused Him to see all the Kingdoms of the world
        and their splendour,

004:009 and said to Him, "All this I will give you, if you will kneel
        down and do me homage."

004:010 "Begone, Satan!"  Jesus replied; "for it is written,
        `To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone
        shalt thou render worship.'"

004:011 Thereupon the Devil left Him, and angels at once came and
        ministered to Him.

004:012 Now when Jesus heard that John was thrown into prison,
        He withdrew into Galilee,

004:013 and leaving Nazareth He went and settled at Capernaum,
        a town by the Lake on the frontiers of Zebulun and Naphtali,

004:014 in order that these words, spoken through the Prophet Isaiah,
        might be fulfilled,

004:015 "Zebulun's land and Naphtali's land; the road by the Lake;
        the country beyond the Jordan; Galilee of the Nations!

004:016 The people who were dwelling in darkness have seen a brilliant light;
        and on those who were dwelling in the region of the shadow
        of death, on them light has dawned."

004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach.  "Repent," He said,
        "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."

004:018 And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw
        two brothers--Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew--
        throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fishers.

004:019 And He said to them, "Come and follow me, and I will make you
        fishers of men."

004:020 So they immediately left their nets and followed Him.
        As He went further on,

004:021 He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zabdi and his
        brother John, in the boat with their father Zabdi mending
        their nets; and He called them.

004:022 And they at once left the boat and their father, and followed Him.

004:023 Then Jesus travelled through all Galilee, teaching in their
        synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom,
        and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.

004:024 Thus His fame spread through all Syria; and they brought all
        the sick to Him, the people who were suffering from various
        diseases and pains--demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics;
        and He cured them.

004:025 And great crowds followed Him, coming from Galilee,
        from the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from beyond the district
        on the other side of the Jordan.

005:001 Seeing the multitude of people, Jesus went up the Hill.
        There He seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,

005:002 He proceeded to teach them, and said:

005:003 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom
        of the Heavens.

005:004 "Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.

005:005 "Blessed are the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession
        of the earth.

005:006 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
        for they shall be completely satisfied.

005:007 "Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.

005:008 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

005:009 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for it is they who will be
        recognized as sons of God.

005:010 "Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause
        of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.

005:011 "Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you,
        and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.

005:012 Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens;
        for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.

005:013 "*You* are the salt of the earth; but if salt has
        become tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness?
        It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away
        and trodden on by the passers by.

005:014 *You* are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built
        on a hill-top.

005:015 Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand;
        and then it gives light to all in the house.

005:016 Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they
        may see your holy lives and may give glory to your Father
        who is in Heaven.

005:017 "Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate
        the Law or the Prophets:  I have not come to abrogate them
        but to give them their completion.

005:018 Solemnly I tell you that until Heaven and earth pass away,
        not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law
        until all has taken place.

005:019 Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches
        others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom
        of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them,
        he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.

005:020 For I assure you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses
        that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly
        not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.

005:021 "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, `Thou shalt
        not commit murder', and whoever commits murder will be answerable
        to the magistrate.

005:022 But I say to you that every one who becomes angry with his
        brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says
        to his brother `Raca,' shall be answerable to the Sanhedrin;
        and that whoever says, `You fool!' shall be liable to the
        Gehenna of Fire.

005:023 If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar,
        you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,

005:024 leave your gift there before the altar, and go and make
        friends with your brother first, and then return and proceed
        to offer your gift.

005:025 Come to terms without delay with your opponent while you
        are yet with him on the way to the court; for fear
        he should obtain judgement from the magistrate against you,
        and the magistrate should give you in custody to the officer
        and you be thrown into prison.

005:026 I solemnly tell you that you will certainly not be released
        till you have paid the very last farthing.

005:027 "You have heard that it was said, `Thou shalt not commit adultery.'

005:028 But I tell you that whoever looks at a woman and cherishes
        lustful thoughts has already in his heart become guilty
        with regard to her.

005:029 If therefore your eye, even the right eye, is a snare to you,
        tear it out and away with it; it is better for you that one
        member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body
        should be thrown into Gehenna.

005:030 And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and away with it;
        it is better for you that one member should be destroyed
        rather than that your whole body should go into Gehenna.

005:031 "It was also said, `If any man puts away his wife, let him
        give her a written notice of divorce.'

005:032 But I tell you that every man who puts away his wife except
        on the ground of unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery,
        and whoever marries her when so divorced commits adultery.

005:033 "Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients,
        `Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform thy vows
        to the Lord.'

005:034 But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by Heaven,
        for it is God's throne;

005:035 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool under His feet;
        nor by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King.

005:036 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair
        white or black.

005:037 But let your language be, `Yes, yes,' or `No, no.'
        Anything in excess of this comes from the Evil one.

005:038 "You have heard that it was said, `Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.'

005:039 But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes
        you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.

005:040 If any one wishes to go to law with you and to deprive you
        of your under garment, let him take your outer one also.

005:041 And whoever shall compel you to convey his goods one mile,
        go with him two.

005:042 To him who asks, give:  from him who would borrow, turn not away.

005:043 "You have heard that it was said, `Thou shalt love thy neighbour
        and hate thine enemy.'

005:044 But I command you all, love your enemies, and pray
        for your persecutors;

005:045 that so you may become true sons of your Father in Heaven;
        for He causes His sun to rise on the wicked as well as the good,
        and sends rain upon those who do right and those who do wrong.

005:046 For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you earned?
        Do not even the tax-gatherers do that?

005:047 And if you salute only your near relatives, what praise is due
        to you?  Do not even the Gentiles do the same?

005:048 You however are to be complete in goodness, as your
        Heavenly Father is complete.

006:001 "But beware of doing your good actions in the sight of men,
        in order to attract their gaze; if you do, there is no reward
        for you with your Father who is in Heaven.

006:002 `When you give in charity, never blow a trumpet before you
        as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets in order
        that their praises may be sung by men.  I solemnly tell you
        that they already have their reward.

006:003 But when you are giving in charity, let not your left hand
        perceive what your right hand is doing,

006:004 that your charities may be in secret; and then your Father--He who
        sees in secret--will recompense you.

006:005 "And when praying, you must not be like the hypocrites.
        They are fond of standing and praying in the synagogues or at
        the corners of the wider streets, in order that men may see them.
        I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.

006:006 But you, whenever you pray, go into your own room and shut
        the door:  then pray to your Father who is in secret,
        and your Father--He who sees in secret--will recompense you.

006:007 "And when praying, do not use needless repetitions as the
        Gentiles do, for they expect to be listened to because of their
        multitude of words.

006:008 Do not, however, imitate them; for your Father knows what things
        you need before ever you ask Him.

006:009 "In this manner therefore pray:  `Our Father who art in Heaven,
        may Thy name be kept holy;

006:010 let Thy kingdom come; let Thy will be done, as in Heaven
        so on earth;

006:011 give us to-day our bread for the day;

006:012 and forgive us our shortcomings, as we also have forgiven
        those who have failed in their duty towards us;

006:013 and bring us not into temptation, but rescue us from the Evil one.'

006:014 "For if you forgive others their offences, your Heavenly Father
        will forgive you also;

006:015 but if you do not forgive others their offences, neither will
        your Father forgive yours.

006:016 "When any of you fast, never assume gloomy looks as the
        hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces in order
        that it may be evident to men that they are fasting.
        I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.

006:017 But, whenever you fast, pour perfume on your hair and
        wash your face,

006:018 that it may not be apparent to men that you are fasting,
        but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father--He who
        sees in secret--will recompense you.

006:019 "Do not lay up stores of wealth for yourselves on earth,
        where the moth and wear-and-tear destroy, and where thieves
        break in and steal.

006:020 But amass wealth for yourselves in Heaven, where neither the moth
        nor wear-and-tear destroys, and where thieves do not break
        in and steal.

006:021 For where your wealth is, there also will your heart be.

006:022 "The eye is the lamp of the body.  If then your eyesight is good,
        your whole body will be well lighted;

006:023 but if your eyesight is bad, your whole body will be dark.
        If however the very light within you is darkness, how dense
        must the darkness be!

006:024 "No man can be the bondservant of two masters; for either
        he will dislike one and like the other, or he will attach
        himself to one and think slightingly of the other.
        You cannot be the bondservants both of God and of gold.

006:025 For this reason I charge you not to be over-anxious about your lives,
        inquiring what you are to eat or what you are to drink, nor yet
        about your bodies, inquiring what clothes you are to put on.
        Is not the life more precious than its food, and the body
        than its clothing?

006:026 Look at the birds which fly in the air:  they do not sow or reap
        or store up in barns, but your Heavenly Father feeds them:
        are not you of much greater value than they?

006:027 Which of you by being over-anxious can add a single foot
        to his height?

006:028 And why be anxious about clothing?  Learn a lesson from the
        wild lilies.  Watch their growth.  They neither toil nor spin,

006:029 and yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his magnificence
        could array himself like one of these.

006:030 And if God so clothes the wild herbage which to-day flourishes
        and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, is it not much more
        certain that He will clothe you, you men of little faith?

006:031 Do not be over-anxious, therefore, asking `What shall we eat?'
        or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'

006:032 For all these are questions that Gentiles are always asking;
        but your Heavenly Father knows that you need these things--
        all of them.

006:033 But make His Kingdom and righteousness your chief aim,
        and then these things shall all be given you in addition.

006:034 Do not be over-anxious, therefore, about to-morrow,
        for to-morrow will bring its own cares.  Enough for each day
        are its own troubles.

007:001 "Judge not, that you may not be judged;

007:002 for your own judgement will be dealt--and your own
        measure meted--to yourselves.

007:003 And why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye,
        and not notice the beam which is in your own eye?

007:004 Or how say to your brother, `Allow me to take the splinter
        out of your eye,' while the beam is in your own eye?

007:005 Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye,
        and then you will see clearly how to remove the splinter
        from your brother's eye.

007:006 "Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls
        to the swine; otherwise they will trample them under their
        feet and then turn and attack you.

007:007 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
        knock, and the door will be opened to you.

007:008 For it is always he who asks that receives, he who seeks that finds,
        and he who knocks that has the door opened to him.

007:009 What man is there among you, who if his son shall ask him
        for bread will offer him a stone?

007:010 Or if the son shall ask him for a fish will offer him a snake?

007:011 If you then, imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts
        to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven
        give good things to those who ask Him!

007:012 Everything, therefore, be it what it may, that you would
        have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for in this
        the Law and the Prophets are summed up.

007:013 "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad the road
        which leads to ruin, and many there are who enter by it;

007:014 because narrow is the gate and contracted the road which leads
        to Life, and few are those who find it.

007:015 "Beware of the false teachers--men who come to you in sheep's fleeces,
        but beneath that disguise they are ravenous wolves.

007:016 By their fruits you will easily recognize them.
        Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from brambles?

007:017 Just so every good tree produces good fruit, but a poisonous
        tree produces bad fruit.

007:018 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a poisonous tree good fruit.

007:019 Every tree which does not yield good fruit is cut down and thrown
        aside for burning.

007:020 So by their fruits at any rate, you will easily recognize them.

007:021 "Not every one who says to me, `Master, Master,' will enter
        the Kingdom of the Heavens, but only those who are obedient
        to my Father who is in Heaven.

007:022 Many will say to me on that day, "`Master, Master, have we
        not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name expelled demons,
        and in Thy name performed many mighty works?'

007:023 "And then I will tell them plainly, "`I never knew you:
        begone from me, you doers of wickedness.'

007:024 "Every one who hears these my teachings and acts upon them will
        be found to resemble a wise man who builds his house upon rock;

007:025 and the heavy rain falls, the swollen torrents come, and the winds
        blow and beat against the house; yet it does not fall,
        for its foundation is on rock.

007:026 And every one who hears these my teachings and does not act
        upon them will be found to resemble a fool who builds his
        house upon sand.

007:027 The heavy rain descends, the swollen torrents come,
        and the winds blow and burst upon the house, and it falls;
        and disastrous is the fall."

007:028 When Jesus had concluded this discourse, the crowds were filled
        with amazement at His teaching,

007:029 for He had been teaching them as one who had authority,
        and not as their Scribes taught.

008:001 Upon descending from the hill country He was followed
        by immense crowds.

008:002 And a leper came to Him, and throwing himself at His feet,
        said, "Sir, if only you are willing you are able to cleanse me."

008:003 So Jesus put out His hand and touched him, and said, "I am willing:
        be cleansed."  Instantly he was cleansed from his leprosy;

008:004 and Jesus said to him, "Be careful to tell no one, but go
        and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses
        appointed as evidence for them."

008:005 After His entry into Capernaum a Captain came to Him,
        and entreated Him.

008:006 "Sir," he said, "my servant at home is lying ill with paralysis,
        and is suffering great pain."

008:007 "I will come and cure him," said Jesus.

008:008 "Sir," replied the Captain, "I am not a fit person to receive
        you under my roof:  merely say the word, and my servant
        will be cured.

008:009 For I myself am also under authority, and have soldiers under me.
        To one I say `Go,' and he goes, to another `Come,' and he comes,
        and to my slave `Do this or that,' and he does it."

008:010 Jesus listened to this reply, and was astonished, and said
        to the people following Him, "I solemnly tell you that in no
        Israelite have I found faith as great as this.

008:011 And I tell you that many will come from the east and from
        the west and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
        in the Kingdom of the Heavens,

008:012 while the natural heirs of the Kingdom will be driven out
        into the darkness outside:  there will be the weeping aloud
        and the gnashing of teeth."

008:013 And Jesus said to the Captain, "Go, and just as you have believed,
        so be it for you."  And the servant recovered precisely
        at that time.

008:014 After this Jesus went to the house of Peter, whose mother-in-law
        he found ill in bed with fever.

008:015 He touched her hand and the fever left her:  and then she rose
        and waited upon Him.

008:016 In the evening many demoniacs were brought to Him, and with
        a word He expelled the demons; and He cured all the sick,

008:017 in order that this prediction of the Prophet Isaiah might
        be fulfilled, "He took on Him our weaknesses, and bore
        the burden of our diseases."

008:018 Seeing great crowds about Him Jesus had given directions
        to cross to the other side of the Lake,

008:019 when a Scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow
        you wherever you go."

008:020 "Foxes have holes," replied Jesus, "and birds have nests;
        but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."

008:021 Another of the disciples said to Him, "Sir, allow me first to go
        and bury my father."

008:022 "Follow me," said Jesus, "and leave the dead to bury
        their own dead."

008:023 Then He went on board a fishing-boat, and His disciples followed Him.

008:024 But suddenly there arose a great storm on the Lake, so that
        the waves threatened to engulf the boat; but He was asleep.

008:025 So they came and woke Him, crying, "Master, save us,
        we are drowning!"

008:026 "Why are you so easily frightened," He replied, "you men of
        little faith?"  Then He rose and reproved the winds and the waves,
        and there was a perfect calm;

008:027 and the men, filled with amazement, exclaimed, "What kind
        of man is this? for the very winds and waves obey him!"

008:028 On His arrival at the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes,
        there met Him two men possessed by demons, coming from among
        the tombs:  they were so dangerously fierce that no one was
        able to pass that way.

008:029 They cried aloud, "What hast Thou to do with us, Thou Son
        of God?  Hast Thou come here to torment us before the time?"

008:030 Now at some distance from them a vast herd of swine were feeding.

008:031 So the demons entreated Him.  "If Thou drivest us out,"
        they said, "send us into the herd of swine."

008:032 "Go," He replied.  Then they came out from the men and went
        into the swine, whereupon the entire herd instantly rushed
        down the cliff into the Lake and perished in the water.

008:033 The swineherds fled, and went and told the whole story in the town,
        including what had happened to the demoniacs.

008:034 So at once the whole population came out to meet Jesus;
        and when they saw Him, they besought Him to leave their country.

009:001 Accordingly He went on board, and crossing over came to
        His own town.

009:002 Here they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed.
        Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take courage,
        my child; your sins are pardoned."

009:003 "Such language is impious," said some of the Scribes
        among themselves.

009:004 Knowing their thoughts Jesus said, "Why are you cherishing
        evil thoughts in your hearts?

009:005 Why, which is easier?--to say, `Your sins are pardoned,'
        or to say `Rise up and walk'?

009:006 But, to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth
        to pardon sins"--He then says to the paralytic, "Rise, and take
        up your bed and go home."

009:007 And he got up, and went off home.

009:008 And the crowds were awe-struck when they saw it, and ascribed
        the glory to God who had entrusted such power to a man.

009:009 Passing on thence Jesus saw a man called Matthew sitting
        at the Toll Office, and said to him, "Follow me."
        And he arose, and followed Him.

009:010 And while He was reclining at table, a large number of
        tax-gathers and notorious sinners were of the party with Jesus
        and His disciples.

009:011 The Pharisees noticed this, and they inquired of His disciples,
        "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers
        and notorious sinners?"

009:012 He heard the question and replied, "It is not men in good health
        who require a doctor, but the sick.

009:013 But go and learn what this means, `It is mercy that I desire,
        not sacrifice'; for I did not come to appeal to the righteous,
        but to sinners."

009:014 At that time John's disciples came and asked Jesus, "Why do we
        and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"

009:015 "Can the bridegroom's party mourn," He replied, "as long
        as the bridegroom is with them?  But other days will come
        (when the Bridegroom has been taken from them) and then
        they will fast.

009:016 No one ever mends an old cloak with a patch of newly woven cloth.
        Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away some of the old,
        and a worse hole would be made.

009:017 Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins.  Otherwise, the skins
        would split, the wine would escape, and the skins be destroyed.
        But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved."

009:018 While He was thus speaking, a Ruler came up and profoundly
        bowing said, "My daughter is just dead; but come and put
        your hand upon her and she will return to life."

009:019 And Jesus rose and followed him, as did also His disciples.

009:020 But a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage
        came behind Him and touched the tassel of His cloak;

009:021 for she said to herself, "If I but touch His cloak,
        I shall be cured."

009:022 And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Take courage, daughter;
        your faith has cured you."  And the woman was restored
        to health from that moment.

009:023 Entering the Ruler's house, Jesus saw the flute-players
        and the crowd loudly wailing,

009:024 and He said, "Go out of the room; the little girl is not dead,
        but asleep."  And they laughed at Him.

009:025 When however the place was cleared of the crowd, Jesus went in,
        and on His taking the little girl by the hand, she rose up.

009:026 And the report of this spread throughout all that district.

009:027 As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed Him, shouting and saying,
        "Pity us, Son of David."

009:028 And when He had gone indoors, they came to Him.
        "Do you believe that I can do this?"  He asked them.
        "Yes, Sir," they replied.

009:029 So He touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith
        let it be to you."

009:030 Then their eyes were opened.  And assuming a stern tone Jesus
        said to them, "Be careful to let no one know."

009:031 But they went out and published His fame in all that district.

009:032 And as they were leaving His presence a dumb demoniac was
        brought to Him.

009:033 When the demon was expelled, the dumb man could speak.
        And the crowds exclaimed in astonishment, "Never was such
        a thing seen in Israel."

009:034 But the Pharisees maintained, "It is by the power of the Prince
        of the demons that he drives out the demons."

009:035 And Jesus continued His circuits through all the towns and
        the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming
        the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of
        disease and infirmity.

009:036 And when He saw the crowds He was touched with pity for them,
        because they were distressed and were fainting on the ground
        like sheep which have no shepherd.

009:037 Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is abundant,
        but the reapers are few;

009:038 therefore entreat the Owner of the Harvest to send out reapers
        into His fields."

010:001 Then He called to Him His twelve disciples and gave them
        authority over foul spirits, to drive them out; and to cure
        every kind of disease and infirmity.

010:002 Now the names of the twelve Apostles were these:  first, Simon
        called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zabdi,
        and his brother John;

010:003 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer,
        James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

010:004 Simon the Cananaean, and Judas the Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

010:005 These twelve Jesus sent on a mission, after giving them
        their instructions:  "Go not," He said, "among the Gentiles,
        and enter no Samaritan town;

010:006 but, instead of that, go to the lost sheep of Israel's race.

010:007 And as you go, preach and say, `The Kingdom of the Heavens
        is close at hand.'

010:008 Cure the sick, raise the dead to life, cleanse lepers,
        drive out demons:  you have received without payment,
        give without payment.

010:009 "Provide no gold, nor even silver nor copper to carry
        in your pockets;

010:010 no bag for your journey, nor change of linen, nor shoes,
        nor stick; for the labourer deserves his food.

010:011 "Whatever town or village you enter, inquire for some good man;
        and make his house your home till you leave the place.

010:012 When you enter the house, salute it;

010:013 and if the house deserves it, the peace you invoke shall come
        upon it.  If not, your peace shall return to you.

010:014 And whoever refuses to receive you or even to listen to your Message,
        as you leave that house or town, shake off the very dust
        from your feet.

010:015 I solemnly tell you that it will be more endurable for the land
        of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of Judgement than for that town.

010:016 "Remember it is I who am sending you out, as sheep into
        the midst of wolves; prove yourselves as sagacious as serpents,
        and as innocent as doves.

010:017 But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to appear
        before Sanhedrins, and will flog you in their synagogues;

010:018 and you will even be put on trial before governors and kings
        for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.

010:019 But when they have delivered you up, have no anxiety as to how
        you shall speak or what you shall say; for at that very time
        it shall be given you what to say;

010:020 for it is not you who will speak:  it will be the Spirit
        of your Father speaking through you.

010:021 Brother will betray brother to death, and father, child;
        and children will rise against their own parents and will put
        them to death.

010:022 And you will be objects of universal hatred because you
        are called by my name; but he who holds out to the End--
        he will be saved.

010:023 Whenever they persecute you in one town, escape to the next;
        for I solemnly tell you that you will not have gone the round
        of all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

010:024 "The learner is never superior to his teacher, and the servant
        is never superior to his master.

010:025 Enough for the learner to be on a level with his teacher,
        and for the servant to be on a level with his master.
        If they have called the master of the house Baal-zebul,
        how much more will they slander his servants?

010:026 Fear them not, however; there is nothing veiled which will
        not be uncovered, nor secret which will not become known.

010:027 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what is
        whispered into your ear, proclaim upon the roofs of the houses.

010:028 "And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul;
        but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and
        body in Gehenna.

010:029 Do not two sparrows sell for a halfpenny?  Yet not one of them
        will fall to the ground without your Father's leave.

010:030 But as for you, the very hairs on your heads are all numbered.

010:031 Away then with fear; you are more precious than a
        multitude of sparrows.

010:032 "Every man who acknowledges me before men I also will acknowledge
        before my Father who is in Heaven.

010:033 But whoever disowns me before men I also will disown before
        my Father who is in Heaven.

010:034 "Do not suppose that I came to bring peace to the earth:
        I did not come to bring peace but a sword.

010:035 For I came to set a man against his father, a daughter against
        her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;

010:036 and a man's own family will be his foes.

010:037 Any one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy
        of me, and any one who loves son or daughter more than me
        is not worthy of me;

010:038 and any one who does not take up his cross and follow where I
        lead is not worthy of me.

010:039 To save your life is to lose it, and to lose your life for my
        sake is to save it.

010:040 "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me
        receives Him who sent me.

010:041 Every one who receives a prophet, because he is a prophet,
        will receive a prophet's reward, and every one who receives
        a righteous man, because he is a righteous man, will receive
        a righteous man's reward.

010:042 And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold
        water to drink because he is a disciple, I solemnly tell you
        that he will not lose his reward."

011:001 When Jesus had concluded His instructions to His twelve disciples,
        He left in order to teach and to proclaim His Message
        in the neighbouring towns.

011:002 Now John had heard in prison about the Christ's doings,
        and he sent some of his disciples to inquire:

011:003 "Are you the Coming One, or is it a different person that we
        are to expect?"

011:004 "Go and report to John what you see and hear," replied Jesus;

011:005 "blind eyes receive sight, and cripples walk; lepers are cleansed,
        and deaf ears hear; the dead are raised to life, and the poor
        have the Good News proclaimed to them;

011:006 and blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because
        of my claims."

011:007 When the messengers had taken their leave, Jesus proceeded
        to say to the multitude concerning John, "What did you go
        out into the Desert to gaze at?  A reed waving in the wind?

011:008 But what did you go out to see?  A man luxuriously dressed?
        Those who wear luxurious clothes are to be found in kings' palaces.

011:009 But why did you go out?  To see a prophet?  Yes, I tell you,
        and far more than a prophet.

011:010 This is he of whom it is written, "`See I am sending My messenger
        before Thy face, and he will make Thy road ready before Thee.'

011:011 "I solemnly tell you that among all of woman born no
        greater has ever been raised up than John the Baptist;
        yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of the Heavens
        is greater than he.

011:012 But from the time of John the Baptist till now, the Kingdom
        of the Heavens has been suffering violent assault,
        and the violent have been seizing it by force.

011:013 For all the Prophets and the Law taught until John.

011:014 And (if you are willing to receive it) he is the Elijah
        who was to come.

011:015 Listen, every one who has ears!

011:016 "But to what shall I compare the present generation?
        It is like children sitting in the open places, who call
        to their playmates.

011:017 "`We have played the flute to you,' they say, `and you
        have not danced:  we have sung dirges, and you have not
        beaten your breasts.'

011:018 "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
        `He has a demon.'

011:019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they exclaim,
        `See this man!--given to gluttony and tippling,
        and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'
        And yet Wisdom is vindicated by her actions."

011:020 Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of His mighty
        works had been done--because they had not repented.

011:021 "Alas for thee, Chorazin!"  He cried.  "Alas for
        thee, Bethsaida!  For had the mighty works been done in Tyre
        and Sidon which have been done in both of you, they would long
        ere now have repented, covered with sackcloth and ashes.

011:022 Only I tell you that it will be more endurable for Tyre
        and Sidon on the day of Judgement than for you.

011:023 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted even to Heaven?  Even to
        Hades shalt thou descend.  For had the mighty works been
        done in Sodom which have been done in thee, it would have
        remained until now.

011:024 Only I tell you all, that it will be more endurable for the land
        of Sodom on the day of Judgement than for thee."

011:025 About that time Jesus exclaimed, "I heartily praise
        Thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and of earth, that Thou hast
        hidden these things from sages and men of discernment,
        and hast unveiled them to babes.

011:026 Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.

011:027 "All things have been handed over to me by my Father,
        and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does
        any one fully know the Father except the Son and all to whom
        the Son chooses to reveal Him.

011:028 "Come to me, all you toiling and burdened ones, and *I* will
        give you rest.

011:029 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am gentle
        and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

011:030 For it is good to bear my yoke, and my burden is light."

012:001 About that time Jesus passed on the Sabbath through the wheatfields;
        and His disciples became hungry, and began to gather ears
        of wheat and eat them.

012:002 But the Pharisees saw it and said to Him, "Look! your disciples
        are doing what the Law forbids them to do on the Sabbath."

012:003 "Have you never read," He replied, "what David did when he and
        his men were hungry?

012:004 how he entered the House of God and ate the Presented Loaves,
        which it was not lawful for him or his men to eat, nor for any
        except the priests?

012:005 And have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests
        in the Temple break the Sabbath without incurring guilt?

012:006 But I tell you that there is here that which is greater
        than the Temple.

012:007 And if you knew what this means, `It is mercy I desire,
        not sacrifice', you would not have condemned those who
        are without guilt.

012:008 For the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath."

012:009 Departing thence He went to their synagogue,

012:010 where there was a man with a shrivelled arm.
        And they questioned Him, "Is it right to cure people on
        the Sabbath?"  Their intention was to bring a charge against Him.

012:011 "Which of you is there," He replied, "who, if he has but
        a single sheep and it falls into a hole on the Sabbath,
        will not lay hold of it and lift it out?

012:012 Is not a man, however, far superior to a sheep?
        Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath."

012:013 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your arm."
        And he stretched it out, and it was restored quite sound
        like the other.

012:014 But the Pharisees after leaving the synagogue consulted together
        against Him, how they might destroy Him.

012:015 Aware of this, Jesus departed elsewhere; and a great number
        of people followed Him, all of whom He cured.

012:016 But He gave them strict injunctions not to blaze abroad His doings,

012:017 that those words of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,

012:018 "This is My servant whom I have chosen, My dearly loved One
        in whom My soul takes pleasure.  I will put My spirit upon Him,
        and He will announce justice to the nations.

012:019 He will not wrangle or raise His voice, nor will His voice
        be heard in the broadways.

012:020 A crushed reed He will not utterly break, nor will He quench
        the still smouldering wick, until He has led on Justice to victory.

012:021 And on His name shall the nations rest their hopes."

012:022 At that time a demoniac was brought to Him, blind and dumb;
        and He cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.

012:023 And the crowds of people were all filled with amazement and said,
        "Can this be the Son of David?"

012:024 The Pharisees heard it and said, "This man only expels demons
        by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of demons."

012:025 Knowing their thoughts He said to them, "Every kingdom in which
        civil war has raged suffers desolation; and every city or house
        in which there is internal strife will be brought low.

012:026 And if Satan is expelling Satan, he has begun to make war on himself:
        how therefore shall his kingdom last?

012:027 And if it is by Baal-zebul's power that I expel the demons,
        by whose power do your disciples expel them?  They therefore
        shall be your judges.

012:028 But if it is by the power of the Spirit of God that I expel
        the demons, it is evident that the Kingdom of God has
        come upon you.

012:029 Again, how can any one enter the house of a strong man and carry
        off his goods, unless first of all he masters and secures
        the strong man:  then he will ransack his house.

012:030 "The man who is not with me is against me, and he who is not
        gathering with me is scattering abroad.

012:031 This is why I tell you that men may find forgiveness for every
        other sin and impious word, but that for impious speaking
        against the Holy Spirit they shall find no forgiveness.

012:032 And whoever shall speak against the Son of Man may obtain forgiveness;
        but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this
        nor in the coming age shall he obtain forgiveness."

012:033 "Either grant the tree to be wholesome and its fruit wholesome,
        or the tree poisonous and its fruit poisonous; for the tree
        is known by its fruit.

012:034 O vipers' brood, how can you speak what is good when you are evil?
        For it is from the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks.

012:035 A good man from his good store produces good things, and a bad
        man from his bad store produces bad things.

012:036 But I tell you that for every careless word that men shall
        speak they will be held accountable on the day of Judgement.

012:037 For each of you by his words shall be justified, or by his words
        shall be condemned."

012:038 Then He was accosted by some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees
        who said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign given by you."

012:039 "Wicked and faithless generation!"  He replied, "they clamour
        for a sign, but none shall be given to them except the sign
        of the Prophet Jonah.

012:040 For just as Jonah was three days in the sea-monster's belly,
        so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.

012:041 There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement
        together with the present generation, and will condemn it;
        because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and mark!
        there is One greater than Jonah here.

012:042 The Queen of the south will awake at the Judgement together
        with the present generation, and will condemn it; because she
        came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        and mark! there is One greater than Solomon here.

012:043 "No sooner however has the foul spirit gone out of the man,
        then he roams about in places where there is no water,
        seeking rest but finding none.

012:044 Then he says, `I will return to my house that I left;'
        and he comes and finds it unoccupied, swept clean,
        and in good order.

012:045 Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more
        wicked than himself, and they come in and dwell there; and in
        the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first.
        So will it be also with the present wicked generation."

012:046 While He was still addressing the people His mother and His
        brothers were standing on the edge of the crowd desiring
        to speak to Him.

012:047 So some one told Him, "Your mother and your brothers are
        standing outside, and desire to speak to you."

012:048 "Who is my mother?"  He said to the man; "and who are my brothers?"

012:049 And pointing to His disciples He added, "See here are my mother
        and my brothers.

012:050 To obey my Father who is in Heaven--that is to be my brother
        and my sister and my mother."

013:001 That same day Jesus had left the house and was sitting on
        the shore of the Lake,

013:002 when a vast multitude of people crowded round Him.
        He therefore went on board a boat and sat there, while all
        the people stood on the shore.

013:003 He then spoke many things to them in figurative language.
        "The sower goes out," He said, "to sow.

013:004 As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds
        come and peck it up.

013:005 Some falls on rocky ground, where it has but scanty soil.
        It quickly shows itself above ground, because it has no
        depth of earth;

013:006 but when the sun is risen, it is scorched by the heat,
        and through having no root it withers up.

013:007 Some falls among the thorns; but the thorns spring up
        and stifle it.

013:008 But a portion falls upon good ground, and gives a return,
        some a hundred for one, some sixty, some thirty.

013:009 Listen, every one who has ears!"

013:010 (And His disciples came and asked Him, "Why do you speak
        to them in figurative language?"

013:011 "Because," He replied, "while to you it is granted to know
        the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, to them it is not.

013:012 For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall
        have abundance; but whoever has not, from him even what he has
        shall be taken away.

013:013 I speak to them in figurative language for this reason,
        that while looking they do not see, and while hearing they
        neither hear nor understand.

013:014 And in regard to them the prophecy of Isaiah is receiving
        signal fulfilment:  "`You will hear and hear and by no
        means understand, and you will look and look and by no means see.

013:015 For this people's mind is stupefied, their hearing has
        become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent
        their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears,
        or understanding with their minds, and turning back,
        so that I might heal them.'

013:016 "But as for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see,
        and your ears, for they hear.

013:017 For I solemnly tell you that many Prophets and holy men have
        longed to see the sights you see, and have not seen them,
        and to hear the words you hear, and have not heard them.

013:018 "To you then I will explain the parable of the Sower.

013:019 When a man hears the Message concerning the Kingdom and does
        not understand it, the Evil one comes and catches away what has
        been sown in his heart.  This is he who has received the seed
        by the road-side.

013:020 He who has received the seed on the rocky ground is the man
        who hears the Message and immediately receives it with joy.

013:021 It has struck no root, however, within him.  He continues
        for a time, but when suffering comes, or persecution,
        because of the Message, he at once stumbles and falls.

013:022 He who has received the seed among the thorns is the man
        who hears the Message, but the cares of the present age
        and the delusions of riches quite stifle the Message,
        and it becomes unfruitful.

013:023 But he who has received the seed on good ground is he who hears
        and understands.  Such hearers give a return, and yield one
        a hundred for one, another sixty, another thirty.")

013:024 Another parable He put before them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "may be compared to a man who has sown
        good seed in his field,

013:025 but during the night his enemy comes, and over the first seed
        he sows darnel among the wheat, and goes away.

013:026 But when the blade shoots up and the grain is formed,
        then appears the darnel also.

013:027 "So the farmer's men come and ask him, "`Sir, was it not
        good seed that you sowed on your land?  Where then does
        the darnel come from?'

013:028 "`Some enemy has done this,' he said.  "`Shall we go,
        and collect it?' the men inquire.

013:029 "`No,' he replied, `for fear that while collecting the darnel
        you should at the same time root up the wheat with it.

013:030 Leave both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest-time
        I will direct the reapers, Collect the darnel first,
        and make it up into bundles to burn it, but bring all the wheat
        into my barn.'"

013:031 Another parable He put before them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "is like a mustard-seed, which a man
        takes and sows in his ground.

013:032 It is the smallest of all seeds, and yet when full-grown it
        is larger than any herb and forms a tree, so that the birds
        come and build in its branches."

013:033 Another parable He spoke to them.  "The Kingdom of
        the Heavens," He said, "is like yeast which a woman takes
        and buries in a bushel of flour, for it to work there till
        the whole mass has risen."

013:034 All this Jesus spoke to the people in figurative language,
        and except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them,

013:035 in fulfilment of the saying of the Prophet, "I will open
        my mouth in figurative language, I will utter things kept
        hidden since the creation of all things."

013:036 When He had dismissed the people and had returned to the house,
        His disciples came to Him with the request, "Explain to us
        the parable of the darnel sown in the field."

013:037 "The sower of the good seed," He replied, "is the Son of Man;

013:038 the field is the world; the good seed--these are the sons
        of the Kingdom; the darnel, the sons of the Evil one.

013:039 The enemy who sows the darnel is *the Devil*; the harvest
        is the Close of the Age; the reapers are the angels.

013:040 As then the darnel is collected together and burnt up with fire,
        so will it be at the Close of the Age.

013:041 The Son of Man will commission His angels, and they will gather
        out of His Kingdom all causes of sin and all who violate His laws;

013:042 and these they will throw into the fiery furnace.
        There will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.

013:043 Then will the righteous shine out like the sun in their
        Father's Kingdom.  Listen, every one who has ears!

013:044 "The Kingdom of the Heavens is like treasure buried in
        the open country, which a man finds, but buries again, and,
        in his joy about it, goes and sells all he has and buys
        that piece of ground.

013:045 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a jewel merchant
        who is in quest of choice pearls.

013:046 He finds one most costly pearl; he goes away; and though it
        costs all he has, he buys it.

013:047 "Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a draw-net let
        down into the sea, which encloses fish of all sorts.

013:048 When full, they haul it up on the beach, and sit down and collect
        the good fish in baskets, while the worthless they throw away.

013:049 So will it be at the Close of the Age.  The angels will go
        forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,

013:050 and will throw them into the fiery furnace.  There will be
        the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."

013:051 "Have you understood all this?"  He asked.  "Yes," they said.

013:052 "Therefore," He said, "remember that every Scribe well trained
        for the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a householder who brings
        out of his storehouse new things and old."

013:053 Jesus concluded this series of parables and then departed.

013:054 And He came into His own country and proceeded to teach in
        their synagogue, so that they were filled with astonishment
        and exclaimed, "Where did he obtain such wisdom,
        and these wondrous powers?

013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son?  Is not his mother called Mary?
        And are not his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon and Judah?

013:056 And his sisters--are they not all living here among us?
        Where then did he get all this?"

013:057 So they turned angrily away from Him.  But Jesus said to them,
        "There is no prophet left without honour except in his own
        country and among his own family."

013:058 And He performed but few mighty deeds there because of their
        want of faith.

014:001 About that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

014:002 and he said to his courtiers, "This is John the Baptist:
        he has come back to life--and that is why these miraculous
        Powers are working in him."

014:003 For Herod had arrested John, and had put him in chains,
        and imprisoned him, for the sake of Herodias his
        brother Philip's wife,

014:004 because John had persistently said to him, "It is not lawful
        for you to have her."

014:005 And he would have liked to put him to death, but was afraid
        of the people, because they regarded John as a Prophet.

014:006 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced
        before all the company, and so pleased Herod

014:007 that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she asked.

014:008 So she, instigated by her mother, said, "Give me here on a dish
        the head of John the Baptist."

014:009 The king was deeply vexed, yet because of his repeated oath
        and of the guests at his table he ordered it to be given her,

014:010 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.

014:011 The head was brought on a dish and given to the young girl,
        and she took it to her mother.

014:012 Then John's disciples went and removed the body and buried it,
        and came and informed Jesus.

014:013 Upon receiving these tidings, Jesus went away by boat to an
        uninhabited and secluded district; but the people heard of it
        and followed Him in crowds from the towns by land.

014:014 So Jesus went out and saw an immense multitude, and felt compassion
        for them, and cured those of them who were out of health.

014:015 But when evening was come, the disciples came to Him and said,
        "This is an uninhabited place, and the best of the day is
        now gone; send the people away to go into the villages and buy
        something to eat."

014:016 "They need not go away," replied Jesus; "you yourselves must
        give them something to eat."

014:017 "We have nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and a
        couple of fish."

014:018 "Bring them here to me," He said,

014:019 and He told all the people to sit down on the grass.
        Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after
        looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves
        and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed
        them to the people.

014:020 So all ate, and were fully satisfied.  The broken portions
        that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.

014:021 Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning
        women and children.

014:022 Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board
        the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him
        to dismiss the people.

014:023 When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude.
        Night came on, and he was there alone.

014:024 Meanwhile the boat was far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed
        by the waves, the wind being adverse.

014:025 But towards daybreak He went to them, walking over the waves.

014:026 When the disciples saw Him walking on the waves, they were
        greatly alarmed.  "It is a spirit," they exclaimed, and they
        cried out with terror.

014:027 But instantly Jesus spoke to them, and said, "There is no danger;
        it is I; do not be afraid."

014:028 "Master," answered Peter, "if it is you, bid me come to you
        upon the water."

014:029 "Come," said Jesus.  Then Peter climbed down from the boat
        and walked upon the water to go to Him.

014:030 But when he felt the wind he grew frightened, and beginning
        to sink he cried out, "Master, save me."

014:031 Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him,
        saying to him, "O little faith, why did you doubt?"

014:032 So they climbed into the boat, and the wind lulled;

014:033 and the men on board fell down before him and said, "You are
        indeed God's Son."

014:034 When they had quite crossed over, they put ashore at Gennesaret;

014:035 and the men of the place, recognizing Him, sent word into all
        the country round.  So they brought all the sick to Him,

014:036 and they entreated Him that they might but touch the tassel
        of His outer garment; and all who did so were restored
        to perfect health.

015:001 Then there came to Jesus a party of Pharisees and Scribes
        from Jerusalem, who inquired,

015:002 "Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders
        by not washing their hands before meals?"

015:003 "Why do you, too," He retorted, "transgress God's commands
        for the sake of your tradition?

015:004 For God said, `Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Let him
        who reviles father or mother be certainly put to death';

015:005 but you--this is what you say:  `If a man says to his father
        or mother, That is consecrated, whatever it is, which otherwise
        you should have received from me--

015:006 he shall be absolved from honouring his father'; and so you
        have abrogated God's Word for the sake of your tradition.

015:007 Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you,

015:008 "`This is a People who honour Me with their lips, while their
        heart is far away from Me;

015:009 but it is in vain they worship Me, while they lay down precepts
        which are mere human rules.'"

015:010 Then, when He had called the people to Him, Jesus said,
        "Hear and understand.

015:011 It is not what goes into a man's mouth that defiles him;
        but it is what comes out of his mouth--that* defiles a man."

015:012 Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do you know that the
        Pharisees were greatly shocked when they heard those words?"

015:013 "Every plant," He replied, "which my Heavenly Father has not
        planted will be rooted up.

015:014 Leave them alone.  They are blind guides of the blind;
        and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall
        into some pit."

015:015 "Explain to us this figurative language," said Peter.

015:016 "Are even you," He answered, "still without intellingence?

015:017 Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth passes
        into the stomach and is afterwards ejected from the body?

015:018 But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart,
        and it is these that defile the man.

015:019 For out of the heart proceed wicked thoughts, murder, adultery,
        fornication, theft, perjury, impiety of speech.

015:020 These are the things which defile the man; but eating with
        unwashed hands does not defile."

015:021 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of
        Tyre and Sidon.

015:022 Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and persistently
        cried out, "Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly
        harassed by a demon."

015:023 But He answered her not a word.  Then the disciples interposed,
        and begged Him, saying, "Send her away because she keeps
        crying behind us."

015:024 "I have only been sent to the lost sheep of the house
        of Israel," He replied.

015:025 Then she came and threw herself at His feet and entreated Him.
        "O Sir, help me," she said.

015:026 "It is not right," He said, "to take the children's bread
        and throw it to the dogs."

015:027 "Be it so, Sir," she said, "for even the dogs eat the scraps
        which fall from their masters' tables."

015:028 "O woman," replied Jesus, "great is your faith:  be it done
        to you as you desire."  And from that moment her daughter
        was restored to health.

015:029 Again, moving thence, Jesus went along by the Lake of Galilee;
        and ascending the hill, He sat down there.

015:030 Soon great crowds came to Him, bringing with them
        those who were crippled in feet or hands, blind or dumb,
        and many besides, and they hastened to lay them at His feet.
        And He cured them,

015:031 so that the people were amazed to see the dumb speaking, the maimed
        with their hands perfect, the lame walking, and the blind seeing;
        and they gave the glory to the God of Israel.

015:032 But Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "My heart
        yearns over this mass of people, for it is now the third day
        that they have been with me and they have nothing to eat.
        I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they should faint
        on the road."

015:033 "Where can we," asked the disciples, "get bread enough in this
        remote place to satisfy so vast a multitude?"

015:034 "How many loaves have you?"  Jesus asked.  "Seven," they said,
        "and a few small fish."

015:035 So He bade all the people sit down on the ground,

015:036 and He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks
        He broke them up and then distributed them to the disciples,
        and they to the people.

015:037 And they all ate and were satisfied.  The broken portions
        that remained over they took up--seven full hampers.

015:038 Those who ate were 4,000 adult men, without reckoning
        women and children.

015:039 He then dismissed the people, went on board the boat,
        and came into the district of Magadan.

016:001 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him; and, to make
        trial of Him, they asked Him to show them a sign in the sky.

016:002 He replied, "In the evening you say, `It will be fine weather,
        for the sky is red;'

016:003 and in the morning, `It will be rough weather to-day, for the sky
        is red and murky.'  You learn how to distinguish the aspect
        of the heavens, but the signs of the times you cannot.

016:004 A wicked and faithless generation are eager for a sign;
        but none shall be given to them except the sign of Jonah."
        and He left them and went away.

016:005 When the disciples arrived at the other side of the Lake,
        they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread;

016:006 and when Jesus said to them, "See to it:  beware of the yeast
        of the Pharisees and Sadducees,"

016:007 they reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we
        have not brought any bread."

016:008 Jesus perceived this and said, "Why are you reasoning
        among yourselves, you men of little faith, because you
        have no bread?

016:009 Do you not yet understand? nor even remember the 5,000 and
        the five loaves, and how many basketfuls you carried away,

016:010 nor the 4,000 and the seven loaves, and how many hampers
        you carried away?

016:011 How is it you do not understand that it was not about bread
        that I spoke to you?  But beware of the yeast of the
        Pharisees and Sadducees."

016:012 Then they perceived that He had not warned them against bread-yeast,
        but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

016:013 When He arrived in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus
        questioned His disciples.  "Who do people say that the Son
        of Man is?"  He asked.

016:014 "Some say John the Baptist," they replied; "others Elijah;
        others Jeremiah or one of the Prophets."

016:015 "But you, who do you say that I am?"  He asked again.

016:016 "You," replied Simon Peter, "are the Christ, the Son of
        the ever-living God."

016:017 "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-jonah," said Jesus; "for mere human
        nature has not revealed this to you, but my Father in Heaven.

016:018 And I declare to you that you are Peter, and that upon this
        Rock I will build my Church, and the might of Hades shall
        not triumph over it.

016:019 I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of the Heavens;
        and whatever you bind on earth shall remain bound in Heaven,
        and whatever you loose on earth shall remain loosed in Heaven."

016:020 Then He urged His disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ.

016:021 From this time Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He
        must go to Jerusalem, and suffer much cruelty from the Elders
        and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death,
        and on the third day be raised to life again.

016:022 Then Peter took Him aside and began taking Him to task.
        "Master," he said, "God forbid; this will not be your lot."

016:023 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Adversary;
        you are a hindrance to me, because your thoughts are not
        God's thoughts, but men's."

016:024 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If any one desires
        to follow me, let him renounce self and take up his cross,
        and so be my follower.

016:025 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever
        loses his life for my sake shall find it.

016:026 Why, what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole
        world but forfeits his life?  Or what shall a man give to buy
        back his life?

016:027 For the Son of Man is soon to come in the glory of the Father
        with His angels, and then will He requite every man according
        to his actions.

016:028 I solemnly tell you that some of those who are standing here
        will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Son
        of Man coming in His Kingdom."

017:001 Six day later, Jesus took with Him Peter and the brothers
        James and John, and brought them up a high mountain to
        a solitary place.

017:002 There in their presence His form underwent a change;
        His face shone like the sun, and His raiment became as white
        as the light.

017:003 And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them conversing with Him.

017:004 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, we are thankful to you that we
        are here.  If you approve, I will put up three tents here,
        one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

017:005 He was still speaking when a luminous cloud spread over them;
        and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said,
        "This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight.
        Listen to Him."

017:006 On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces
        and were filled with terror.

017:007 But Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Rouse yourselves
        and have no fear."

017:008 So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.

017:009 As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them.
        "Tell no one," He said, "of the sight you have seen till
        the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."

017:010 "Why then," asked the disciples, "do the Scribes say that Elijah
        must first come?"

017:011 "Elijah was indeed to come," He replied, "and would
        reform everything.

017:012 But I tell you that he has already come, and they did
        not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose.
        And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them
        in a similar way."

017:013 Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist
        about whom He had spoken to them.

017:014 When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man
        who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.

017:015 "Sir," he said, "have pity on my son, for he is an epileptic
        and is very ill.  Often he falls into the fire and often
        into the water.

017:016 I have brought him to your disciples, and they have not been
        able to cure him."

017:017 "O unbelieving and perverse generation!" replied Jesus;
        "how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you?
        Bring him to me."

017:018 Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him;
        and the boy was cured from that moment.

017:019 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked Him, "Why could
        not we expel the demon?"

017:020 "Because your faith is so small," He replied; "for I solemnly
        declare to you that if you have faith like a mustard-seed,
        you shall say to this mountain, `Remove from this place to that,'
        and it will remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.

017:021 But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by
        prayer and fasting."

017:022 As they were travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them,
        "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;

017:023 they will put Him to death, but on the third day He will be
        raised to life again."  And they were exceedingly distressed.

017:024 After their arrival at Capernaum the collectors of the half-shekel
        came and asked Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay the half-shekel?"

017:025 "Yes," he replied, and then went into the house.  But before
        he spoke a word Jesus said, "What think you, Simon?  From whom
        do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax?
        from their own children, or from others?"

017:026 "From others," he replied.  "Then the children go free," said Jesus.

017:027 "However, lest we cause them to sin, go and throw a hook
        into the Lake, and take the first fish that comes up.
        When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel in it:
        bring that coin and give it to them for yourself and me."

018:001 Just then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who ranks
        higher than others in the Kingdom of the Heavens?"

018:002 So He called a young child to Him, and, bidding him stand
        in the midst of them,

018:003 said, "In solemn truth I tell you that unless you turn and
        become like little children, you will in no case be admitted
        into the Kingdom of the Heavens.

018:004 Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this young child,
        he it is who is superior to others in the Kingdom of the Heavens.

018:005 And whoever for my sake receives one young child such
        as this, receives me.

018:006 But whoever shall occasion the fall of one of these little
        ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have
        a millstone hung round his neck and to be drowned in the depths
        of the sea.

018:007 "Alas for the world because of causes of falling!  They cannot
        but come, but alas for each man through whom they come!

018:008 If your hand or your foot is causing you to fall into sin,
        cut it off and away with it.  It is better for you to enter
        into Life crippled in hand or foot than to remain in possession
        of two sound hands or feet but be thrown into the fire
        of the Ages.

018:009 And if your eye is causing you to fall into sin, tear it out
        and away with it; it is better for you to enter into Life
        with only one eye, than to remain in possession of two eyes
        but be thrown into the Gehenna of fire.

018:010 "Beware of ever despising one of these little ones, for I
        tell you that in Heaven their angels have continual access
        to my Father who is in Heaven.

018:011 []

018:012 What do you yourselves think?  Suppose a man gets a hundred sheep
        and one of them strays away, will he not leave the ninety-nine
        on the hills and go and look for the one that is straying?

018:013 And if he succeeds in finding it, in solemn truth I tell you
        that he rejoices over it more than he does over the ninety-nine
        that have not gone astray.

018:014 Just so it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that one
        of these little ones should be lost.

018:015 "If your brother acts wrongly towards you, go and point
        out his fault to him when only you and he are there.
        If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

018:016 But if he will not listen to you, go again, and ask one or
        two to go with you, that every word spoken may be attested
        by two or three witnesses.

018:017 If he refuses to hear them, appeal to the Church; and if
        he refuses to hear even the Church, regard him just as you
        regard a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.

018:018 I solemnly tell you that whatever you as a Church bind on earth
        will in Heaven be held as bound, and whatever you loose
        on earth will in Heaven be held to be loosed.

018:019 I also solemnly tell you that if two of you here on earth agree
        together concerning anything whatever that they shall ask,
        the boon will come to them from my Father who is in Heaven.

018:020 For where there are two or three assembled in my name,
        there am I in the midst of them."

018:021 At this point Peter came to Him with the question, "Master,
        how often shall my brother act wrongly towards me and I
        forgive him? seven times?"

018:022 "I do not say seven times," answered Jesus, "but seventy
        times seven times.

018:023 "For this reason the Kingdom of the Heavens may be compared
        to a king who determined to have a settlement of accounts
        with his servants.

018:024 But as soon as he began the settlement, one was brought before
        him who owed 10,000 talents,

018:025 and was unable to pay.  So his master ordered that he and his
        wife and children and everything that he had should be sold,
        and payment be made.

018:026 The servant therefore falling down, prostrated himself at
        his feet and entreated him.  "`Only give me time,' he said,
        `and I will pay you the whole.'

018:027 "Whereupon his master, touched with compassion, set him free
        and forgave him the debt.

018:028 But no sooner had that servant gone out, than he met with one
        of his fellow servants who owed him 100 shillings; and seizing
        him by the throat and nearly strangling him he exclaimed,
        "`Pay me all you owe.'

018:029 "His fellow servant therefore fell at his feet and entreated him,
        "`Only give me time,' he said, `and I will pay you.'

018:030 "He would not, however, but went and threw him into prison
        until he should pay what was due.

018:031 His fellow servants, therefore, seeing what had happened,
        were exceedingly angry; and they came and told their master
        without reserve all that had happened.

018:032 At once his master called him and said, "`Wicked servant,
        I forgave you all that debt, because you entreated me:

018:033 ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow servant,
        just as I had pity on you?'

018:034 "So his master, greatly incensed, handed him over to the jailers
        until he should pay all he owed him.

018:035 "In the same way my Heavenly Father will deal with you, if you
        do not all of you forgive one another from your hearts."

019:001 When Jesus had finished these discourses, He removed from Galilee
        and came into that part of Judaea which lay beyond the Jordan.

019:002 And a vast multitude followed him, and He cured them there.

019:003 Then came some of the Pharisees to Him to put Him to the proof
        by the question, "Has a man a right to divorce his wife
        whenever he chooses?"

019:004 "Have you not read," He replied, "that He who made them `made them'
        from the beginning `male and female,

019:005 and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
        and be united to his wife, and the two shall be one'?

019:006 Thus they are no longer two, but `one'!  What therefore God
        has joined together, let not man separate."

019:007 "Why then," said they, "did Moses command the husband to give
        her `a written notice of divorce,' and so put her away?"

019:008 "Moses," He replied, "in consideration of the hardness of your
        nature permitted you to put away your wives, but it has not
        been so from the beginning.

019:009 And I tell you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except
        her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."

019:010 "If this is the case with a man in relation to his wife,"
        said the disciples to Him, "it is better not to marry."

019:011 "It is not every man," He replied, "who can receive this teaching,
        but only those on whom the grace has been bestowed.

019:012 There are men who from their birth have been disabled from marriage,
        others who have been so disabled by men, and others who have
        disabled themselves for the sake of the Kingdom of the Heavens.
        He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."

019:013 Then young children were brought to Him for Him to put His
        hands on them and pray; but the disciples interfered.

019:014 Jesus however said, "Let the little children come to me,
        and do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike
        that the Kingdom of the Heavens belongs."

019:015 So He laid His hands upon them and went away.

019:016 "Teacher," said one man, coming up to Him, "what that is good
        shall I do in order to win the Life of the Ages?"

019:017 "Why do you ask me," He replied, "about what is good?
        There is only One who is truly good.  But if you desire
        to enter into Life, keep the Commandments."

019:018 "Which Commandments?" he asked.  Jesus answered, "`Thou shalt
        not kill;' `Thou shalt not commit adultery;' `Thou shalt not steal;'
        `Thou shalt not lie in giving evidence;'

019:019 `Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Thou shalt love thy
        fellow man as much as thyself.'"

019:020 "All of these," said the young man, "I have carefully kept.
        What do I still lack?"

019:021 "If you desire to be perfect," replied Jesus, "go and sell
        all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have
        wealth in Heaven; and come, follow me."

019:022 On hearing those words the young man went away much cast down;
        for he had much property.

019:023 So Jesus said to His disciples, "I solemnly tell you that it
        is with difficulty that a rich man will enter the Kingdom
        of the Heavens.

019:024 Yes, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye
        of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."

019:025 These words utterly amazed the disciples, and they asked,
        "Who then can be saved?"

019:026 Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible,
        but with God everything is possible."

019:027 Then Peter said to Jesus, "See, *we* have forsaken everything
        and followed you; what then will be *our* reward?"

019:028 "I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that in the New Creation,
        when the Son of Man has taken His seat on His glorious throne,
        all of you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve
        thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

019:029 And whoever has forsaken houses, or brothers or sisters,
        or father or mother, or children or lands, for my sake,
        shall receive many times as much and shall have as his
        inheritance the Life of the Ages.

019:030 "But many who are now first will be last, and many who are
        now last will be first.

020:001 "For the Kingdom of the Heavens is like an employer who went
        out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard,

020:002 and having made an agreement with them for a shilling a day,
        sent them into his vineyard.

020:003 About nine o'clock he went out and saw others loitering
        in the market-place.

020:004 To these also he said, "`You also, go into the vineyard,
        and whatever is right I will give you.'

020:005 "So they went.  Again about twelve, and about three o'clock,
        he went out and did the same.

020:006 And going out about five o'clock he found others loitering,
        and he asked them, "`Why have you been standing here all
        day long, doing nothing?'

020:007 "`Because no one has hired us,' they replied.  "`You also,
        go into the vineyard,' he said.

020:008 "When evening came, the master said to his steward, "`Call the men
        and pay them their wages.  Begin with the last set and finish
        with the first.'

020:009 "When those came who had begun at five o'clock, they received
        a shilling apiece;

020:010 and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they
        also each got the shilling.

020:011 So when they had received it, they grumbled against
        the employer, saying,

020:012 "`These who came last have done only one hour's work, and you
        have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole
        day and have borne the scorching heat.'

020:013 "`My friend,' he answered to one of them, `I am doing you
        no injustice.  Did you not agree with me for a shilling?

020:014 Take your money and go.  I choose to give this last comer
        just as much as I give you.

020:015 Have I not a right to do what I choose with my own property?
        Or are you envious because I am generous?'

020:016 "So the last shall be first, and the first last."

020:017 Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve
        disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,

020:018 "We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man
        will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes.
        They will condemn Him to death,

020:019 and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged
        and crucified; and on the third day He will be raised to life."

020:020 Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons,
        and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.

020:021 "What is it you desire?"  He asked.  "Command," she replied,
        "that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one
        at your left in your Kingdom."

020:022 "None of you know what you are asking for," said Jesus;
        "can you drink out of the cup from which I am about to drink?"
        "We can," they replied.

020:023 "You shall drink out of my cup," He said, "but a seat at my
        right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it
        belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."

020:024 The other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused
        against the two brothers.

020:025 But Jesus called them to Him, and said, "You know that the rulers
        of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise
        authority over them.

020:026 Not so shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great
        among you shall be your servant,

020:027 and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant;

020:028 just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve,
        and to give His life as the redemption-price for many."

020:029 As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,

020:030 two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus
        who was passing by, and cried aloud, "Sir, Son of David, pity us."

020:031 The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all
        the louder.  "O Sir, Son of David, pity us," they said.

020:032 So Jesus stood still and called to them.  "What shall I do
        for you?"  He asked.

020:033 "Sir, let our eyes be opened," they replied.

020:034 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately
        they regained their sight and followed Him.

021:001 When they were come near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage
        and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of the disciples
        on in front,

021:002 saying to them, "Go to the village you see facing you, and as you
        enter it you will find a she-ass tied up and a foal with her.
        Untie her and bring them to me.

021:003 And if any one says anything to you, say, `The Master needs them,'
        and he will at once send them."

021:004 This took place in order that the Prophet's prediction
        might be fulfilled:

021:005 "Tell the Daughter of Zion, `See, thy King is coming to thee,
        gentle, and yet mounted on an ass, even on a colt the foal
        of a beast of burden.'"

021:006 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them:

021:007 they brought the she-ass and the foal, and threw their outer
        garments on them.  So He sat on them;

021:008 and most of the crowd kept spreading their garments along
        the road, while others cut branches from the trees and carpeted
        the road with them,

021:009 and the multitudes--some of the people preceding Him
        and some following--sang aloud, "God save the Son
        of David!  Blessings on Him who comes in the Lord's name!
        God in the highest Heavens save Him!"

021:010 When He thus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was thrown
        into commotion, every one inquiring, "Who is this?"

021:011 "This is Jesus, the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee,"
        replied the crowds.

021:012 Entering the Temple, Jesus drove out all who were buying
        and selling there, and overturned the money-changers'
        tables and the seats of the pigeon-dealers.

021:013 "It is written," He said, "`My House shall be called the House
        of Prayer', but you are making it a robbers' cave."

021:014 And the blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple,
        and He cured them.

021:015 But when the High Priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful
        things that He had done and the children who were crying
        aloud in the Temple, "God save the Son of David," they were
        filled with indignation.

021:016 "Do you hear," they asked Him, "what these children are saying?"
        "Yes," He replied; "have you never read, `Out of the mouths
        of infants and of babes at the breast Thou hast brought forth
        the praise which is due'?"

021:017 So He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and passed
        the night there.

021:018 Early in the morning as He was on His way to return to the city
        He was hungry,

021:019 and seeing a fig-tree on the road-side He went up to it,
        but found nothing on it but leaves.  "On you," He said,
        "no fruit shall ever again grow."  And immediately
        the fig-tree withered away.

021:020 When the disciples saw it they exclaimed in astonishment,
        "How instantaneously the fig-tree has withered away!"

021:021 "I solemnly tell you," said Jesus, "that if you have an
        unwavering faith, you shall not only perform such a miracle
        as this of the fig-tree, but that even if you say to
        this mountain, `Be thou lifted up and hurled into the sea,'
        it shall be done;

021:022 and everything, whatever it be, that you ask for in your prayers,
        if you have faith, you shall obtain."

021:023 He entered the Temple; and while He was teaching,
        the High Priests and the Elders of the people came to Him
        and asked Him, "By what authority are you doing these things?
        and who gave you this authority?"

021:024 "And I also have a question to ask *you*," replied Jesus,
        "and if you answer me, I in turn will tell you by what authority
        I do these things.

021:025 John's Baptism, whence was it?--had it a heavenly or a
        human origin?"  So they debated the matter among themselves.
        "If we say `a heavenly origin,'" they argued, "he will say,
        `Why then did you not believe him?'

021:026 and if we say `a human origin' we have the people to fear,
        for they all hold John to have been a Prophet."

021:027 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."  "Nor do I tell you,"
        He replied, "by what authority I do these things."

021:028 "But give me your judgement.  There was a man who had two sons.
        He came to the elder of them, and said, "`My son, go and work
        in the vineyard to-day.'

021:029 "`I will not,' he replied.  "But afterwards he was sorry, and went.

021:030 He came to the second and spoke in the same manner.
        His answer was, "`I will go, Sir.'  "But he did not go.

021:031 Which of the two did as his father desired?"  "The first," they said.
        "I solemnly tell you,' replied Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers
        and the notorious sinners are entering the Kingdom of God
        in front of you.

021:032 For John came to you observing all sorts of ritual, and you put
        no faith in him:  the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners did
        put faith in him, and you, though you saw this example set you,
        were not even afterwards sorry so as to believe him.

021:033 "Listen to another parable.  There was a householder who planted
        a vineyard, made a fence round it, dug a wine-tank in it,
        and built a strong lodge; then let the place to vine-dressers,
        and went abroad.

021:034 When vintage-time approached, he sent his servants to the
        vine-dressers to receive his share of the grapes;

021:035 but the vine-dressers seized the servants, and one they
        cruelly beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.

021:036 Again he sent another party of servants more numerous than the first;
        and these they treated in the same manner.

021:037 Later still he sent to them his son, saying, "`They will
        respect my son.'

021:038 "But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said to
        one another, "`Here is the heir:  come, let us kill him
        and get his inheritance.'

021:039 "So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard,
        and killed him.

021:040 When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do
        to those vine-dressers?"

021:041 "He will put the wretches to a wretched death," was the reply,
        "and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will
        render the produce to him at the vintage season."

021:042 "Have you never read in the Scriptures," said Jesus, "`The Stone
        which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone:
        this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful
        in our eyes'?

021:043 "That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be
        taken away from you, and given to a nation that will exhibit
        the power of it.

021:044 He who falls on this stone will be severely hurt; but he on
        whom it falls will be utterly crushed."

021:045 After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees
        perceived that He was speaking about them;

021:046 but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid
        of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet.

022:001 Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.

022:002 "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "may be compared
        to a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,

022:003 and sent his servants to call the invited guests to the wedding,
        but they were unwilling to come.

022:004 "Again he sent other servants with a message to those who
        were invited.  "`My breakfast is now ready," he said, `my bullocks
        and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made:
        come to the wedding.'

022:005 "They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country,
        another to his business;

022:006 and the rest seized the king's servants, maltreated them,
        and murdered them.

022:007 So the king's anger was stirred, and he sent his troops
        and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.

022:008 Then he said to his servants, "`The wedding banquet is ready,
        but those who were invited were unworthy of it.

022:009 Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet
        invite to the wedding.'

022:010 "So they went out into the roads and gathered together all
        they could find, both bad and good, and the banqueting hall
        was filled with guests.

022:011 "Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them
        he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.

022:012 "`My friend,' he said, `how is it that you came in here without
        a wedding robe?'

022:013 "The man stood speechless.  Then the king said to the servants,
        "`Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside:
        there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.'

022:014 "For there are many called, but few chosen."

022:015 Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might
        entrap Him in His conversation.

022:016 So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians;
        who said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you
        faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you,
        for you are not biased by men's wealth or rank.

022:017 Give us your judgement therefore:  is it allowable for us
        to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"

022:018 Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, "Why are you
        hypocrites trying to ensnare me?

022:019 Show me the tribute coin."  And they brought Him a shilling.

022:020 "Whose likeness and inscription," He asked, "is this?"

022:021 "Caesar's," they replied.  "Pay therefore," He rejoined,
        "what is Caesar's to Caesar; and what is God's to God."

022:022 They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him,
        and went their way.

022:023 On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that
        there is no resurrection.  And they put this case to Him.

022:024 "Teacher," they said, "Moses enjoined, `If a man die childless,
        his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'

022:025 Now we had among us seven brothers.  The eldest of them married,
        but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.

022:026 So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,

022:027 till the woman also died, after surviving them all.

022:028 At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will
        she be? for they all married her."

022:029 The reply of Jesus was, "You are in error, through ignorance
        of the Scriptures and of the power of God.

022:030 For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given
        in marriage, but they are like angels in Heaven.

022:031 But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read
        what God says to you,

022:032 `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
        of Jacob'?  He is not the God of dead, but of living men."

022:033 All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement
        at His teaching.

022:034 Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He had
        silenced the Sadducees,

022:035 and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as
        a test question,

022:036 "Teacher, which is the greatest Commandment in the Law?"

022:037 "`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'" He answered, "`with thy
        whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.'

022:038 This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.

022:039 And the second is similar to it:  `Thou shalt love thy fellow
        man as much as thyself.'

022:040 The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in
        these two Commandments."

022:041 While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put
        a question to them.

022:042 "What think you about the Christ," He said, "whose son
        is He?"  "David's," they replied.

022:043 "How then," He asked, "does David, taught by the Spirit,
        call Him Lord, when he says,

022:044 "`The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I
        have put thy foes beneath thy feet'?

022:045 "If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?"

022:046 No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any
        one venture again to put a question to Him.

023:001 Then Jesus addressed the crowds and His disciples.

023:002 "The Scribes," He said, "and the Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses.

023:003 Therefore do and observe everything that they command you;
        but do not imitate their lives, for though they tell others
        what to do, they do not do it themselves.

023:004 Heavy and cumbrous burdens they bind together and load men's
        shoulders with them, while as for themselves, not with one
        finger do they choose to lift them.

023:005 And everything they do they do with a view to being observed by men;
        for they widen their phylacteries and make the tassels large,

023:006 and love the best seats at a dinner party or in the synagogues,

023:007 and like to be bowed to in places of public resort, and to be
        addressed by men as `Rabbi.'

023:008 "As for you, do not accept the title of `Rabbi,' for one alone
        is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.

023:009 And call no one on earth your Father, for One alone is your Father--
        the Heavenly Father.

023:010 And do not accept the name of `leader,' for your Leader is
        one alone--the Christ.

023:011 He who is the greatest among you shall be your servant;

023:012 and one who exalts himself shall be abased, while one who abases
        himself shall be exalted.

023:013 "But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
        lock the door of the Kingdom of the Heavens against men;
        you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter
        who are seeking to do so.

023:014 []

023:015 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you scour
        sea and land in order to win one convert--and when he is gained,
        you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.

023:016 "Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, "`Whoever swears
        by the Sanctuary it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold
        of the Sanctuary, is bound by the oath.'

023:017 "Blind fools!  Why, which is greater?--the gold, or the Sanctuary
        which has made the gold holy?

023:018 And you say, "`Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing;
        but whoever swears by the offering lying on it is bound
        by the oath.'

023:019 "You are blind!  Why, which is greater?--the offering,
        or the altar which makes the offering holy?

023:020 He who swears by the altar swears both by it and by everything on it;

023:021 he who swears by the Sanctuary swears both by it and by Him
        who dwells in it;

023:022 and he who swears by Heaven swears both by the throne of God
        and by Him who sits upon it.

023:023 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay
        the tithe on mint, dill, and cumin, while you have neglected
        the weightier requirements of the Law--just judgement, mercy,
        and faithful dealing.  These things you ought to have done,
        and yet you ought not to have left the others undone.

023:024 You blind guides, straining out the gnat while you gulp
        down the camel!

023:025 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
        wash clean the outside of the cup or dish, while within they
        are full of greed and self-indulgence.

023:026 Blind Pharisee, first wash clean the inside of the cup or dish,
        and then the outside will be clean also.

023:027 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are
        just like whitewashed sepulchres, the outside of which pleases
        the eye, though inside they are full of dead men's bones
        and of all that is unclean.

023:028 The same is true of you:  outwardly you seem to the human
        eye to be good and honest men, but, within, you are full
        of insincerity and disregard of God's Law.

023:029 "Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you repair
        the sepulchres of the Prophets and keep in order the tombs
        of the righteous,

023:030 and your boast is, "`If we had lived in the time of our forefathers,
        we should not have been implicated with them in the murder
        of the Prophets.'

023:031 "So that you bear witness against yourselves that you are
        descendants of those who murdered the Prophets.

023:032 Fill up the measure of your forefathers' guilt.

023:033 O serpents, O vipers' brood, how are you to escape
        condemnation to Gehenna?

023:034 "For this reason I am sending to you Prophets and wise men
        and Scribes.  Some of them you will put to death--nay, crucify;
        some of them you will flog in your synagogues and chase
        from town to town;

023:035 that all the innocent blood shed upon earth may come on you,
        from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah
        the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the Sanctuary
        and the altar.

023:036 I tell you in solemn truth that all these things will come
        upon the present generation.

023:037 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! thou who murderest the Prophets
        and stonest those who have been sent to thee! how often have I
        desired to gather thy children to me, just as a hen gathers
        her chickens under her wings, and you would not come!

023:038 See, your house will now be left to you desolate!

023:039 For I tell you that you will never see me again until you say,
        `Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord.'"

024:001 Jesus had left the Temple and was going on His way, when His
        disciples came and called His attention to the Temple buildings.

024:002 "You see all these?"  He replied; "in solemn truth I tell
        you that there will not be left here one stone upon another
        that will not be pulled down."

024:003 Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there
        when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others,
        and said, "Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign
        of your Coming and of the Close of the Age?"

024:004 "Take care that no one misleads you," answered Jesus;

024:005 "for many will come assuming my name and saying `I am the Christ;'
        and they will mislead many.

024:006 And before long you will hear of wars and rumours of wars.
        Do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the End
        is not yet.

024:007 For nation will rise in arms against nation, kingdom against kingdom,
        and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places;

024:008 but all these miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.

024:009 "At that time they will deliver you up to punishment and will
        put you to death; and you will be objects of hatred to all
        the nations because you are called by my name.

024:010 Then will many stumble and fall, and they will betray one
        another and hate one another.

024:011 Many false prophets will rise up and lead multitudes astray;

024:012 and because of the prevalent disregard of God's law the love
        of the great majority will grow cold;

024:013 but those who stand firm to the End shall be saved.

024:014 And this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout
        the whole world to set the evidence before all the Gentiles;
        and then the End will come.

024:015 "When you have seen (to use the language of the Prophet Daniel)
        the `Abomination of Desolation', standing in the Holy Place"--
        let the reader observe those words--

024:016 "then let those who are in Judaea escape to the hills;

024:017 let him who is on the roof not go down to fetch what is
        in his house;

024:018 nor let him who is outside the city stay to pick up
        his outer garment.

024:019 And alas for the women who at that time are with child
        or have infants!

024:020 "But pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on the Sabbath;

024:021 for it will be a time of great suffering, such as never has
        been from the beginning of the world till now, and assuredly
        never will be again.

024:022 And if those days had not been cut short, no one would escape;
        but for the sake of God's own People those days will be cut short.

024:023 "If at that time any one should say to you, `See, here is
        the Christ!' or `Here!' give no credence to it.

024:024 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets,
        displaying wonderful signs and prodigies, so as to deceive,
        were it possible, even God's own People.

024:025 Remember, I have forewarned you.

024:026 If therefore they should say to you, `See, He is in the Desert!'
        do not go out there:  or `See, He is indoors in the room!'
        do not believe it.

024:027 For just as the lightning flashes in the east and is seen
        to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man.

024:028 Wherever the dead body is, there will the vultures flock together.

024:029 "But immediately after those times of distress the sun will
        be darkened, the moon will not shed her light, the stars
        will fall from the firmament, and the forces which control
        the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.

024:030 Then will appear the Sign of the Son of Man in the sky;
        and then will all the nations of the earth lament, when they
        see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great
        power and glory.

024:031 And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet-blast,
        and they will bring together His own People to Him from north,
        south, east and west--from one extremity of the world
        to the other.

024:032 "Now learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches.
        As soon as its branches have now become soft and it is bursting
        into leaf, you all know that summer is near.

024:033 So you also, when you see all these signs, may be sure that He
        is near--at your very door.

024:034 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will
        certainly not pass away without all these things having
        first taken place.

024:035 Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words
        will not pass away.

024:036 "But as to that day and the exact time no one knows--not even
        the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.

024:037 `For as it was in the time of Noah, so it will be at the Coming
        of the Son of Man.

024:038 At that time, before the Deluge, men were busy eating and drinking,
        taking wives or giving them, up to the very day when Noah
        entered the Ark,

024:039 nor did they realise any danger till the Deluge came and swept
        them all away; so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.

024:040 Then will two men be in the open country:  one will be taken away,
        and one left behind.

024:041 Two women will be grinding at the mill:  one will be taken away,
        and one left behind.

024:042 Be on the alert therefore, for you do not know the day on
        which your Lord is coming.

024:043 But of this be assured, that if the master of the house had known
        the hour at which the robber was coming, he would have kept awake,
        and not have allowed his house to be broken into.

024:044 Therefore you also must be ready; for it is at a time when you
        do not expect Him that the Son of Man will come.

024:045 "Who therefore is the loyal and intelligent servant to whom
        his master has entrusted the control of his household to give
        them their rations at the appointed time?

024:046 Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes shall
        find so doing!

024:047 In solemn truth I tell you that he will give him the management
        of all his wealth.

024:048 But if the man, being a bad servant, should say in his heart,
        `My master is a long time in coming,'

024:049 and should begin to beat his fellow servants, while he eats
        and drinks with drunkards;

024:050 the master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not
        expecting him and at an hour of which he has not been informed;

024:051 he will treat him with the utmost severity and assign him
        a place among the hypocrites:  there will be the weeping
        and the gnashing of teeth.

025:001 "Then will the Kingdom of the Heavens be found to be like
        ten bridesmaids who took their torches and went out to
        meet the bridegroom.

025:002 Five of them were foolish and five were wise.

025:003 For the foolish, when they took their torches, did not provide
        themselves with oil;

025:004 but the wise, besides their torches, took oil in their flasks.

025:005 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, so that meanwhile
        they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

025:006 But at midnight there is a loud cry, "`The bridegroom!
        Go out and meet him!'

025:007 "Then all those bridesmaids roused themselves and
        trimmed their torches.

025:008 "`Give us some of your oil,' said the foolish ones to the wise,
        `for our torches are going out.'

025:009 "`But perhaps,' replied the wise, `there will not be enough for all
        of us.  Go to the shops rather, and buy some for yourselves.'

025:010 "So they went to buy.  But meanwhile the bridegroom came;
        those bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the
        wedding banquet; and the door was shut.

025:011 "Afterwards the other bridesmaids came and cried, "`Sir, Sir,
        open the door to us.'

025:012 "`In solemn truth I tell you,' he replied, `I do not know you.'

025:013 "Keep awake therefore; for you know neither the day nor the hour.

025:014 "Why, it is like a man who, when going on his travels,
        called his bondservants and entrusted his property to their care.

025:015 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one--
        to each according to his individual capacity; and then
        started from home.

025:016 Without delay the one who had received the five talents went
        and employed them in business, and gained five more.

025:017 In the same way he who had the two gained two more.

025:018 But the man who had received the one went and dug a hole
        and buried his master's money.

025:019 "After a long lapse of time the master of those servants returned,
        and had a reckoning with them.

025:020 The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more,
        and said, "`Sir, it was five talents that you entrusted to me:
        see, I have gained five more.'

025:021 "`You have done well, good and trustworthy servant,'
        replied his master; `you have been trustworthy in the
        management of a little, I will put you in charge of much:
        share your master's joy.'

025:022 "The second, who had received the two talents, came and said,
        "`Sir, it was two talents you entrusted to me:  see, I have
        gained two more.'

025:023 "`Good and trustworthy servant, you have done well,'
        his master replied; `you have been trustworthy in the
        management of a little, I will put you in charge of much:
        share your master's joy.'

025:024 "But, next, the man who had the one talent in his keeping came
        and said, "`Sir, I knew you to be a severe man, reaping where
        you had not sown and garnering what you had not winnowed.

025:025 So being afraid I went and buried your talent in the ground:
        there you have what belongs to you.'

025:026 "`You wicked and slothful servant,' replied his master,
        `did you know that I reap where I have not sown, and garner
        what I have not winnowed?

025:027 Your duty then was to deposit my money in some bank, and so when I
        came I should have got back my property with interest.

025:028 So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man
        who has the ten.'

025:029 (For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall
        have abundance; but from him who has nothing, even what he has
        shall be taken away.)

025:030 `But as for this worthless servant, put him out into
        the darkness outside:  *there* will be the weeping and
        the gnashing of teeth.'

025:031 "When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels
        with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne,

025:032 and all the nations will be gathered into His presence.
        And He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd
        separates the sheep from the goats;

025:033 and will make the sheep stand at His right hand, and the goats
        at His left.

025:034 "Then the King will say to those at His right, "`Come, my Father's
        blessed ones, receive your inheritance of the Kingdom which
        has been divinely intended for you ever since the creation
        of the world.

025:035 For when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty,
        you gave me drink; when I was homeless, you gave me a welcome;

025:036 when I was ill-clad, you clothed me; when I was sick,
        you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to see me.'

025:037 "`When, Lord,' the righteous will reply, `did we see Thee hungry,
        and feed Thee; or thirsty, and give Thee drink?

025:038 When did we see Thee homeless, and give Thee a welcome? or ill-clad,
        and clothe Thee?

025:039 When did we see Thee sick or in prison, and come to see Thee?'

025:040 "But the King will answer them, "`In solemn truth I tell you that
        in so far as you rendered such services to one of the humblest
        of these my brethren, you rendered them to myself.'

025:041 "Then will He say to those at His left, "`Begone from me,
        with the curse resting upon you, into the Fire of the Ages,
        which has been prepared for the Devil and his angels.

025:042 For when I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat; when thirsty,
        you gave me nothing to drink;

025:043 when homeless, you gave me no welcome; ill-clad, you clothed me not;
        sick or in prison, you visited me not.'

025:044 "Then will they also answer, "`Lord, when did we see Thee hungry
        or thirsty or homeless or ill-clad or sick or in prison,
        and not come to serve Thee?'

025:045 "But he will reply, "`In solemn truth I tell you that in so far
        as you withheld such services from one of the humblest of these,
        you withheld them from me.'

025:046 "And these shall go away into the Punishment of the Ages,
        but the righteous into the Life of the Ages."

026:001 When Jesus had ended all these discourses, He said to His disciples,

026:002 "You know that in two days' time the Passover comes.
        And the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."

026:003 Then the High Priests and Elders of the People assembled
        in the court of the palace of the High Priest Caiaphas,

026:004 and consulted how to get Jesus into their power by stratagem
        and put Him to death.

026:005 But they said, "Not during the Festival, lest there be a riot
        among the people."

026:006 Now when Jesus was come to Bethany and was at the house
        of Simon the Leper,

026:007 a woman came to Him with a jar of very costly, sweet-scented ointment,
        which she poured over His head as He reclined at table.

026:008 "Why such waste?" indignantly exclaimed the disciples;

026:009 "for this might have been sold for a considerable sum,
        and the money given to the poor."

026:010 But Jesus heard it, and said to them, "Why are you vexing her?
        For she has done a most gracious act towards me.

026:011 The poor you always have with you, but me you have not always.

026:012 In pouring this ointment over me, her object was to prepare
        me for burial.

026:013 In solemn truth I tell you that wherever in the whole world
        this Good News shall be proclaimed, this deed of hers shall
        be spoken of in memory of her."

026:014 At that time one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot,
        went to the High Priests

026:015 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?"
        So they weighed out to him thirty shekels,

026:016 and from that moment he was on the look out for an opportunity
        to betray Him.

026:017 On the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came
        to Jesus with the question, "Where shall we make preparations
        for you to eat the Passover?"

026:018 "Go into the city," He replied, "to a certain man, and tell him,
        `The Teacher says, My time is close at hand.  It is at your
        house that I shall keep the Passover with my disciples.'"

026:019 The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and got the Passover ready.

026:020 When evening came, He was at table with the twelve disciples,

026:021 and the meal was proceeding, when Jesus said, "In solemn truth
        I tell you that one of you will betray me."

026:022 Intensely grieved they began one after another to ask Him, "Can it
        be I, Master?"

026:023 "The one who has dipped his fingers in the bowl with me,"
        He answered, "is the man who will betray me.

026:024 The Son of Man is indeed going as is written concerning Him;
        but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
        It had been a happy thing for that man if he had never been born."

026:025 Then Judas, the disciple who was betraying Him, asked, "Can it
        be I, Rabbi?"  "It is you," He replied.

026:026 During the meal Jesus took a Passover biscuit, blessed it and
        broke it.  He then gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this
        and eat it:  it is my body."

026:027 And He took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying,
        "Drink from it, all of you;

026:028 for this is my blood which is to be poured out for many for
        the remission of sins--the blood which ratifies the Covenant.

026:029 I tell you that I will never again take the produce of the vine
        till that day when I shall drink the new wine with you
        in my Father's Kingdom."

026:030 So they sang the hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.

026:031 Then said Jesus, "This night all of you will stumble and fail
        in your fidelity to me; for it is written, `I will strike
        the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
        in all directions.'

026:032 But after I have risen to life again I will go before
        you into Galilee."

026:033 "All may stumble and fail," said Peter, "but I never will."

026:034 "In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that this very night,
        before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."

026:035 "Even if I must die with you," declared Peter, "I will never
        disown you."  In like manner protested all the disciples.

026:036 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane.
        And He said to the disciples, "Sit down here, whilst I go
        yonder and there pray."

026:037 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zabdi.
        Then He began to be full of anguish and distress,

026:038 and He said to them, "My soul is crushed with anguish to
        the very point of death; wait here, and keep awake with me."

026:039 Going forward a short distance He fell on His face and prayed.
        "My Father," He said, "if it is possible, let this cup pass away
        from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou willest."

026:040 Then He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and He
        said to Peter, "Alas, none of you could keep awake with me
        for even a single hour!

026:041 Keep awake, and pray that you may not enter into temptation:
        the spirit is right willing, but the body is frail."

026:042 Again a second time He went away and prayed, saying, "My Father,
        if it is impossible for this cup to pass without my drinking it,
        Thy will be done."

026:043 He came and again found them asleep, for they were very tired.

026:044 So He left them, and went away once more and prayed a third time,
        again using the same words.

026:045 Then He came to the disciples and said, "Sleep on and rest.
        See, the moment is close at hand when the Son of Man is to be
        betrayed into the hands of sinful men.

026:046 Rouse yourselves.  Let us be going.  My betrayer is close at hand."

026:047 He had scarcely finished speaking when Judas came--
        one of the Twelve--accompanied by a great crowd of men armed
        with swords and bludgeons, sent by the High Priests and Elders
        of the People.

026:048 Now the betrayer had agreed upon a sign with them, to direct them.
        He had said, "The one whom I kiss is the man:
        lay hold of him."

026:049 So he went straight to Jesus and said, "Peace to you, Rabbi!"  And he
        kissed Him eagerly.

026:050 "Friend," said Jesus, "carry out your intention."  Then they
        came and laid their hands on Jesus and seized Him firmly.

026:051 But one of those with Jesus drew his sword and struck
        the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear.

026:052 "Put back your sword again," said Jesus, "for all who draw
        the sword shall perish by the sword.

026:053 Or do you suppose I cannot entreat my Father and He would
        instantly send to my help more than twelve legions of angels?

026:054 In that case how are the Scriptures to be fulfilled which declare
        that thus it must be?"

026:055 Then said Jesus to the crowds, "Have you come out as if to fight
        with a robber, with swords and bludgeons to apprehend me?
        Day after day I have been sitting teaching in the Temple,
        and you did not arrest me.

026:056 But all this has taken place in order that the writings of
        the Prophets may be fulfilled."  At this point the disciples
        all left Him and fled.

026:057 But the officers who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away
        to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the Scribes
        and the Elders had assembled.

026:058 And Peter kept following Him at a distance, till he came even
        to the court of the High Priest's palace, where he entered
        and sat down among the officers to see the issue.

026:059 Meanwhile the High Priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking
        false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death;

026:060 but they could find none, although many false witnesses came forward.
        At length there came two

026:061 who testified, "This man said, `I am able to pull down the Sanctuary
        of God and three days afterwards to build a new one.'"

026:062 Then the High Priest stood up and asked Him, "Have you
        no answer to make?  What is it these men are saying in
        evidence against you?"

026:063 Jesus however remained silent.  Again the High Priest addressed Him.
        "In the name of the ever-living God," he said, "I now put
        you on your oath.  Tell us whether you are the Christ,
        the Son of God."

026:064 "I am He," replied Jesus.  "But I tell you that, later on,
        you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
        of Omnipotence, and coming on the clouds of the sky."

026:065 Then the High Priest tore his robes and exclaimed, "Impious language!
        What further need have we of witnesses!  See, you have now
        heard the impiety.

026:066 What is your verdict?"  "He deserves to die," they replied.

026:067 Then they spat in His face, and struck Him--some with the fist,
        some with the open hand--

026:068 while they taunted Him, saying, "Christ, prove yourself
        a Prophet by telling us who it was that struck you."

026:069 Peter meanwhile was sitting outside in the court of the palace,
        when one of the maidservants came over to him and said,
        "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."

026:070 He denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know
        what you mean."

026:071 Soon afterwards he went out and stood in the gateway,
        when another girl saw him, and said, addressing the people there,
        "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."

026:072 Again he denied it with an oath.  "I do not know the man," he said.

026:073 A short time afterwards the people standing there came
        and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them,
        for your brogue shows it."

026:074 Then with curses and oaths he declared, "I do not know the man."
        Immediately a cock crowed,

026:075 and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, how He had said,
        "Before the cock crows you will three times disown me."
        And he went out and wept aloud, bitterly.

027:001 When morning came all the High Priests and the Elders of the people
        consulted together against Jesus to put Him to death;

027:002 and binding Him they led Him away and handed Him over to
        Pilate the Governor.

027:003 Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He was condemned,
        smitten with remorse he brought back the thirty shekels
        to the High Priests and Elders

027:004 and said, "I have sinned, in betraying to death one who
        is innocent."  "What does that matter to us?" they replied;
        it is your business."

027:005 Flinging the shekels into the Sanctuary he left the place,
        and went and hanged himself.

027:006 When the High Priests had gathered up the money they said,
        "It is illegal to put it into the Treasury, because it is
        the price of blood."

027:007 So after consulting together they spent the money in the purchase
        of the Potter's Field as a burial place for people not belonging
        to the city;

027:008 for which reason that piece of ground received the name,
        which it still bears, of `the Field of Blood.'

027:009 Then were fulfilled the words spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah, "And I
        took the thirty shekels, the price of the prized one on whom
        Israelites had set a price,

027:010 and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."

027:011 Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Governor, and the latter
        put the question, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  "I am
        their King," He answered.

027:012 When however the High Priests and the Elders kept bringing
        their charges against Him, He said not a word in reply.

027:013 "Do you not hear," asked Pilate, "what a mass of evidence they
        are bringing against you?"

027:014 But He made no reply to a single accusation, so that the Governor
        was greatly astonished.

027:015 "Now it was the Governor's custom at the Festival to release
        some one prisoner, whomsoever the populace desired;

027:016 and at this time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

027:017 So when they were now assembled Pilate appealed to them.
        "Whom shall I release to you," he said, "Barabbas, or Jesus
        the so-called Christ?"

027:018 For he knew that it was from envious hatred that Jesus had been
        brought before him.

027:019 While he was sitting on the tribunal a message came to him
        from his wife.  "Have nothing to do with that innocent man,"
        she said, "for during the night I have suffered terribly
        in a dream through him."

027:020 The High Priests, however, and the Elders urged the crowd
        to ask for Barabbas and to demand the death of Jesus.

027:021 So when the Governor a second time asked them, "Which of the two
        shall I release to you?"--they cried, "Barabbas!"

027:022 "What then," said Pilate, "shall I do with Jesus,
        the so-called Christ?"  With one voice they shouted,
        "Let him be crucified!"

027:023 "Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.
        But they kept on furiously shouting, "Let him be crucified!"

027:024 So when he saw that he could gain nothing, but that on the contrary
        there was a riot threatening, he called for water and washed
        his hands in sight of them all, saying, "I am not responsible
        for this murder:  you must answer for it."

027:025 "His blood," replied all the people, "be on us and on our children!"

027:026 Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he ordered
        to be scourged, and gave Him up to be crucified.

027:027 Then the Governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium,
        and called together the whole battalion to make sport of Him.

027:028 Stripping off His garments, they put on Him a general's
        short crimson cloak.

027:029 They twisted a wreath of thorny twigs and put it on His head,
        and they put a sceptre of cane in His right hand, and kneeling
        to Him they shouted in mockery, "Long live the King of the Jews!"

027:030 Then they spat upon Him, and taking the cane they repeatedly
        struck Him on the head with it.

027:031 At last, having finished their sport, they took off the cloak,
        clothed Him again in His own garments, and led Him
        away for crucifixion.

027:032 Going out they met a Cyrenaean named Simon; whom they compelled
        to carry His cross,

027:033 and so they came to a place called Golgotha,
        which means `Skull-ground.'

027:034 Here they gave Him a mixture of wine and gall to drink,
        but having tasted it He refused to drink it.

027:035 After crucifying Him, they divided His garments among them by lot,

027:036 and sat down there on guard.

027:037 Over His head they placed a written statement of the charge
        against Him:  THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

027:038 At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him,
        one at His right hand and the other at His left.

027:039 And the passers-by reviled Him.  They shook their heads at Him

027:040 and said, "You who would pull down the Sanctuary and build a new
        one within three days, save yourself.  If you are God's Son,
        come down from the cross."

027:041 In like manner the High Priests also, together with the Scribes
        and the Elders, taunted Him.

027:042 "He saved others," they said, "himself he cannot save!
        He is the King of Israel!  Let him now come down from the cross,
        and we will believe in him.

027:043 His trust is in God:  let God deliver him now, if He will have him;
        for he said, `I am God's Son.'"

027:044 Insults of the same kind were heaped on Him even by the robbers
        who were being crucified with Him.

027:045 Now from noon until three o'clock in the afternoon there was
        darkness over the whole land;

027:046 but about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
        "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, My God,
        why hast Thou forsaken me?"

027:047 "The man is calling for Elijah," said some of the bystanders.

027:048 One of them ran forthwith, and filling a sponge with sour wine
        put it on the end of a cane and offered it Him to drink;

027:049 while the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah is coming
        to deliver him."

027:050 But Jesus uttered another loud cry and then yielded up His spirit.

027:051 Immediately the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from
        top to bottom:  the earth quaked; the rocks split;

027:052 the tombs opened; and many of God's people who were asleep
        in death awoke.

027:053 And coming out of their tombs after Christ's resurrection they
        entered the holy city and showed themselves to many.

027:054 As for the Captain and the soldiers who were with Him keeping
        guard over Jesus, when they witnessed the earthquake
        and the other occurrences they were filled with terror,
        and exclaimed, "Assuredly he was God's Son."

027:055 And there were a number of women there looking on from
        a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering
        to His necessities;

027:056 among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James
        and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zabdi.

027:057 Towards sunset there came a wealthy inhabitant of Arimathaea,
        named Joseph, who himself also had become a disciple of Jesus.

027:058 He went to Pilate and begged to have the body of Jesus,
        and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.

027:059 So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet
        of fine linen.

027:060 He then laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn in the
        solid rock, and after rolling a great stone against the door
        of the tomb he went home.

027:061 Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were both present there,
        sitting opposite to the sepulchre.

027:062 On the next day, the day after the Preparation, the High Priests
        and the Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.

027:063 "Sir," they said, "we recollect that during his lifetime
        that impostor pretended that after two days he was to rise
        to life again.

027:064 So give orders for the sepulchre to be securely guarded till
        the third day, for fear his disciples should come by night
        and steal the body, and then tell the people that he has come
        back to life; and so the last imposture will be more serious
        than the first."

027:065 "You can have a guard," said Pilate:  "go and make all safe,
        as best you can."

027:066 So they went and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone
        besides setting the guard.

028:001 After the Sabbath, in the early dawn of the first day of the week,
        Mary of Magdala and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre.

028:002 But to their amazement there had been a great earthquake;
        for an angel of the Lord had descended from Heaven, and had
        come and rolled back the stone, and was sitting upon it.

028:003 His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.

028:004 For fear of him the guards trembled violently, and became
        like dead men.

028:005 But the angel said to the women, "As for you, dismiss your fears.
        I know that it is Jesus that you are looking for--
        the crucified One.

028:006 He is not here:  He has come back to life, as He foretold.
        Come and see the place where He lay.

028:007 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen
        from the dead and is going before you into Galilee:
        there you shall see Him.  Remember, I have told you."

028:008 They quickly left the tomb and ran, still terrified but full
        of unspeakable joy, to carry the news to His disciples.

028:009 And then suddenly they saw Jesus coming to meet them.
        "Peace be to you," He said.  And they came and clasped His feet,
        bowing to the ground before Him.

028:010 Then He said, "Dismiss all fear!  Go and take word to my brethren
        to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me."

028:011 While they went on this errand, some of the guards came
        into the city and reported to the High Priests every detail
        of what had happened.

028:012 So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after
        consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,

028:013 telling them to say, "His disciples came during the night
        and stole his body while we were asleep."

028:014 "And if this," they added, "is reported to the Governor,
        we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."

028:015 So they took the money and did as they were instructed;
        and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current
        to this day.

028:016 As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee,
        to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.

028:017 There they saw Him and prostrated themselves before Him.
        Yet some doubted.

028:018 Jesus however came near and said to them, "All power in Heaven
        and over the earth has been given to me.

028:019 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations;
        baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son,
        and of the Holy Spirit;

028:020 and teach them to obey every command which I have given you.
        And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the Close
        of the Age."

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
