005:001 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was
        the firstborn; but, because he defiled his father's couch,
        his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel;
        and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the prince;
        but the birthright was Joseph's:)

005:008 and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
        who lived in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baal Meon:
005:009 and eastward he lived even to the entrance of the wilderness
        from the river Euphrates, because their livestock were multiplied
        in the land of Gilead.
005:010 In the days of Saul, they made war with the Hagrites, who fell
        by their hand; and they lived in their tents throughout all
        the [land] east of Gilead.
005:011 The sons of Gad lived over against them, in the land of
        Bashan to Salecah:

        thousand seven hundred and sixty, that were able to go
        forth to war.
005:019 They made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.
005:020 They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered
        into their hand, and all who were with them; for they
        cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them,
        because they put their trust in him.
005:021 They took away their livestock; of their camels fifty thousand,
        and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys

005:025 They trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played
        the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the land,
        whom God destroyed before them.
005:026 The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria,
        and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria,
        and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah,

        and Saul became the father of Jonathan, and Malchishua,
        and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
008:034 The son of Jonathan was Merib Baal; and Merib Baal became
        the father of Micah.
008:035 The sons of Micah:  Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz.
008:036 Ahaz became the father of Jehoaddah; and Jehoaddah became
        the father of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri
        became the father of Moza.
008:037 Moza became the father of Binea; Raphah was his son,
        Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
008:038 Azel had six sons, whose names are these:  Azrikam, Bocheru,
        and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan.
        All these were the sons of Azel.
008:039 The sons of Eshek his brother:  Ulam his firstborn,
        Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third.
008:040 The sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers,
        and had many sons, and sons' sons, one hundred fifty.
        All these were of the sons of Benjamin.
009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold,
        they are written in the book of the kings of Israel:  and Judah
        was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience.
009:002 Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions
        in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites,
        and the Nethinim.
009:003 In Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah, and of the children
        of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh:
009:004 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri,
        the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah.
009:005 Of the Shilonites:  Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.
009:006 Of the sons of Zerah:  Jeuel, and their brothers,
        six hundred ninety.
009:007 Of the sons of Benjamin:  Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son
        of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah,
009:008 and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi,
        the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah,
        the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;
009:009 and their brothers, according to their generations,
        nine hundred fifty-six. All these men were heads of fathers'
        [houses] by their fathers' houses.
009:010 Of the priests:  Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, Jachin,
009:011 and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam,
        the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub,
        the ruler of the house of God;
009:012 and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son
        of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,
        the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;
009:013 and their brothers, heads of their fathers' houses, one thousand
        seven hundred sixty; very able men for the work of the service
        of the house of God.
009:014 Of the Levites:  Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam,
        the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
009:015 and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica,
        the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph,
009:016 and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son
        of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
        who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.
009:017 The porters:  Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman,
        and their brothers (Shallum was the chief),
009:018 who hitherto [waited] in the king's gate eastward:
        they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi.
009:019 Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah,
        and his brothers, of his father's house, the Korahites, were over
        the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent:
        and their fathers had been over the camp of Yahweh,
        keepers of the entry.
009:020 Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past,
        [and] Yahweh was with him.
009:021 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door
        of the tent of meeting.
009:022 All these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds
        were two hundred and twelve.  These were reckoned by genealogy
        in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
        in their office of trust.
009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates
        of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the tent, by wards.
009:024 On the four sides were the porters, toward the east,
        west, north, and south.
009:025 Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven
        days from time to time to be with them:
009:026 for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in an office
        of trust, and were over the chambers and over the treasuries
        in the house of God.
009:027 They lodged round about the house of God, because the charge
        [of it] was on them; and to them pertained the opening of it
        morning by morning.
009:028 Certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by count
        were these brought in and by count were these taken out.
009:029 Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over
        all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour,
        and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
009:030 Some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection
        of the spices.
009:031 Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum
        the Korahite, had the office of trust over the things that
        were baked in pans.
009:032 Some of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites,
        were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
009:033 These are the singers, heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites,
        [who lived] in the chambers [and were] free [from other service];
        for they were employed in their work day and night.
009:034 These were heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites,
        throughout their generations, chief men:  these lived at Jerusalem.
009:035 In Gibeon there lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's
        name was Maacah:
009:036 and his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal,
        and Ner, and Nadab,
009:037 and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
009:038 Mikloth became the father of Shimeam.  They also lived with
        their brothers in Jerusalem, over against their brothers.
009:039 Ner became the father of Kish; and Kish became the father of Saul;
        and Saul became the father of Jonathan, and Malchishua,
        and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
009:040 The son of Jonathan was Merib Baal; and Merib Baal became
        the father of Micah.
009:041 The sons of Micah:  Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, [and Ahaz].
009:042 Ahaz became the father of Jarah; and Jarah became the father
        of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri became
        the father of Moza;
009:043 and Moza became the father of Binea; and Rephaiah his son,
        Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
009:044 Azel had six sons, whose names are these:  Azrikam, Bocheru,
        and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
        these were the sons of Azel.
010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel:  and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        on Mount Gilboa.
010:002 The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons;
        and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua,
        the sons of Saul.
010:003 The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him;
        and he was distressed by reason of the archers.
010:004 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me
        through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.
        But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid.
        Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.
010:005 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell
        on his sword, and died.
010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.
010:007 When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled,
        and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities,
        and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
010:008 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
        on Mount Gilboa.
010:009 They stripped him, and took his head, and his armor,
        and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
        to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.
010:010 They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened
        his head in the house of Dagon.
010:011 When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had
        done to Saul,
010:012 all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul,
        and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried
        their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
010:013 So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh,
        because of the word of Yahweh, which he didn't keep; and also
        because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit,
        to inquire [thereby],
010:014 and didn't inquire of Yahweh:  therefore he killed him,
        and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron,
        saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
011:002 In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led
        out and brought in Israel:  and Yahweh your God said to you,
        You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall
        be prince over my people Israel.
011:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
        and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh;
        and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word
        of Yahweh by Samuel.
011:004 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus);
        and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
011:005 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here.
        Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is
        the city of David.
011:006 David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be
        chief and captain.  Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first,
        and was made chief.
011:007 David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it
        the city of David.
011:008 He built the city round about, from Millo even round about;
        and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
011:009 David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.
011:010 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had,
        who shown themselves strong with him in his kingdom,
        together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word
        of Yahweh concerning Israel.
011:011 This is the number of the mighty men whom David had:
        Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty;
        he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them
        at one time.
011:012 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was
        one of the three mighty men.
011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
        gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full
        of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
011:014 They stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed
        the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.
011:015 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David,
        into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines
        were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
011:016 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
011:017 David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink
        of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
011:018 The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew
        water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
        and took it, and brought it to David:  but David would not
        drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,
011:019 and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this:
        shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their
        lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives
        they brought it.  Therefore he would not drink it.
        These things did the three mighty men.
011:020 Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three;
        for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them,
        and had a name among the three.
011:021 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made
        their captain:  however he didn't attain to the [first] three.
011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
        who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel
        of Moab:  he went down also and killed a lion in the midst
        of a pit in time of snow.
011:023 He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high;
        and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam;
        and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear
        out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
011:025 Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't
        attain to the [first] three:  and David set him over his guard.
011:026 Also the mighty men of the armies:  Asahel the brother
        of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children
        of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
011:034 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of
        Shagee the Hararite,
011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,
011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer
        of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites,
        and thirty with him,
011:043 Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of
        Hotham the Aroerite,
011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam,
        and Ithmah the Moabite,
011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
012:001 Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
        kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish;
        and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.
012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and
        the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow:
        they were of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.
012:003 The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah
        the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth,
        and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,
012:004 and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty,
        and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan,
        and Jozabad the Gederathite,
012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah,
        and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
012:006 Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
        the Korahites,
012:007 and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
012:008 Of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to
        the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor,
        men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear;
        whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift
        as the roes on the mountains;
012:009 Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
012:014 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army:
        he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest
        to one thousand.
012:015 These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month,
        when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put
        to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east,
        and toward the west.
012:016 There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
        stronghold to David.
012:017 David went out to meet them, and answered them, If you be come
        peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you;
        but if [you be come] to betray me to my adversaries, seeing there
        is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon,
        and rebuke it.
012:018 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty,
        [and he said], "We are yours, David, and on your side, you son
        of Jesse:  peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers;
        for your God helps you."  Then David received them, and made
        them captains of the band.
012:019 Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David,
        when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle:
        but they didn't help them; for the lords of the Philistines
        sent him away after consultation, saying, He will fall away
        to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
        and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
        and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.
012:021 They helped David against the band of rovers:  for they were
        all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.
012:022 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there
        was a great army, like the army of God.
012:023 These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war,
        who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him,
        according to the word of Yahweh.
012:024 The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six
        thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.
012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war,
        seven thousand and one hundred.
012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
012:027 Jehoiada was the leader of [the house of] Aaron; and with him
        were three thousand and seven hundred,
012:028 and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's
        house twenty-two captains.
012:029 Of the children of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand:
        for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance
        to the house of Saul.
012:030 Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred,
        mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses.
012:031 Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were
        mentioned by name, to come and make David king.
012:032 Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times,
        to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred;
        and all their brothers were at their commandment.
012:033 Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could
        set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war,
        fifty thousand, and who could order [the battle array,
        and were] not of double heart.
012:034 Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield
        and spear thirty-seven thousand.
012:035 Of the Danites who could set the battle in array,
        twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
012:036 Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could
        set the battle in array, forty thousand.
012:037 On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites,
        and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh,
        with all manner of instruments of war for the battle,
        one hundred twenty thousand.
012:038 All these being men of war, who could order the battle array,
        came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over
        all Israel:  and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart
        to make David king.
012:039 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking;
        for their brothers had made preparation for them.
012:040 Moreover those who were near to them, [even] as far as
        Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys,
        and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal,
        cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil,
        and oxen, and sheep in abundance:  for there was joy in Israel.
013:001 David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
        even with every leader.
013:002 David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good to you,
        and if it be of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere
        to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom
        the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs,
        that they may gather themselves to us;
013:003 and let us bring again the ark of our God to us:
        for we didn't seek it in the days of Saul.
013:004 All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing
        was right in the eyes of all the people.
013:005 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor [the
        brook] of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring
        the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
013:006 David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is],
        to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from
        there the ark of God Yahweh that sits [above] the cherubim,
        that is called by the Name.
013:007 They carried the ark of God on a new cart, [and brought it] out
        of the house of Abinadab:  and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
013:008 David and all Israel played before God with all their might,
        even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments,
        and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
013:009 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put
        forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
013:010 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him,
        because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there
        he died before God.
013:011 David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza;
        and he called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.
013:012 David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring
        the ark of God home to me?
013:013 So David didn't move the ark to him into the city of David,
        but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
013:014 The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house
        three months:  and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom,
        and all that he had.
014:001 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
        and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
014:002 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel;
        for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.
014:003 David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father
        of more sons and daughters.
014:004 These are the names of the children whom he had
        in Jerusalem:  Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
014:005 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
014:006 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
014:007 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
014:008 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
        over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David:
        and David heard of it, and went out against them.
014:009 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the
        valley of Rephaim.
014:010 David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against
        the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand?
        Yahweh said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.
014:011 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there;
        and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand,
        like the breach of waters.  Therefore they called the name
        of that place Baal Perazim.
014:012 They left their gods there; and David gave commandment,
        and they were burned with fire.
014:013 The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
014:014 David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall
        not go up after them:  turn away from them, and come on them
        over against the mulberry trees.
014:015 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
        of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle;
        for God is gone out before you to strike the army
        of the Philistines.
014:016 David did as God commanded him:  and they struck the army
        of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
014:017 The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought
        the fear of him on all nations.
015:001 [David] made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared
        a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites:
        for them has Yahweh chosen to carry the ark of God,
        and to minister to him forever.
015:003 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark
        of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it.
015:004 David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:
015:005 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers
        one hundred twenty;
015:006 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers
        two hundred twenty;
015:007 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers
        one hundred thirty;
015:008 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his
        brothers two hundred;
015:009 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;
015:010 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers
        one hundred twelve.
015:011 David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites,
        for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
015:012 and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of
        the Levites:  sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers,
        that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        to [the place] that I have prepared for it.
015:013 For because you didn't carry it at the first, Yahweh our God
        made a breach on us, because we didn't seek him according
        to the ordinance.
015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
        up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
015:015 The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their
        shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded according
        to the word of Yahweh.
015:016 David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers
        the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments
        and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up
        the voice with joy.
015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers,
        Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari
        their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
015:018 and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben,
        and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab,
        and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu,
        and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.
015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed]
        with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;
015:020 and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
        and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments
        set to Alamoth;
015:021 and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom,
        and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed
        lyre, to lead.
015:022 Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song:
        he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.
015:023 Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
015:024 Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai,
        and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests,
        did blow the trumpets before the ark of God:  and Obed-Edom
        and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
        went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of
        the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
015:026 It happened, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed seven bulls
        and seven rams.
015:027 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen,
        and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers,
        and Chenaniah the master of the song [with] the singers:
        and David had on him an ephod of linen.
015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet,
        and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed
        instruments and harps.
015:029 It happened, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to
        the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked
        out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing;
        and she despised him in her heart.
016:001 They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst
        of the tent that David had pitched for it:  and they offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
016:002 When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and
        the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.
016:003 He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman,
        to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh],
        and a cake of raisins.
016:004 He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark
        of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh,
        the God of Israel:
016:005 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth,
        and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom,
        and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps;
        and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
016:006 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually,
        before the ark of the covenant of God.
016:007 Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh,
        by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.
016:008 Oh give thanks to Yahweh.  Call on his name.  Make his doings
        known among the peoples.
016:009 Sing to him.  Sing praises to him.  Tell of all his marvelous works.
016:010 Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who
        seek Yahweh rejoice.
016:011 Seek you Yahweh and his strength.  Seek his face forever more.
016:012 Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth,
016:013 you seed of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob,
        his chosen ones.
016:014 He is Yahweh our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
016:015 Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded
        to a thousand generations,
016:016 [the covenant] which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.
016:017 He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, and to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,
016:018 saying, I will you give the land of Canaan, The lot
        of your inheritance,
016:019 when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few,
        and foreigners were in it.
016:020 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom
        to another people.
016:021 He allowed no man to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,
016:022 [saying], Don't touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm.
016:023 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!  Display his salvation from
        day to day.
016:024 Declare his glory among the nations, and his marvelous works
        among all the peoples.
016:025 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised.
        He also is to be feared above all gods.
016:026 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh
        made the heavens.
016:027 Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and gladness are
        in his place.
016:028 Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples, ascribe to
        Yahweh glory and strength!
016:029 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering,
        and come before him.  Worship Yahweh in holy array.
016:030 Tremble before him, all the earth.  The world also is established
        that it can't be moved.
016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice!
        Let them say among the nations, Yahweh reigns.
016:032 Let the sea roar, and its fullness!  Let the field exult,
        and all that is therein!
016:033 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh,
        for he comes to judge the earth.
016:034 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
016:035 Say, Save us, God of our salvation!  Gather us together and
        deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name,
        to triumph in your praise.
016:036 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even
        to everlasting.  All the people said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.
016:037 So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph
        and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually,
        as every day's work required;
016:038 and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also
        the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;
016:039 and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tent
        of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon,
016:040 to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering
        continually morning and evening, even according to all that is
        written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel;
016:041 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen,
        who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh,
        because his loving kindness endures forever;
016:042 and with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals
        for those that should sound aloud, and [with] instruments for
        the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
016:043 All the people departed every man to his house:
        and David returned to bless his house.
017:001 It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said
        to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar,
        but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh [dwells] under curtains.
017:002 Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God
        is with you.
017:003 It happened the same night, that the word of God came
        to Nathan, saying,
017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus says Yahweh, You shall
        not build me a house to dwell in:
017:005 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
        up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent,
        and from [one] tent [to another].
017:006 In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, spoke I
        a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded
        to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have you not built
        me a house of cedar?
017:007 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
        Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following
        the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel:
017:008 and I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off
        all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name,
        like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
017:009 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
        that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more;
        neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more,
        as at the first,
017:010 and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over
        my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies.
        Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.
017:011 It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go
        to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you,
        who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
017:012 He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son:  and I will not
        take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him
        that was before you;
017:014 but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever;
        and his throne shall be established forever.
017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
        so did Nathan speak to David.
017:016 Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
        and he said, Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house,
        that you have brought me thus far?
017:017 This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have
        spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come,
        and have regarded me according to the estate of a man
        of high degree, Yahweh God.
017:018 What can David [say] yet more to you concerning the honor
        which is done to your servant? for you know your servant.
017:019 Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart,
        have you worked all this greatness, to make known all
        [these] great things.
017:020 Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you,
        according to all that we have heard with our ears.
017:021 What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you
        a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations
        from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?
017:022 For your people Israel did you make your own people forever;
        and you, Yahweh, became their God.
017:023 Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning
        your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever,
        and do as you have spoken.
017:024 Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying,
        Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel:
        and the house of David your servant is established before you.
017:025 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will
        build him a house:  therefore has your servant found [in
        his heart] to pray before you.
017:026 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing
        to your servant:
017:027 and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant,
        that it may continue forever before you:  for you, Yahweh,
        have blessed, and it is blessed forever.
018:001 After this it happened, that David struck the Philistines,
        and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand
        of the Philistines.
018:002 He struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David,
        and brought tribute.
018:003 David struck Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went
        to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
018:004 David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven
        thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David
        hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them
        for one hundred chariots.
018:005 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
        of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.
018:006 Then David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus;
        and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
018:007 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
018:008 From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took
        very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea,
        and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
018:009 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army
        of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
018:010 he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him,
        because he had fought against Hadarezer and struck him;
        (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and [he had with him]
        all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
018:011 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
        and the gold that he carried away from all the nations;
        from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon,
        and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites
        in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
018:013 He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants
        to David.  Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
018:014 David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and
        righteousness to all his people.
018:015 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;
018:016 and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
        were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
018:017 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief
        about the king.
019:001 It happened after this, that Nahash the king of the children
        of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
019:002 David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son
        of Nahash, because his father shown kindness to me.
        So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon
        to Hanun, to comfort him.
019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you
        that David does honor your father, in that he has sent
        comforters to you?  Aren't his servants come to you to search,
        and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
019:004 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut
        off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks,
        and sent them away.
019:005 Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men
        were served.  He sent to meet them; for the men were
        greatly ashamed.  The king said, Stay at Jericho until your
        beards be grown, and then return.
019:006 When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
        odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one
        thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen
        out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
019:007 So they hired them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king
        of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba.
        The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
        their cities, and came to battle.
019:008 When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
        of the mighty men.
019:009 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
        at the gate of the city:  and the kings who had come were
        by themselves in the field.
019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians.
019:011 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
        his brother; and they put themselves in array against
        the children of Ammon.
019:012 He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
        help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you,
        then I will help you.
019:013 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
        and for the cities of our God:  and Yahweh do that which
        seems him good.
019:014 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before
        the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
019:015 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
        into the city.  Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
019:016 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
        they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond
        the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadarezer
        at their head.
019:017 It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle
        in array against them.  So when David had put the battle
        in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
019:018 The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
        [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen,
        and killed Shophach the captain of the army.
019:019 When the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse
        before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him:
        neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
020:001 It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time
        when kings go out [to battle], that Joab led forth the army,
        and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came
        and besieged Rabbah.  But David stayed at Jerusalem.
        Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.
020:002 David took the crown of their king from off his head,
        and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were
        precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head:
        and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
020:003 He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut [them]
        with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes.
        Thus did David to all the cities of the children of Ammon.
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
020:004 It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with
        the Philistines:  then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai,
        of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
020:005 There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
        of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
        the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
020:006 There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
        whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six [on each hand],
        and six [on each foot]; and he also was born to the giant.
020:007 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
        brother killed him.
020:008 These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
        of David, and by the hand of his servants.
021:001 Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
021:002 David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go,
        number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word,
        that I may know the sum of them.
021:003 Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many
        as they are:  but, my lord the king, aren't they all my
        lord's servants?  Why does my lord require this thing?
        Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?
021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab.
        Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel,
        and came to Jerusalem.
021:005 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David.
        All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand
        men who drew sword:  and in Judah were four hundred seventy
        thousand men who drew sword.
021:006 But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's
        word was abominable to Joab.
021:007 God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.
021:008 David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done
        this thing:  but now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity
        of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
021:009 Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
021:010 Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you
        three things:  choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
021:011 So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take
        which you will:
021:012 either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed
        before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you;
        or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence
        in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout
        all the borders of Israel.  Now therefore consider what answer
        I shall return to him who sent me.
021:013 David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let me fall, I pray,
        into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies:
        and let me not fall into the hand of man.
021:014 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel
        seventy thousand men.
021:015 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it:  and as he was
        about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he repented him of the evil,
        and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand.
        The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor
        of Ornan the Jebusite.
021:016 David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing
        between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand
        stretched out over Jerusalem.  Then David and the elders,
        clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
021:017 David said to God, Isn't it I who commanded the people
        to be numbered?  It is even I who have sinned and done
        very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done?
        Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me,
        and against my father's house; but not against your people,
        that they should be plagued.
021:018 Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David, that David
        should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing
        floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
021:019 David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the
        name of Yahweh.
021:020 Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were
        with him hid themselves.  Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
021:021 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
        out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David
        with his face to the ground.
021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this
        threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh:
        for the full price shall you give it me, that the plague
        may be stayed from the people.
021:023 Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king
        do that which is good in his eyes:  behold, I give [you] the oxen
        for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood,
        and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.
021:024 King David said to Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it
        for the full price:  for I will not take that which is yours
        for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.
021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels
        of gold by weight.
021:026 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered
        him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.
021:027 Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
        into the sheath of it.
021:028 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered
        him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
        then he sacrificed there.
021:029 For the tent of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness,
        and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high
        place at Gibeon.
021:030 But David couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for he was
        afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.
022:001 Then David said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this
        is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
022:002 David commanded to gather together the foreigners who were
        in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew worked stones
        to build the house of God.
022:003 David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
        of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in
        abundance without weight;
022:004 and cedar trees without number:  for the Sidonians and they
        of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.
022:005 David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
        that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent,
        of fame and of glory throughout all countries:
        I will therefore make preparation for it.  So David prepared
        abundantly before his death.
022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
        a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
022:007 David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart
        to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.
022:008 But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed
        blood abundantly, and have made great wars:  you shall not
        build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood
        on the earth in my sight.
022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest;
        and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about;
        for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
        quietness to Israel in his days:
022:010 he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son,
        and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne
        of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
022:011 Now, my son, Yahweh be with you; and prosper you, and build
        the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
022:012 May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put
        you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law
        of Yahweh your God.
022:013 Then shall you prosper, if you observe to do the statutes
        and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel.
        Be strong, and of good courage.  Don't be afraid,
        neither be dismayed.
022:014 Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house
        of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one thousand
        thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight;
        for it is in abundance:  timber also and stone have I prepared;
        and you may add to them.
022:015 There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers
        of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful
        in every kind of work:
022:016 of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
        no number.  Arise and be doing, and Yahweh be with you.
022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
        his son, [saying],
022:018 Isn't Yahweh your God with you?  Hasn't he given you rest on
        every side? for he has delivered the inhabitants of the land
        into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh,
        and before his people.
022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God;
        arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God,
        into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh.
023:001 Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son
        king over Israel.
023:002 He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests
        and the Levites.
023:003 The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward:
        and their number by their polls, man by man,
        was thirty-eight thousand.
023:004 Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of
        the house of Yahweh; and six thousand were officers and judges;
023:005 and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised
        Yahweh with the instruments which I made, [said David],
        for giving praise.
023:006 David divided them into divisions according to the sons
        of Levi:  Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
023:007 Of the Gershonites:  Ladan and Shimei.
023:008 The sons of Ladan:  Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
023:009 The sons of Shimei:  Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
        These were the heads of the fathers' [houses] of Ladan.
023:010 The sons of Shimei:  Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
        These four were the sons of Shimei.
023:011 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second:  but Jeush and Beriah
        didn't have many sons; therefore they became a fathers'
        house in one reckoning.
023:012 The sons of Kohath:  Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
023:013 The sons of Amram:  Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated,
        that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons,
        forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him,
        and to bless in his name, forever.
023:014 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among
        the tribe of Levi.
023:015 The sons of Moses:  Gershom and Eliezer.
023:016 The sons of Gershom:  Shebuel the chief.
023:017 The sons of Eliezer were:  Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer
        had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
023:018 The sons of Izhar:  Shelomith the chief.
023:019 The sons of Hebron:  Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
023:020 The sons of Uzziel:  Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
023:021 The sons of Merari:  Mahli and Mushi.  The sons of Mahli:
        Eleazar and Kish.
023:022 Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only:
        and their brothers the sons of Kish took them [to wife].
023:023 The sons of Mushi:  Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
023:024 These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses,
        even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were
        counted individually, in the number of names by their polls,
        who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh,
        from twenty years old and upward.
023:025 For David said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest
        to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever:
023:026 and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tent
        and all the vessels of it for the service of it.
023:027 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered,
        from twenty years old and upward.
023:028 For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service
        of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the chambers,
        and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work
        of the service of the house of God;
023:029 for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering,
        whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked
        in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner
        of measure and size;
023:030 and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh,
        and likewise in the evening;
023:031 and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths,
        on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according
        to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;
023:032 and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting,
        and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons
        of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Yahweh.
024:001 These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron.  The sons
        of Aaron:  Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children:
        therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
024:003 David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of
        the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering
        in their service.
024:004 There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
        than of the sons of Ithamar; and [thus] were they divided:
        of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers'
        houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to
        their fathers' houses, eight.
024:005 Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots;
        for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God,
        both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
024:006 Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites,
        wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes,
        and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
        and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the priests and
        of the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar,
        and one taken for Ithamar.
024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
024:008 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
024:009 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
024:010 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
024:011 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
024:012 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
024:013 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
024:014 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
024:015 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
024:016 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
024:017 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
024:018 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
024:019 This was the ordering of them in their service, to come
        into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance [given]
        to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        had commanded him.
024:020 Of the rest of the sons of Levi:  of the sons of Amram, Shubael;
        of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
024:021 Of Rehabiah:  of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
024:022 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
024:023 The sons [of Hebron]: Jeriah [the chief], Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
024:024 The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
024:025 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
024:026 The sons of Merari:  Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah:  Beno.
024:027 The sons of Merari:  of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham,
        and Zaccur, and Ibri.
024:028 Of Mahli:  Eleazar, who had no sons.
024:029 Of Kish; the sons of Kish:  Jerahmeel.
024:030 The sons of Mushi:  Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.
        These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses.
024:031 These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron
        in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech,
        and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the priests
        and of the Levites; the fathers' [houses] of the chief even
        as those of his younger brother.
025:001 Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service
        certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
        who should prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments,
        and with cymbals:  and the number of those who did the work
        according to their service was:
025:002 of the sons of Asaph:  Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah,
        and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph,
        who prophesied after the order of the king.
025:003 Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun:  Gedaliah, and Zeri,
        and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands
        of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied
        in giving thanks and praising Yahweh.
025:004 Of Heman; the sons of Heman:  Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel,
        and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
        and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.
025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
        of God, to lift up the horn.  God gave to Heman fourteen sons
        and three daughters.
025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house
        of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps,
        for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman
        being under the order of the king.
025:007 The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed
        in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful,
        was two hundred eighty-eight.
025:008 They cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small
        as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph:
        the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and sons were twelve:
025:010 the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:011 the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:012 the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:013 the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:014 the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

025:021 for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:022 for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:023 for the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:024 for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and
        his brothers, twelve:
025:025 for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:026 for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:027 for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:
025:028 for the one and twentieth to Hothir, his sons and
        his brothers, twelve:
025:029 for the two and twentieth to Giddalti, his sons and
        his brothers, twelve:
025:030 for the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, his sons and
        his brothers, twelve:
025:031 for the four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, his sons and
        his brothers, twelve.
026:001 For the divisions of the doorkeepers:  of the Korahites, Meshelemiah
        the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
026:002 Meshelemiah had sons:  Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second,
        Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
026:004 Obed-Edom had sons:  Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second,
        Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth,
026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth;
        for God blessed him.
026:006 Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born, who ruled over the house
        of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.
026:007 The sons of Shemaiah:  Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
        whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
026:008 All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom: they and their sons
        and their brothers, able men in strength for the service;
        sixty-two of Obed-Edom.
026:009 Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, valiant men, eighteen.
026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons:
        Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn,
        yet his father made him chief),
026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
        all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.
026:012 Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the
        chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister
        in the house of Yahweh.
026:013 They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to
        their fathers' houses, for every gate.
026:014 The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.  Then for Zechariah his son,
        a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.
026:015 To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse.
026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth,
        at the causeway that goes up, watch against watch.
026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four
        a day, and for the storehouse two and two.
026:018 For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.
026:019 These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons
        of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.
026:020 Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God,
        and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
026:021 The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan,
        the heads of the fathers' [houses] belonging to Ladan
        the Gershonite:  Jehieli.
026:022 The sons of Jehieli:  Zetham, and Joel his brother,
        over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.
026:023 Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites,
        of the Uzzielites:
026:024 and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler
        over the treasures.
026:025 His brothers:  of Eliezer [came] Rehabiah his son,
        and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son,
        and Shelomoth his son.
026:026 This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures
        of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads
        of the fathers' [houses], the captains over thousands and hundreds,
        and the captains of the army, had dedicated.
026:027 Out of the spoil won in battles did they dedicate to repair
        the house of Yahweh.
026:028 All that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner
        the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated,
        whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth,
        and of his brothers.
026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
        business over Israel, for officers and judges.
026:030 Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor,
        one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel
        beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh,
        and for the service of the king.
026:031 Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites,
        according to their generations by fathers' [houses]. In
        the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
        and there were found among them mighty men of valor at
        Jazer of Gilead.
026:032 His brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred,
        heads of fathers' [houses], whom king David made overseers
        over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe
        of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God,
        and for the affairs of the king.
027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers'
        [houses] and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
        and their officers who served the king, in any matter
        of the divisions which came in and went out month by month
        throughout all the months of the year--of every division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:002 Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son
        of Zabdiel:  and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:003 [He was] of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains
        of the army for the first month.
027:004 Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite,
        and his division; and Mikloth the ruler:  and in his division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:005 The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah,
        the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief:  and in his division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:006 This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty man of the thirty,
        and over the thirty:  and [of] his division was Ammizabad his son.
027:007 The fourth [captain] for the fourth month was Asahel
        the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him:
        and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:008 The fifth captain for this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite:
        and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:009 The sixth [captain] for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh
        the Tekoite:  and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:010 The seventh [captain] for the seventh month was Helez
        the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim:  and in his division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:011 The eighth [captain] for the eighth month was Sibbecai
        the Hushathite, of the Zerahites:  and in his division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:012 The ninth [captain] for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite,
        of the Benjamites:  and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:013 The tenth [captain] for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite,
        of the Zerahites:  and in his division were Twenty-four thousand.
027:014 The eleventh [captain] for the eleventh month was
        Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim:
        and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
027:015 The twelfth [captain] for the twelfth month was Heldai
        the Netophathite, of Othniel:  and in his division
        were twenty-four thousand.
027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel:
        of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler:
        of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah:
027:017 of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel:  of Aaron, Zadok:
027:018 of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David:
        of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:
027:019 of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah:  of Naphtali, Jeremoth
        the son of Azriel:
027:020 of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah:
        of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:
027:021 of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah:
        of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:
027:022 of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham.  These were the captains
        of the tribes of Israel.
027:023 But David didn't take the number of them from twenty years old
        and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel
        like the stars of the sky.
027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but didn't finish;
        and there came wrath for this on Israel; neither was the number
        put into the account in the chronicles of king David.
027:025 Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
        and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities,
        and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan
        the son of Uzziah:
027:026 Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground
        was Ezri the son of Chelub:
027:027 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite:
        and over the increase of the vineyards for the winecellars
        was Zabdi the Shiphmite:
027:028 and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in
        the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite:  and over the cellars
        of oil was Joash:
027:029 and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite:
        and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat
        the son of Adlai:
027:030 and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite:
        and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
        and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.
027:031 All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.
027:032 Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a man
        of understanding, and a scribe:  and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni
        was with the king's sons:
027:033 Ahithophel was the king's counselor:  and Hushai the Archite
        was the king's friend:
027:034 and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar:
        and the captain of the king's army was Joab.
028:001 David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes,
        and the captains of the companies who served the king by division,
        and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds,
        and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king
        and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men,
        even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.
028:002 Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, Hear me,
        my brothers, and my people:  as for me, it was in my heart
        to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready
        for the building.
028:003 But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name,
        because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.
028:004 However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all
        the house of my father to be king over Israel forever:
        for he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah,
        the house of my father; and among the sons of my father
        he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;
028:005 Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has
        chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom
        of Yahweh over Israel.
028:006 He said to me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house
        and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
        will be his father.
028:007 I will establish his kingdom forever, if he be constant to do
        my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.
028:008 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh,
        and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all
        the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this
        good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
        after you forever.
028:009 You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve
        him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh
        searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations
        of the thoughts:  if you seek him, he will be found of you;
        but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.
028:010 Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house
        for the sanctuary:  be strong, and do it.
028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of
        the temple], and of the houses of it, and of the treasuries of it,
        and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner chambers of it,
        and of the place of the mercy seat;
028:012 and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts
        of the house of Yahweh, and for all the surrounding rooms,
        for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries
        of the dedicated things;
028:013 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites,
        and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh,
        and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;
028:014 of gold by weight for the [vessels of] gold, for all vessels
        of every kind of service; [of silver] for all the vessels
        of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;
028:015 by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for the lamps of it,
        of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for the lamps of it;
        and for the lampstands of silver, [silver] by weight for [every]
        lampstand and for the lamps of it, according to the use
        of every lampstand;
028:016 and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table;
        and silver for the tables of silver;
028:017 and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold;
        and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl;
        and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
028:018 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight;
        and gold for the pattern of the chariot, [even] the cherubim,
        that spread out [their wings], and covered the ark of the
        covenant of Yahweh.
028:019 All this, [said David], have I been made to understand in writing
        from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.
028:020 David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage,
        and do it:  don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God,
        even my God, is with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you,
        until all the work for the service of the house of
        Yahweh is finished.
028:021 Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and
        the Levites, for all the service of the house of God:
        and there shall be with you in all manner of work every
        willing man who has skill, for any manner of service:
        also the captains and all the people will be entirely
        at your command.
029:001 David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son,
        whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender,
        and the work is great; for the palace is not for man,
        but for Yahweh God.
029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
        the gold for the [things of] gold, and the silver for the [things
        of] silver, and the brass for the [things of] brass, the iron
        for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood;
        onyx stones, and [stones] to be set, stones for inlaid work,
        and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones,
        and marble stones in abundance.
029:003 In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God,
        seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver,
        I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I
        have prepared for the holy house,
029:004 even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir,
        and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to
        overlay the walls of the houses;
029:005 of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things
        of] silver, and for all manner of work [to be made] by the hands
        of artificers.  Who then offers willingly to consecrate
        himself this day to Yahweh?
029:006 Then the princes of the fathers' [houses], and the princes of the
        tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
        with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;
029:007 and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
        thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten
        thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
        and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
029:008 They with whom [precious] stones were found gave them
        to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand
        of Jehiel the Gershonite.
029:009 Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly,
        because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh:
        and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
029:010 Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly;
        and David said, You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel
        our father, forever and ever.
029:011 Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory,
        the victory, and the majesty:  for all that is in the heavens
        and in the earth is yours.  Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you
        are exalted as head above all.
029:012 Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all;
        and in your hand is power and might; and it is in your hand
        to make great, and to give strength to all.
029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able
        to offer so willingly as this?  For all things come of you,
        and of your own have we given you.
029:015 For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all
        our fathers were:  our days on the earth are as a shadow,
        and there is no abiding.
029:016 Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to
        build you a house for your holy name comes of your hand,
        and is all your own.
029:017 I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have
        pleasure in uprightness.  As for me, in the uprightness
        of my heart I have willingly offered all these things:
        and now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here,
        offer willingly to you.
029:018 Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
        keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
        of your people, and prepare their heart to you;
029:019 and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments,
        your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things,
        and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
029:020 David said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh your God.
        All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
        and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before
        Yahweh and the king.
029:021 They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt
        offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one
        thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs,
        with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
        for all Israel,
029:022 and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness.
        They made Solomon the son of David king the second time,
        and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David
        his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
029:024 All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons
        of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
029:025 Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel,
        and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on
        any king before him in Israel.
029:026 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
029:027 The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
        he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three [years]
        reigned he in Jerusalem.
029:028 He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor:
        and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
        written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history
        of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
029:030 with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him,
        and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the

may have other legal rights.
