phenomena generally, with the result that every wild imagination of
every crank or half-crazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest
in the fertilising soil of his disordered brain. Thus negatively and
positively all things began to work to a common end. Not the least of
his disturbing causes was Saft Tammie, who had now become at certain
times of the day a fixture at his gate. After a while, being
interested in the previous state of this individual, he made inquiries
regarding his past with the following result.

Saft Tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of
the counties round the Firth of Forth. He had been partially educated
for the ministry, but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up
his prospects suddenly, and, going to Peterhead in its days of whaling
prosperity, had there taken service on a whaler. Here off and on he
had remained for some years, getting gradually more and more silent in
his habits, till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a
mate, and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the
northern fleet. He had worked for many years at the fishing with
always the reputation of being 'a wee bit daft,' till at length he had
gradually settled down at Crooken, where the laird, doubtless knowing
something of his family history, had given him a job which practically
made him a pensioner. The minister who gave the information finished
thus:--

'It is a very strange thing, but the man seems to have some odd kind
of gift. Whether it be that "second sight" which we Scotch people are
so prone to believe in, or some other occult form of knowledge, I know
not, but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place
but the men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some
saying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it. He gets
uneasy or excited--wakes up, in fact--when death is in the air!'

This did not in any way tend to lessen Mr. Markam's concern, but on
the contrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind.
Of all the books which he had read on his new subject of study none
interested him so much as a German one _Die Döppleganger_, by Dr.
Heinrich von Aschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the
first time of cases where men had led a double existence--each nature
being quite apart from the other--the body being always a reality with
one spirit, and a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr.
Markam realised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The
glimpse which he had of his own back the night of his escape from the
quicksand--his own footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no
return steps visible--the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting
himself and perishing in the quicksand--all lent aid to the conviction
that he was in his own person an instance of the döppleganger. Being
then conscious of a double life he took steps to prove its existence
to his own satisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed
he wrote his name in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he
dreamed of the quicksand, and of his visiting it--dreamed so vividly
that on walking in the grey of the dawn he could not believe that he
had not been there. Arising, without disturbing his wife, he sought
his shoes.

The chalk signatures were undisturbed! He dressed himself and stole
out softly. This time the tide was in, so he crossed the dunes and
struck the shore on the further side of the quicksand. There, oh,
horror of horrors! he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss!

He went home a desperately sad man. It seemed incredible that he, an
elderly commercial man, who had passed a long and uneventful life in
the pursuit of business in the midst of roaring, practical London,
should thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror, and that he
should discover that he had two existences. He could not speak of his
trouble even to his own wife, for well he knew that she would at once
require the fullest particulars of that other life--the one which she
did not know; and that she would at the start not only imagine but
charge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it. And so
his brooding grew deeper and deeper still. One evening--the tide then
going out and the moon being at the full--he was sitting waiting for
dinner when the maid announced that Saft Tammie was making a
disturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him. He was
very indignant, but did not like the maid to think that he had any
fear on the subject, and so told her to bring him in. Tammie entered,
walking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous
decision in the eyes that were so generally cast down. As soon as he
entered he said:

'I have come to see ye once again--once again; and there ye sit, still
just like a cockatoo on a pairch. Weel, mon, I forgie ye! Mind ye
that, I forgie ye!' And without a word more he turned and walked out
of the house, leaving the master in speechless indignation.

After dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksand--he
would not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go. And so,
about nine o'clock, in full array, he marched to the beach, and
passing over the sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock. The full
moon was behind him and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of
foam, the dark outline of the headland, and the stakes of the
salmon-nets were all emphasised. In the brilliant yellow glow the
lights in the windows of Port Crooken and in those of the distant
castle of the laird trembled like stars through the sky. For a long
time he sat and drank in the beauty of the scene, and his soul seemed
to feel a peace that it had not known for many days. All the pettiness
and annoyance and silly fears of the past weeks seemed blotted out,
and a new holy calm took the vacant place. In this sweet and solemn
mood he reviewed his late action calmly, and felt ashamed of himself
for his vanity and for the obstinacy which had followed it. And then
and there he made up his mind that the present would be the last time
he would wear the costume which had estranged him from those whom he
loved, and which had caused him so many hours and days of chagrin,
vexation, and pain.

But almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice
seemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever
get the chance to wear the suit again--that it was too late--he had
chosen his course and must now abide the issue.

'It is not too late,' came the quick answer of his better self; and
full of the thought, he rose up to go home and divest himself of the
now hateful costume right away. He paused for one look at the
beautiful scene. The light lay pale and mellow, softening every
outline of rock and tree and house-top, and deepening the shadows into
velvety-black, and lighting, as with a pale flame, the incoming tide,
that now crept fringe-like across the flat waste of sand. Then he left
the rock and stepped out for the shore.

But as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him, and for an
instant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the
full moon. Once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond
the quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore. The shock was all
the greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just
enjoyed; and, almost paralysed in every sense, he stood and watched
the fatal vision and the wrinkly, crawling quicksand that seemed to
writhe and yearn for something that lay between. There could be no
mistake this time, for though the moon behind threw the face into
shadow he could see there the same shaven cheeks as his own, and the
small stubby moustache of a few weeks' growth. The light shone on the
brilliant tartan, and on the eagle's plume. Even the bald space at one
side of the Glengarry cap glistened, as did the cairngorm brooch on
the shoulder and the tops of the silver buttons. As he looked he felt
his feet slightly sinking, for he was still near the edge of the belt
of quicksand, and he stepped back. As he did so the other figure
stepped forward, so that the space between them was preserved.

So the two stood facing each other, as though in some weird
fascination; and in the rushing of the blood through his brain Markam
seemed to hear the words of the prophecy: 'See thyself face to face,
and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee.' He did stand face to face
with himself, he had repented--and now he was sinking in the
quicksand! The warning and prophecy were coming true.

Above him the seagulls screamed, circling round the fringe of the
incoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to
himself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet
only his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other
figure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the
quicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at
himself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his
soul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a
terrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands
the figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink
deeper into the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew
not, he advanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his
more forward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the
seagulls which seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty
effort he drew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it,
leaving his shoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran
from the place, never stopping till his breath and strength failed
him, and he sank half swooning on the grassy path through the
sandhills.

       *       *       *       *       *

Arthur Markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible
adventure--until at least such time as he should be complete master of
himself. Now that the fatal double--his other self--had been engulfed
in the quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind.

That night he slept soundly and did not dream at all; and in the
morning was quite his old self. It really seemed as though his newer
and worser self had disappeared for ever; and strangely enough Saft
Tammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there
again, but sat in his old place watching nothing, as of old, with
lack-lustre eye. In accordance with his resolution he did not wear his
Highland suit again, but one evening tied it up in a bundle, claymore,
dirk and philibeg and all, and bringing it secretly with him threw it
into the quicksand. With a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it
sucked below the sand, which closed above it into marble smoothness.
Then he went home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for
evening prayers:

'Well! my dears, you will be glad to hear that I have abandoned my
idea of wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I
was and how ridiculous I made myself! You shall never see it again!'

'Where is it, father?' asked one of the girls, wishing to say
something so that such a self-sacrificing announcement as her father's
should not be passed in absolute silence. His answer was so sweetly
given that the girl rose from her seat and came and kissed him. It
was:

'In the quicksand, my dear! and I hope that my worser self is buried
there along with it--for ever.'

       *       *       *       *       *

The remainder of the summer was passed at Crooken with delight by all
the family, and on his return to town Mr. Markam had almost forgotten
the whole of the incident of the quicksand, and all touching on it,
when one day he got a letter from the MacCallum More which caused him
much thought, though he said nothing of it to his family, and left it,
for certain reasons, unanswered. It ran as follows:--

      'The MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu.
        'The Scotch All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart.
          Copthall Court, E.C.,
            30th September, 1892.

'Dear Sir,--I trust you will pardon the liberty which I take in
writing to you, but I am desirous of making an inquiry, and I am
informed that you have been sojourning during the summer in
Aberdeenshire (Scotland, N.B.). My partner, Mr. Roderick MacDhu--as he
appears for business reasons on our bill-heads and in our
advertisements, his real name being Emmanuel Moses Marks of
London--went early last month to Scotland (N.B.) for a tour, but as I
have only once heard from him, shortly after his departure, I am
anxious lest any misfortune may have befallen him. As I have been
unable to obtain any news of him on making all inquiries in my power,
I venture to appeal to you. His letter was written in deep dejection
of spirit, and mentioned that he feared a judgment had come upon him
for wishing to appear as a Scotchman on Scottish soil, as he had one
moonlight night shortly after his arrival seen his 'wraith'. He
evidently alluded to the fact that before his departure he had
procured for himself a Highland costume similar to that which we had
the honour to supply to you, with which, as perhaps you will remember,
he was much struck. He may, however, never have worn it, as he was, to
my own knowledge, diffident about putting it on, and even went so far
as to tell me that he would at first only venture to wear it late at
night or very early in the morning, and then only in remote places,
until such time as he should get accustomed to it. Unfortunately he
did not advise me of his route so that I am in complete ignorance of
his whereabouts; and I venture to ask if you may have seen or heard of
a Highland costume similar to your own having been seen anywhere in
the neighbourhood in which I am told you have recently purchased the
estate which you temporarily occupied. I shall not expect an answer to
this letter unless you can give me some information regarding my
friend and partner, so pray do not trouble to reply unless there be
cause. I am encouraged to think that he may have been in your
neighbourhood as, though his letter is not dated, the envelope is
marked with the postmark of "Yellon" which I find is in Aberdeenshire,
and not far from the Mains of Crooken.

  'I have the honour to be, dear sir,
      'Yours very respectfully,
          'JOSHUA SHEENY COHEN BENJAMIN
            '(The MacCallum More.)'

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Transcriber's Notes

Certain typographical features of the original cannot be reproduced
Illustrations cannot be reproduced in this version of the text. They
are indicated in the text, in their approximate positions, as:
[Illustration: <caption>]. Autograph letters, signatures, and similar
documents which were presented as images in the original, but have been
transcribed here, in lieu of captions.

Italic fonts are rendered using delimiting underscores, as _italic_.
The 'oe' ligature is spelled with separate characters. Words in all
small capital letters, including those which employ mixed case, are
shifted to uppercase.

Footnotes, which appeared at the bottom of the page, are positioned
at logical breaks following their references. They have been assigned
unique letters, beginning with 'A', and appear as:

 [A] Text of footnote.

The lists of Illustrations and Contents have several anomalous, though
accurate, entries. For example, the section on the re-incorporation of
the Red Cross, beginning on page 94, appears in the Contents between
sections on p. 184 and p. 197, for no apparent reason. The reference has
been placed in its proper position in the Contents. Please note that
the entries in the Contents do not always refer to formal sections of
the text. They sometimes direct one to a change of topic otherwise
unmarked in the text itself.

Several of the photographs associated with the Spanish American War,
which were included at the end of the volume on pp. 675 and 676, are
listed in the Illustrations where their subjects would appear.

The opening of the section on General History is labeled "Chapter I",
the only use of that designation in the volume.

                From the President of the United States

              In his Message to Congress December 6, 1898.


It is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordial appreciation
the timely and useful work of the American National Red Cross, both
in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in sanitary assistance
at several of the camps of assemblage, and, later, under the able and
experienced leadership of the president of the society, Miss Clara
Barton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in Cuba.
Working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under
their sanction and approval, and with the enthusiastic co-operation of
many patriotic women and societies in the various States, the Red
Cross has fully maintained its already high reputation for intense
earnestness and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its international
organization, thus justifying the confidence and support which
it has received at the hands of the American people. To the members
and officers and all who aided them in their philanthropic work,
the sincere and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public is due
and freely accorded.

In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations
to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe
guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and
offers humble prayers for the continuance of His favors.

TO THE PEOPLE.


In recounting the experience of the Red Cross in the Cuban campaign, I
have endeavored to tell the story of the events as they succeeded each
other, recording simply the facts connected with the work of the War
Relief, and refraining from criticism of men and methods. There were
unpleasant incidents to relate, and unfortunate conditions to describe,
but I have neither said nor written that any particular person, or
persons, were to blame. It is not my duty, nor is it within my power, to
analyze and criticise all the intricate workings of a government and its
armies in the field.

The conditions that existed during the campaign and the suffering that
had to be endured, were by no means peculiar to the Spanish-American
War. Suffering, sickness, confusion, and death--these are inseparable
from every armed conflict. They have always existed under such
circumstances; they are a part of war itself, against which no human
foresight can wholly provide.

Every civilized government is financially able to provide for its
armies, but the great and seemingly insuperable difficulty is, to always
have what is wanted at the place where it is most needed. It is a part
of the strategy of war, that an enemy seeks battle at a time and place
when his opponent is least prepared for it. Occasionally, too, an
attacking commander is deceived. Where he expects only slight
resistance, he encounters an overwhelming force and a battle of
unforeseen proportions, with unexpected casualties, occurs. This is the
universal testimony of nations. If it were not so, all needs could be
provided for and every move planned at the outset.

It was for these reasons that a body of gentlemen, now known as the
International Committee of Geneva, aided by National Associations in
each country, planned, urged and finally succeeded in securing the
adoption of the Treaty of the Red Cross. For these reasons the Treaty of
Geneva and the National Committees of the Red Cross exist to-day. It is
through the National Committees of the Red Cross in each treaty nation,
that the people seek to assist the government in times of great
emergency, in war or other calamity. It is only by favoring the
organization of this Auxiliary Relief in times of peace, encouraging its
development to the highest state of efficiency, preparing to utilize not
only all the ordinary resources, but also the generous support of the
people, through the Red Cross, that a government may hope to avoid much
of the needless suffering, sickness and death in war.

In carrying out its mission, to assist in the prevention and relief of
suffering, the Red Cross has neither the desire nor the intention to be
censorious, and is actuated neither by political opinion nor motives of
interference. It is but the outward and practical expression of that
universal sympathy that goes out from the millions of homes and
firesides, from the great heart of the nation, to humanity in distress,
to the soldier on the march, in the bivouac and on the field of battle.

Through all the past years, during which the Red Cross has sought
recognition, protection and co-operation, it was but for one purpose--to
be ready. Our only regret is that, during the late war, we were not
able to render greater service. Even the little that was accomplished,
could not have been done without the ever ready assistance of the
President and the Secretary of War.

Before us now lie the problems of the future, and the question is:
How shall we meet them? As friends of humanity, while there is still
a possibility of war or calamity, it behooves us to prepare. In America
perhaps, we are apt to undervalue careful preparation and depend too
much upon our impulses. Certainly in no other country have the
people so often risen from a state of unreadiness and accomplished such
wonderful results--at such a great sacrifice. The first American war
since the adoption of the Treaty of Geneva, has brought the Red Cross
home to the people; they have come to understand its meaning and
desire to become a permanent part of it. Now that the appropriate
time has come, it is the purpose of the Red Cross, relying upon the
active sympathy of the government and the generous support of the
people, to continue its work of preparation, until in its councils and in
its ranks the whole country shall be represented, standing together,
ready for any great emergency, inspired by the love of humanity and
the world-wide motto of the Red Cross:

    "In time of peace and prosperity, prepare for war and calamity."

INTRODUCTION.


To be called to tell in a few brief weeks the whole story of the Red
Cross from its origin to the present time seems a labor scarcely less
than to have lived it. It is a task that, however unworthily it may now
be performed, is, in itself, not unworthy the genius of George Eliot or
Macaulay. It is a story illustrating the rapid rise of the humane
sentiment in the latter half of the nineteenth century. On its European
side, it tells of the first timid and cautious putting forth of the
sentiment of humanity in war, amid the rattling swords and guns of
Solferino, its deaths and wounds and its subsequent awful silence.

It tells of its later fertilization on the red fields of Gravelotte and
Sedan beneath my own personal observation.

It was from such surroundings as these that the Red Cross has become the
means by which philanthropy has been grafted onto the wild and savage
stem of war.

From the first filaments spun in the heart of a solitary traveler have
been drawn onward stronger and larger strands, until now more than forty
of the principal nations of the earth are bound together by bonds of the
highest international law, that must make war in the future less
barbarous than it has been in the past.

It gives hope that "the very torrent, tempest and whirlwind" of war
itself may some day at last, far off, perhaps, give way to the sunny and
pleasant days of perpetual and universal peace. When a proposition for
an absolute and common disarmament of nations, made by the strongest of
the rulers of Europe, will not be met by cynical sneers and suggestions
of Machiavelian craft.

On its American side it is a story of such immense success on the part
of the American National Red Cross in some of its greatest and most
difficult fields of labor, that no financial report of them has ever
been made, because the story would have been altogether incredible. The
universal opinion of ordinary business people would have been that these
results could not have been obtained on the means stated, and therefore
something must be wrong or hidden, and to save ourselves from painful
suspicion, it was decided, rightly or wrongly, that the story must
remain substantially untold till its work in other fields had prepared
the public mind to accept the literal truth.

But the time has come at last when the facts may properly be set forth
without fear that they will be discredited or undervalued.

It will relate some of the experiences, the labors, the successes and
triumphs of the American National Red Cross in times of peace, by which
it had prepared itself to enter upon the Cuban contest as its first
independent work in time of war.

The Red Cross has done its part in that contest in the same spirit in
which it has heretofore done all the work which has been committed to
its care. It has done it unobtrusively, faithfully and successfully.

It may not altogether have escaped censure in the rather wild cyclone of
criticism that has swept over the country, but we remember not so much
the faultfinding that may have occasionally been poured out upon the Red
Cross, as the blessings and benedictions from all sides for work well
and nobly done that have fallen even upon its humblest ministers and
assistants.

It has been truthfully said that "so great has been the pressure to
share the difficulties and dangers of this service with only
transportation and subsistence for pay, that the Red Cross could on
these terms have had as many volunteers as there were enlisted men, if
their services could have been utilized and made important."

Indeed, it seems to have become the milder romance of war, and is
gradually winning its way into the very heart of the pomp and
circumstance of "glorious" war itself.

The Red Cross has therefore come to be so loved and trusted, its
principles and insignia have been so deeply set into the substance of
international law and the life of many great nations, that people
everywhere are beginning to ask with enthusiasm about its origin and
history; about the principles on which it acts. They ask for some
statement of its experiences, its hardships and its perils, and for some
account of those who have been most prominent in its operations.

It is partially to answer these and many similar inquiries that this
book has been prepared. It is in part a compilation and revision of
various statements necessarily incomplete and unsatisfactory, made from
time to time to meet emergencies. In part it has been wholly rewritten.

A great portion of the story of the Red Cross has been told in other
languages than English, because it was of work done by other than
English people. Much of this literature has never been translated or
placed within the reach of the English-speaking public.

Although the gradual growth of the idea of something like humanity in
war, stimulated by the ignorant and insane horrors of India and the
Crimea, and soothed and instructed by the sensible and practical work of
Florence Nightingale, had slowly but surely led up to the conditions
which made such a movement possible, it was not until the remarkable
campaign of Napoleon III. in Northern Italy again woke the slumbering
sympathies of the world that any definite steps revealed themselves.

In compiling this book I have been compelled to make use of much of the
material contained in a previous history written by myself in 1883,
which in turn was based upon the records and the literature of the
International Committee, and the official correspondence connected with
the treaty.

THE RED CROSS.

CHAPTER I


On June 24, 1859, occurred the memorable battle of Solferino, in which
the French and Sardinians were arrayed against the Austrians. The battle
raged over a wide reach of country and continued for sixteen hours; at
the end of which sixteen thousand French and Sardinian soldiers and
twenty thousand Austrians lay dead or were wounded and disabled on that
field. The old and ever-recurring fact reappeared: the medical staff was
wholly inadequate to the immense task suddenly cast upon them. For days
after the battle the dead in part remained unburied, and the wounded
where they fell, or crawled away as they could for shelter and help.

A Swiss gentleman, Henri Dunant by name, was then traveling near that
battlefield, and was deeply impressed by the scenes there presented to
him. He joined in the work of relief, but the inadequacy of preparation
and the consequent suffering of the wounded haunted him afterwards and
impelled him to write a book entitled "A Souvenir of Solferino," in
which he strongly advocated more humane and extensive appliances of aid
to wounded soldiers. He lectured about them before the "Society of
Public Utility" of Geneva. M. Gustav Moynier, a gentleman of independent
fortune, was then president of that society. Dr. Louis Appia, a
philanthropic physician, and Adolph Ador, a counsellor of repute in
Geneva, became interested in his views. They drew the attention of
Dufour, the general of the Swiss army, to the subject, and enlisted his
hearty co-operation. A meeting of this society was called to consider "a
proposition relative to the formation of permanent societies for the
relief of wounded soldiers." This meeting took place on the ninth of
February, 1863. The matter was laid fully before the society. It was
heartily received and acted upon and a committee was appointed with M.
Moynier at its head to examine into methods by which the desired
results might be obtained. So fully did this committee realize its
responsibility and the magnitude, grandeur and labor of the undertaking,
that the first steps were made even with timidity. But overcoming all
obstacles, it decided upon a plan which seemed possible, and announced
for the twenty-sixth of the following October a reunion to which were
invited from many countries men sympathizing with its views or able to
assist in its discussions. This international conference was held at the
appointed time, and continued its sessions four days. At this meeting it
was decided to call an international convention to be held at Geneva
during the autumn of the following year (1864). At this convention was
brought out the Geneva Treaty, and a permanent international committee
with headquarters at Geneva was formed, and the fundamental plan of the
national permanent relief societies adopted.

One of the first objects necessary and desired by the International
Committee for the successful prosecution of its work was the
co-operation by some of the more important states of Europe in a treaty
which should recognize the neutrality of the hospitals established, of
the sick and wounded, and of all persons and effects connected with the
relief service; also the adoption of a uniform protective sign or badge.
It inquired with care into the disposition of the several governments,
and was met with active sympathy and moral support. It first secured the
co-operation of the Swiss Federal Council and the Emperor of France. It
shortly after procured the signatures of ten other governments, which
were given at its room in the city hall of Geneva, August 22, 1864, and
was called the Convention of Geneva.

Its sign or badge was also agreed upon, namely, a red cross on a white
ground, which was to be worn on the arm by all persons acting with or in
the service of the committees enrolled under the convention.

The treaty provides for the neutrality of all sanitary supplies,
ambulances, surgeons, nurses, attendants, and sick or wounded men, and
their safe conduct when they bear the sign of the organization, viz: the
Red Cross.

Although the convention which originated the organization was
necessarily international, the relief societies themselves are entirely
national and independent; each one governing itself and making its own
laws, according to the genius of its nationality and needs.

It was necessary for recognition and safety, and for carrying out the
general provisions of the treaty, that a uniform badge should be agreed
upon. The Red Cross was chosen out of compliment to the Swiss republic,
where the first convention was held, and in which the central committee
has its headquarters. The Swiss colors being a white cross on a red
ground, the badge chosen was these colors reversed.

There are no "members of the Red Cross," but only members of societies
whose _sign_ it is. There is no "_Order of the Red Cross_." The relief
societies use, each according to its convenience, whatever methods seem
best suited to prepare in times of peace for the necessities of sanitary
service in times of war. They gather and store gifts of money and
supplies; arrange hospitals, ambulances, methods of transportation of
wounded men, bureaus of information, correspondence, etc. All that the
most ingenious philanthropy could devise and execute has been attempted
in this direction.

In the Franco-Prussian war this was abundantly tested. That Prussia
acknowledged its beneficence is proven by the fact that the emperor
affixed the Red Cross to the Iron Cross of Merit. The number of
governments adhering to the treaty was shortly after increased to
twenty-two and at the present date there are forty-two.

The German-Austria war of 1866, though not fully developing the
advantages of this international law, was yet the means of discovering
its imperfections. Consequently, in 1867 the relief societies of Paris
considered it necessary that the treaty should be revised, modified and
completed. Requests were issued for modification. The International
Committee transmitted them to the various governments, and in 1868 a
second diplomatic conference was convened at Geneva at which were voted
additional articles, improving the treaty by completing its design and
extending its beneficial action to maritime warfare.

During the war of 1866 no decisive trial of the new principles involved
in the treaty could be made, for Austria at that time had not adopted
it. But in 1870-71 it was otherwise. The belligerents, both France and
Germany, had accepted the treaty. Thus it became possible to show to the
world the immense service and beneficent results which the treaty,
through the relief societies, might accomplish.

The dullest apprehension can partially appreciate the responsibility
incurred by relief societies in time of war. The thoughtful mind will
readily perceive that these responsibilities involve constant vigilance
and effort during periods of peace. It is wise statesmanship which
suggests that in time of peace we must prepare for war, and it is no
less a wise benevolence that makes preparation in the hour of peace for
assuaging the ills that are sure to accompany war. We do not wait till
battles are upon us to provide efficient soldiery and munitions of war.
Everything that foresight and caution can devise to insure success is
made ready and kept ready against the time of need. It is equally
necessary to hold ourselves in readiness for effective service in the
mitigation of evils consequent upon war, if humane work is to be
undertaken for that purpose.

Permanent armies are organized, drilled and supported for the actual
service in war. It is no less incumbent if we would do efficient work in
alleviating the sufferings caused by the barbarisms of war, that we
should organize philanthropic efforts and be ready with whatever is
necessary, to be on the field at the sound of the first gun. An
understanding of this truth led the conference of 1863 to embody in its
articles as one of its first cardinal characteristics the following: "In
time of peace the committee will occupy itself with means to render
genuine assistance in time of war."

The International Committee assumed that there should be a relief
association in every country which endorsed the treaty, and so generally
was the idea accepted that at the end of the year 1864, when only ten
governments had been added to the convention, twenty-five committees had
been formed, under each of which relief societies were organized. It
was, however, only after the wars of 1864, 1866 and 1870 that the
movement began really to be popular. These conflicts brought not only
contestants, but neutral powers so to appreciate the horrors of war,
that they were quite ready to acknowledge the beneficence and wisdom of
the Geneva Treaty. Many who approved the humane idea and expressed a
hearty sympathy for the object to be obtained, had heretofore regarded
it as Utopian, a thing desirable but not attainable, an amiable and
fanatical illusion which would ever elude the practical grasp.
Nevertheless, the work accomplished during the wars referred to won over
not only such cavillers, but persons actually hostile to the movement,
to regard it as a practical and most beneficent undertaking. The crowned
heads of Europe were quick to perceive the benign uses of the
associations, and bestowed upon the central committees of their
countries money, credit and personal approbation. The families of
sovereigns contributed their sympathy and material support. The list of
princes and princesses who came forward with personal aid and assumed
direction of the work, was by no means small, thus proving correct the
augury of the Conference of 1863, that "The governments would accord
their high protection to the committees in their organization."

From one of the bulletins of the International Committee we make the
following hopeful extract:

"The whole of Europe is marshaled under the banner of the Red Cross. To
its powerful and peaceful sign the committee hopes to bring all the
civilized nations of the earth. Wherever men fight and tear each other
in pieces, wherever the glare and roar of war are heard, they aim to
plant the white banner that bears the blessed sign of relief. Already
they have carried it into Asia. Their ensign waves in Siberia, on the
Chinese frontier, and in Turkestan, and, through the African committee,
in Algeria and Egypt. Oceanica has a committee at Batavia. Japan
accepted the Treaty of Geneva in 1886, and on the breaking out of
hostilities between Japan and China, the Minister of War issued a
notification to the Japanese army, September 22, 1894, calling their
attention to the substance of the treaty."


ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF WORK.

One of the things considered indispensable, and therefore adopted as a
resolution by the Conference of 1863, was the centralization of the work
in each country separately by itself.

While the treaty must be universally acknowledged and its badge accepted
as a universal sign, it was equally essential that the societies of the
different countries should be simply national and in no respect
international. It was therefore ordained by the conference that all
local committees or organizations desirous of working with the Red
Cross, should do so under the auspices of the Central Committee of their
own nation, which is recognized by its government and also recognized by
the International Committee from which the sign of the Red Cross
emanates. Singularly enough, the International Committee has had
considerable difficulty in making this fully understood, and frequently
has been obliged to suggest to local committees the necessity for their
subordination to the Central or National Committee. Once in three months
the International Committee publishes an official list of all central
committees recognized by it as national. In this way it is able to
exercise a certain control, and to repress entanglements and abuses
which would become consequent on irresponsible or counterfeit
organizations. To recapitulate: the Commission of Geneva, of which M.
Moynier is president, is the only International Committee. All other
committees are simply national or subordinate to national committees.
The Conference of 1863 foresaw that national differences would prevent a
universal code of management, and that to make the societies
international would destroy them, so far as efficiency was concerned.
They therefore adopted a resolution that "Central committees should
organize in such a manner as seemed the most useful and convenient to
themselves." Every committee being its own judge, has its own
constitution and laws. To be efficient, it must have the recognition of
its own government, must bear the stamp of national individuality and be
constructed according to the spirit, habits and needs of the country it
represents. No hierarchy unites the national societies; they are
independent of each other, but they have each an individual
responsibility to the treaty, under the ensign of which they work, and
they labor in a common cause. It is desirable that they should all be
known by one name, namely, the Society of the Red Cross. The functions
of the International Committee, whose headquarters are at Geneva, were
also determined by the Conference of 1863. It is to serve provisionally
as an intermediate agent between national committees, and to facilitate
their communications with each other. It occupies itself with the
general interests of the Red Cross in correspondence, and the study of
theoretical and practical methods of amelioration and relief.

The national committees are charged with the direction and
responsibility for the work in their own countries. They must provide
resources to be utilized in time of need, take active measures to secure
adherents, establish local societies, and have an efficient working
force always in readiness for action, and in time of war to dispatch and
distribute safely and wisely all accumulations of material and supplies,
nurses and assistants, to their proper destination, and, in short,
whatever may be gathered from the patriotism and philanthropy of the
country. They must always remember that central committees without
abundant sectional branches would be of little use.

In most countries the co-operation of women has been eagerly sought. It
is needless to say it has been as eagerly given. In some countries the
central committees are mixed, both sexes working together; in others,
sub-committees are formed by women, and in others, such as the Grand
Duchy of Baden, woman leads.

As a last detail of organization, the Conference of 1863 recommended to
the central committees to put themselves _en rapport_ with their
respective governments, in order that their offers of service should be
accepted when required. This makes it incumbent upon national societies
to obtain and hold government recognition, by which they are endowed
with the immunities and privileges of legally constituted bodies and
with recognition from other nations in time of war, not otherwise
possible to them.


OCCUPATIONS OF RELIEF SOCIETIES IN TIMES OF PEACE.

Organization, recognition and communication are by no means all that is
necessary to insure the fulfillment of the objects of these
associations. A thing most important to be borne in mind is that if
money be necessary for war, it is also an indispensable agent in relief
of the miseries occasioned by war. Self-devotion alone will not answer.
The relief societies need funds and other resources to carry on their
work. They not only require means for current expenses, but, most of
all, for possible emergencies. To obtain and prudently conserve these
resources is an important work. The Russian Society set a good example
of activity in this direction. From the beginning of its organization in
1867 it systematically collected money over the whole empire and
neglected nothing that tended to success. It put boxes in churches,
convents, armories, railroad depots, steamboats, in every place
frequented by the public. Beside the collection of funds, the Conference
of 1863 recommended that peace periods should be occupied in gathering
necessary material for service. In 1868 there were in Geneva alone five
depots where were accumulated one thousand two hundred and twenty-eight
shirts, besides hosiery, bandages, lint, etc., for over one thousand
wounded. There were also large collections in the provinces, and now,
thirty years later, these accumulations have probably greatly increased.
In other countries the supplies remaining after wars were gathered in
depots and were added to abundantly. Thus, in 1868, the Berlin Committee
was in possession of supplies worth over twenty-five thousand dollars.
Especial care is taken to acquire familiarity with the use of all
sanitary material, to eliminate as far as possible whatever may be
prejudicial to sick or wounded men, to improve both sanitary system and
all supplies to be used under it, to have everything of the very best,
as surgical instruments, medicine chests, bandages, stretchers, wagons,
tents and field hospitals.

We would refer to the effort made in the national exhibitions of the
various countries, where the societies of the Red Cross have displayed
their practical improvements and inventions in competitive fields,
taxing to the utmost human ingenuity and skill. Some countries have
taken grand prizes. An exposition at The Hague was held in 1867
exclusively for the work of the Red Cross. Permanent museums have been
established where all sorts of sanitary material for relief are
exhibited, as may be seen in Stockholm, Carlsruhe, St. Petersburg,
Moscow and Paris. The museum of Paris is the most important of all, and
is international, other countries having participated in its foundation.
Another method is the publication of works bearing upon this subject,
some of which are scientific and very valuable. Not less important is
the sanitary personnel. Of all aid, efficient nurses are the most
difficult to obtain. There are numbers of men and women who have the
will and devotion necessary to lead them into hospitals or to
battlefields, but very few of them are capable of performing well the
duties of nurses. Therefore, but a small portion of the volunteers are
available. The relief societies soon found that women were by nature
much better fitted for this duty than men can be, and to enable them to
fulfill to the best advantage the mission for which they are so well
adapted, it was decided to afford them the best possible professional
instruction. For this purpose, during peace training schools were
established from which were graduated great numbers of women who are
ready at a moment's notice to go upon the battlefield or into hospitals.
These professional nurses find no difficulty during times of peace in
securing remunerative employment. Indeed, they are eagerly sought for by
the community to take positions at the bedside of the sick, with the
proviso that they are to be allowed to obey the pledge of their society
at the first tocsin of war. There are schools for this purpose in
England, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Russia and other European countries,
and nothing has been neglected to make them thorough and to place them
on a strong and solid basis.


SERVICES IN TIME OF WAR.

Notwithstanding the readiness with which most persons will perceive the
beneficent uses of relief societies in war, it may not be amiss to
particularize some of the work accomplished by the societies of the Red
Cross. Not to mention civil disturbances and lesser conflicts, they
participated in not less than five great wars in the first ten years,
commencing with Schleswig-Holstein, and ending with the Franco-German.
Russia and Turkey have followed, with many others since that time, in
all of which these societies have signally proved their power to
ameliorate the horrors of war. The earlier of these, while affording
great opportunity for the beneficent work of the societies, were also
grand fields of instruction and discipline to the committee, enabling
them to store up vast funds of practical knowledge which were to be of
great service.

The Sanitary Commission of the United States also served as an excellent
example in many respects to the relief societies of Europe, and from it
they took many valuable lessons. Thus in 1866 Europe was much better
prepared than ever before for the care of those who suffered from the
barbarisms of war. She was now ready with some degree of ability to
oppose the arms of charity to the arms of violence, and make a kind of
war on war itself. Still however there was a lack of centralization. The
provincial committees worked separately, and consequently lost force.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks, large amounts of money were gathered,
and munificent supplies of material brought into store. The Austrian
Committee alone collected 2,170,000 francs, and a great supply of all
things needed in hospital service. The Central Committee was of great
use in facilitating correspondence between the different peoples
comprising the Austrian Empire, the bureau maintaining correspondence in
eleven different languages.

Italy was not backward in the performance of her duty. She used her
abundant resources in the most effectual way. Not only were her
provincial societies of relief united for common action, but they
received external aid from France and Switzerland. Here was exhibited
the first beautiful example of neutral powers interfering in the cause
of charity in time of war--instead of joining in the work of
destruction, lending their aid to repair its damages. The provincial
committees banded together under the Central Committee of Milan. Four
squads, comprising well-trained nurses and assistants, were organized
and furnished with all necessary material to follow the military
ambulances or field hospitals, whose wagons were placed at their
disposal.

Thus the committee not only reinforced the sanitary _personnel_ of the
army, but greatly increased its supplies. It provided entirely the
sanitary material for the Tyrolese volunteers, and afforded relief to
the navy, and when the war was over it remained among the wounded. In
addition to the supplies this committee afforded, it expended in money
not less than 199,064 francs.

But after all it was Germany standing between the two armies which
distinguished herself. Since the Conference of 1863 she had been acting
on the rule of preparation, and now found herself in readiness for all
emergencies. The Central Committee of Berlin was flooded with
contributions from the provincial committees. In the eight provinces of
Prussia 4,000,000 of thalers were collected, and the other states of
Germany were not behind. So munificently did the people bestow their
aid, that large storehouses were provided in Berlin and in the provinces
for its reception, and at the central depot in Berlin two hundred paid
persons, besides a large number of volunteers, and nearly three hundred
ladies and misses were employed in classifying, parceling, packing up,
and dispatching the goods. Special railroad trains carried material to
the points of need. In one train were twenty-six cars laden with 1800 to
2000 cwt. of supplies. Never had private charity, however carefully
directed, been able to accomplish such prodigies of benevolence. It was
now that the beneficence of the Treaty and the excellence of the
organization were manifested. But the committee did not confine itself
to sending supplies for the wounded to the seat of war. It established
and provisioned refreshment stations for the trains, to which those
unable to proceed on the trains to the great hospitals without danger to
life, were admitted, nursed and cared for with the tenderest solicitude
until they were sufficiently recovered to be removed, or death took
them. At the station of Pardubitz from six hundred to eight hundred were
cared for daily for two months, and lodging provided for three hundred
at night. This example suffices to show the extraordinary results of
well-organized plans and concerted action. During the war, the relief
societies had also to contend with the terrible scourge of cholera.
There can be no estimate of the misery assuaged and deaths prevented by
the unselfish zeal and devotion of the wearers of the Red Cross.

In the interval between the wars of 1866 and 1867, and that of 1870-71,
the time had been improved by the societies existing under the Geneva
Treaty, in adding to their resources in every possible manner.
Improvements were made in all articles of sanitary service; excellent
treatises regarding the hygiene of the camp and hospital were widely
circulated; the press had greatly interested itself in the promulgation
of information regarding all matters of interest or instruction
pertaining to sanitary effort, and almost universally lent its powerful
influence to build up the societies. Ten new societies were formed
during this time. In Germany the work of the Red Cross was so thoroughly
organized, that at the first signal from Berlin, committees arrived as
if by magic at all required points, forming a chain which extended over
the whole country, and numbered over two thousand persons. This is more
remarkable since Germany was a neutral power. Constant communication was
kept up between these committees and the central bureau, and the most
perfect order and discipline were maintained. Relief was sent from one
or another of these stations as was needed. The state afforded free
transport, and the voluntary contributions of the people kept up the
supplies of sanitary material, so that there was never any lack or
danger of failure. With the government transports, whether by land or
water, there went always the agents of the Red Cross, protected by their
badges and flag, to wait on the invoices, hasten their progress, see to
their being kept in good order, and properly delivered at their
destination. Depots of supplies were moved from place to place as
exigencies demanded. The greatest care was taken to prevent disorder or
confusion, and the best military circumspection and regularity
prevailed. The great central depot at Berlin comprised seven sections,
viz: Camp material; clothing; dressing, for wounds; surgical apparatus;
medicines and disinfectants; food and tobacco; and hospital furnishings.
Did space allow, it would be desirable to give statistics of the
contributions in money and supplies to this service. Suffice it to say,
the humanity of peoples is far beyond that of governments. Governments
appropriate immense sums to carry on destructive conflicts, but the work
of relief societies the world over, and especially during the war of
1870-71, has shown that the philanthropy of the people equals their
patriotism. The sums given to assuage the miseries of the
Franco-Prussian war were simply fabulous. In 1863, fears were expressed
that there would be difficulty in collecting needful funds and supplies
to carry out the designs of the treaty. These misgivings proved
groundless. After the war of 1870-71, notwithstanding nothing had been
withheld in the way of relief, the societies settled their accounts with
large balances in their treasuries.

In France not nearly so much had been previously done to provide for the
exigencies which fell upon them, but the committee worked with such
vigor and so wrought upon the philanthropy of individuals, that active
measures of relief were instantly taken. Gold and supplies poured into
the hands of the committee at Paris. One month sufficed to organize and
provide seventeen campaign ambulances or field hospitals, which
immediately joined the army and accompanied it through the first period
of the war, or until the battle of Sedan. In Paris ambulances were
stationed at the railroad depots to pick up the wounded, and a bureau of
information was created for soldiers' families. When the siege of Paris
was about to take place, the committee threw, without delay, a
commission into Brussels charged with the direction and help of flying
hospitals. Nine committees were established in the provinces, with power
to act for the Central Committee and to invite the people to help.
Meanwhile the committee in Paris did its utmost to mitigate the distress
that reigned there, and to prepare for the result of the siege. History
has recorded the sufferings, the horrors of misery that accompanied and
followed that siege; but history can never relate what wretchedness was
averted, what agonies were alleviated, what multitudes of lives were
saved, by the presence and effort of the relief societies! What the
state of France must have been without the merciful help of the Red
Cross societies the imagination dare not picture. After the armistice
was signed there were removed from Paris, under the auspices of the
relief societies, ten thousand wounded men, who otherwise must have
lingered in agony, or died from want of care; and there were brought
back by them to French soil nine thousand men who had been cared for in
German hospitals.


HELP FROM NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.

Neutral countries also during this war were ready and bountiful with
help; and those working under the treaty did most effectual service.
England contributed 7,500,000 francs, besides large gifts of sanitary
supplies; in one hundred and eighty-eight days' time she sent to the
seat of war twelve thousand boxes of supplies through the agents of the
Red Cross.

To give an idea of the readiness and efficacy with which the committees
worked even in neutral countries, one instance will suffice. From
Pont-a-Mousson a telegram was sent to London for two hundred and fifty
iron beds for the wounded, and in forty-eight hours they arrived in
answer to the request. England kept also at the seat of war agents to
inform the committee at home of whatever was most needed in supplies.
The neutral countries sent also surgeons, physicians and nurses, and in
many other ways gave practical testimony to the benign efficacy of the
Geneva treaty.

As will be seen by the foregoing pages, the objects and provisions of
the Geneva convention and the societies acting under it, are designed
for, and applicable to, the exigencies of war only. The close contact of
the nations hitherto signing this treaty, renders them far more liable
to the recurrence of war among them than our own, which by its
geographical position and distance from neighboring nations, entertains
a feeling of security which justifies the hope that we may seldom, if
ever again, have occasion to provide for the exigencies of war in our
land.

This leads the American Red Cross to perceive the great wisdom,
foresight and breadth of the resolution adopted by the convention of
1863, which provides that "Committees shall organize in the manner which
shall seem most useful and convenient to themselves;" also in their
article on the organization of societies in these pages occurs the
following: "To be efficient, societies must have government recognition,
must bear the stamp of their national individuality, and be constructed
according to the spirit, habits, and needs of the country they
represent. This is essential to success."

As no work can retain its vitality without constant action, so in a
country like ours, with a people of so active a temperament, an
essential element in endearing to them a work, is to keep constantly
before them its usefulness. With this view the question of meeting the
want heretofore felt on all occasions of public calamity, of sufficient
extent to be deemed of national importance, has received attention at
the hands of this association. For this purpose the necessary steps have
been inaugurated to organize auxiliary societies, prepared to co-operate
with the central association in all plans for prompt relief; whilst the
volunteers who shall render personal aid will be expected to hold
themselves in the same readiness as in the case of an international
call.

It must, however, be distinctly understood that these additional
functions for local purposes shall in no manner impair the international
obligation of the association; but on the contrary it is believed will
render them more effective in time of need.

It may appear singular that a movement so humane in its purposes, so
wise and well considered in its regulations, so universal in its
application, and every way so unexceptional, should have been so long in
finding its way to the knowledge and consideration of the people of the
United States. This fact appears to have been the result of
circumstances rather than intention. While eminently a reading people,
we are almost exclusively confined to the English language. The
literature of the Red Cross is entirely in other languages, largely
French, and thus has failed to meet the eye of the reading public.

It will be observed that the first convention was called during our war;
no delegates were especially sent by the United States, but our Minister
Plenipotentiary to Switzerland, acting as delegate, sent a copy of the
doings of the convention to our government for recognition. In the midst
of civil war as we were at the time the subject was very naturally and
properly declined.

[Illustration: FIRST LETTER FROM M. GUSTAV MOYNIER TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, URGING THE ADOPTION OF THE TREATY OF GENEVA.]

It was again most fittingly presented in 1866 through Rev. Dr. Henry W.
Bellows, and by this eminent gentleman and philanthropist a Society of
the Red Cross was actually formed; but for some cause it failed, and the
convention was not recognized. The International Committee became in a
manner discouraged in its efforts with the United States, but finally it
was decided to present it again through Miss Clara Barton, and
accordingly the following letter was addressed to President Hayes during
the first year of his administration:

                             INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR
                                 THE RELIEF OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS,

                                                GENEVA, _August 19, 1877_.

  _To the President of the United States, at Washington_:

  MR. PRESIDENT: The International Committee of the Red Cross desires
  most earnestly that the United States should be associated with them
  in their work, and they take the liberty of addressing themselves to
  you, with the hope that you will second their efforts. In order that
  the functions of the National Society of the Red Cross be faithfully
  performed, it is indispensable that it should have the sympathy and
  protection of the government.

  It would be irrational to establish an association upon the
  principles of the Convention of Geneva, without the association
  having the assurance that the army of its own country, of which it
  should be an auxiliary, would be guided, should the case occur, by
  the same principles. It would consequently be useless for us to
  appeal to the people of the country, inasmuch as the United States,
  as a government, has made no declaration of adhering officially to
  the principles laid down by the convention of the twenty-second
  August, 1864.

  Such is then, Mr. President, the principal object of the present
  request. We do not doubt but this will meet with a favorable
  reception from you, for the United States is in advance of Europe
  upon the subject of war, and the celebrated "Instructions of the
  American Army" are a monument which does honor to the United States.

  You are aware, Mr. President, that the Government of the United
  States was officially represented at the Convention of Geneva, in
  1864, by two delegates, and this mark of approbation given to the
  work which was being accomplished was then considered by every one
  as a precursor of a legal ratification. Until the present time,
  however, this confirmation has not taken place, and we think that
  this formality, which would have no other bearing than to express
  publicly the acquiescence of the United States in those humanitarian
  principles now admitted by all civilized people, has only been
  retarded because the occasion has not offered itself. We flatter
  ourselves with the hope that, appealing directly to your generous
  sentiments, will determine you to take the necessary measures to put
  an end to a situation so much to be regretted. We only wait such
  good news, Mr. President, in order to urge the founding of an
  American Society of the Red Cross.

  We have already an able and devoted assistant in Miss Clara Barton,
  to whom we confide the care of handing to you this present request.

  It would be very desirable that the projected asseveration should be
  under your distinguished patronage, and we hope that you will not
  refuse us this favor.

  Receive, Mr. President, the assurance of our highest consideration.

  For the International Committee:
                                             G. MOYNIER, _President_.

[Illustration: AUTOGRAPH ENDORSEMENT BY PRESIDENT GARFIELD.

                                      EXECUTIVE MANSION,
                                                       WASHINGTON.

                       Will the Secy
                       of State please
                       hear Miss Barton
                       on the subject
                       herein referred
                       to
                         J.A. Garfield

                       March 30, 1881.]

This letter was sent to Miss Barton, who, having labored with committees
of the Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian war, thus becoming familiar
with its methods, was very naturally selected as the bearer of the
letter, and the exponent of the cause. Moreover, foreign nations had
secured her promise to present it to the government on her return to her
country and endeavor to make its principles understood among the people.

Accordingly the letter was presented by Miss Barton to President Hayes
and by him referred to his Secretary of State, but as no action was
taken, and no promise of any action given, it was not deemed advisable
to proceed to the organization of societies formed with special
reference to acting under the regulations of a governmental treaty
having no present existence, and no guaranty of any in the future.

Thus it remained until the incoming of the administration of President
Garfield when a copy of the letter of Mr. Moynier was presented by Miss
Barton to President Garfield, very cordially received by him, and
endorsed to Secretary Blaine; from whom after full consideration of the
subject the following letter was received:

                                       DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
                                            WASHINGTON, _May 20, 1881_.

  MISS CLARA BARTON, _American Representative of the Red Cross, etc.,
      Washington_:

  DEAR MADAM: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the
  letter addressed by Mr. Moynier, President of the Red Cross
  International Convention, to the President of the United States,
  bearing the date of the nineteenth August, 1877, and referred by
  President Garfield on the thirtieth March, 1881, to this
  department.

  It appears, from a careful perusal of the letter, that Mr. Moynier
  is anxious that the Government of the United States should join with
  other governments of the world in this International Convention.

  Will you be pleased to say to Mr. Moynier, in reply to his letter,
  that the President of the United States, and the officers of this
  government, are in full sympathy with any wise measures tending
  toward the amelioration of the suffering incident to warfare. The
  constitution of the United States has, however, lodged the entire
  war-making power in the Congress of the United States; and, as the
  participation of the United States in an International Convention of
  this character is consequent upon and auxiliary to the war-making
  power of the nation, legislation by Congress is needful to
  accomplish the humane end that your society has in view. It gives
  me, however, great pleasure to state that I shall be happy to give
  any measures which you may propose careful attention and
  consideration, and should the President, as I doubt not he will,
  approve of the matter, the administration will recommend to Congress
  the adoption of the international treaty which you desire.

  I am, madam, with very great respect, your obedient servant,
                                                     JAMES G. BLAINE.

On the twenty-fifth of June the following letter from Mr. Moynier,
president of the International Committee of Geneva, in reply to the
preceding letter of Secretary Blaine, was received by Miss Barton, and
duly presented at the State department:

                                             GENEVA, _June 13, 1881_.

  To the Honorable Secretary of State, JAMES G. BLAINE, _Washington_:

  SIR: Miss Clara Barton has just communicated to me the letter which
  she has had the honor to receive from you, bearing date of May 20,
  1881, and I hasten to express to you how much satisfaction I have
  experienced from it. I do not doubt now, thanks to your favorable
  consideration and that of President Garfield, that the United States
  may soon be counted among the number of signers of the Geneva
  Convention, since you have been kind enough to allow me to hope that
  the proposition for it will be made to Congress by the
  administration.

  I thank you, as well as President Garfield, for having been willing
  to take into serious consideration the wish contained in my letter
  of August 19, 1877, assuredly a very natural wish, since it tended
  to unite your country with a work of humanity and civilization for
  which it is one of the best qualified.

  Since my letter of 1877 was written, several new governmental
  adhesions have been given to the Geneva Convention, and I think that
  these precedents will be much more encouraging to the United States
  from the fact that they have been given by America. It was under the
  influence of events of the recent war of the Pacific that Bolivia
  signed the treaty the 16th of October, 1879, Chili on the 15th of
  November, 1879, Argentine Republic on the 25th of November, 1879,
  and Peru on the 22d of April, 1881. This argument in favor of the
  adhesion of your country is the only one I can add to my request,
  and to the printed documents that Miss Barton has placed in your
  hands, to aid your judgment and that of Congress.

  I now await with full confidence the final result of your
  sympathetic efforts, and I beg you to accept, sir, the assurance of
  my high consideration.

                                          G. MOYNIER, _President_.

[Illustration: SOME OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN
               NATIONAL RED CROSS.]

[Illustration: A GROUP OF AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS MEMBERS.]

The very cordial and frank expressions of sympathy contained
in Secretary Blaine's letter gave assurance of the acceptance of the
terms of the treaty by the government at no distant day, and warranted
the formation of societies. Accordingly a meeting was held in
Washington, D.C., May 21, 1881, which resulted in the formation
of an association to be known as the American [National] Association
of the Red Cross. A constitution was adopted, a copy of which follows:

THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.

  _The proceedings of this Conference and what led up to it we learn
     chiefly from the historical report of the Conference by Mr.
     Gustav Moynier and Dr. Louis Appia, of the International
     Committee of the Red Cross. It was the work of this Conference
     that laid the foundation for the Treaty of Geneva, adopted in the
     following year._

In the year 1864, Europe was covered, as if by enchantment, with a
network of committees for the relief of wounded soldiers; and this
phenomenon would have led the least discerning persons to suspect that
this special work was entering on a new phase. Several of these
committees had already begun to exercise their functions in the
Schleswig-Holstein war, yet all unanimously proclaimed that they would
constitute themselves as permanent institutions, and, in a great
measure, they seemed to obey one watch-word. All, in fact, declared in
their charter of establishment, that they would conform to the
resolutions of the Geneva Conference.

What, then, was this conference, whose magic wand had, so to speak,
electrified all nations? It seems too important an historical fact to be
passed over in silence, because we feel certain that an inquiry into its
nature, and how it arose, will prove highly interesting.

1. It originated with the SociÃ©tÃ© Genevoise d'utilitÃ© publique, which
had undertaken to contribute toward the progress of philanthropy. At its
sitting of the ninth of February, 1863, it discussed the question, in
accordance with the proposition of one of its members, M. Henri Dunant,
whether means might not be found to form, during a time of peace and
tranquillity, relief societies, whose aim should be to help the wounded
in time of war by means of volunteers, zealous, devoted and well
qualified for such work.

Although it had no very clear idea of what should be done, in order to
obtain the result which seemed desirable, the society took the matter
under its patronage, and entrusted the examination of it to a special
commission, with full power to act.

The course to be pursued was long debated in this little committee, the
members of which finally agreed to submit the question to more competent
judges. It was, in fact, necessary, before encouraging the formation of
societies of volunteers, to know whether any need for them had been
felt, and whether they would not be regarded with a jealous eye by the
administrative or military authorities. It was also necessary to
determine what should be the nature of their action under various social
and political forms of government. In order not to venture recklessly on
a road bristling with obstacles, it was therefore evident that they
ought to take as guides experienced men, versed in the practice of war,
and belonging to different nationalities. An International Conference
appeared to be indispensable to the work, as a basis or starting point.
If, after this ordeal, the first idea, upon which the most divergent
opinions were even then professed, should be recognized as
impracticable, its partisans would at least possess the consolation of
having done their best. We shall have, said one of them, the approval of
our consciences, and the feeling that we have done that which it is
right men should do who love their neighbor. If, on the contrary, the
thing were pronounced to be good, useful and acceptable, what
encouragement such a decision would afford them to launch out upon their
course! What moral force they who should first put themselves in the
breach would receive! It was not a time to hesitate. The circular
convoking the meeting was issued on the first of September, 1863.

Nothing was neglected that could give the greatest publicity to this
appeal. It was brought specially to the notice of the International
Statistical Congress, sitting at Berlin, in the month of September,
1863, which expressed an opinion entirely favorable to the project.

At length the day fixed for the opening of the Conference arrived. On
the morning of the twenty-sixth of October, in the rooms of the AthenÃ¦um
at Geneva, might be seen an assembly composed of eighteen official
delegates, representing fourteen governments, six delegates of different
associations, seven unaccredited visitors, with five members of the
Geneva Committee. It was sufficient to glance over the list of the
thirty-six members of the Conference, to understand that the expectation
of its promoters was attained, and even surpassed, and that their
initiative had already found its reward in the meeting of such a body.
It was impossible that a deliberation among men so eminently qualified
should not throw the fullest light on the question submitted to them.
The committee tells us that the eagerness with which the invitation was
responded to soon justified the propriety of the step it had taken. It
became convinced that, in drawing public attention to the insufficiency
of the official sanitary service, it had touched a sensitive chord, and
had responded to a universal wish. It was also convinced that it was not
pursuing a chimerical object. If, for a moment, it had feared that its
project would only attract mere dreamers and Utopians, it was reassured
on seeing that it had to deal with men in earnest, with medical and
military magnates. It also received much encouragement from persons who
were prevented from taking part in the debates, but who testified to the
lively interest they took in them.

It was then, with the most happy auspices that General Dufour opened the
Conference, which lasted four days, under the presidency of M. Moynier,
president of the Genevoise Society of Public Utility, and the
vice-presidency of His Highness Prince Henry XIII., of Reuss, the
delegate of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Every one seemed
animated by the best motives, and desirous not to lose so good an
opportunity to open a new arena for the cause of charity. It was
interesting to witness the general unanimity, as new as it was
spontaneous, on a question of humanity instantaneously developed into
one of philanthropic urgency. Dr. Landa, delegate of the Spanish
Government, well expressed the sentiment of the assembly when he
exclaimed, "Oh, that we may be so happy as to discover the basis which
shall render the the useful institution we aspire to found durable and
effectual!" The magnitude of the result which may be obtained, and the
tears which may be wiped away, demand that we should devote all our
efforts to attain it; and if this work be realized, it will be an event
which all friends of humanity will be able to hail with the greatest
joy. We feel, said the president of the Conference, that a great duty is
imposed upon us, and we shall not rest until we have found means to
lessen for our fellow-creatures the privations, the sufferings and the
evils of all kinds which are the inevitable consequences of an armed
contest.

So much good-will was not superfluous, in order to accomplish the
arduous task of the Conference. For what, indeed, was it laboring? For
nothing less than to reconcile two opposites--charity and war. The
propriety of voluntary aid being admitted, it was necessary to leave it
sufficiently free, in order that zeal might not be cooled by
unreasonable conditions; yet, at the same time, to subject it to a
certain discipline, so that it might have access to the army without
being an encumbrance to it. Here was the real problem to be solved. Here
was a link to be established between the civil and the military, which,
though opposed, are not necessarily incompatible, and should be
encouraged to live fraternally side by side. The experience of modern
wars seemed to justify this inquiry, for it was averred that here the
administration of voluntary offerings had been defective. Besides, the
question presented itself in a new character, owing to the fact that a
staff of volunteers occupied an important place in it. If this view of
the case was to take precedence of all others, nothing less than a
complete revolution was intended, and its importance being acknowledged,
it would have been wrong to engage in it otherwise than earnestly. It
was for discussion to reveal the opinion that was entertained of it.

Independently of all that was difficult in the very nature of the
subject with which the conference was to occupy itself, it met with
another obstacle, in the consideration which it was obliged to give to
the different forms of government under which civilized nations dwell.

It is certain that a relief committee would be bound to modify its
conduct, and its hands would be more or less free, according to the
political or social circle in which it would have its existence. For
example, where individual initiative is highly developed, as in
Switzerland and America, there will be found liberty for the efforts of
free societies which would not be tolerated to the same degree in France
or Austria. The consequence of this situation was, that, called to draw
up a code of military philanthropy for the use of all nations, the
Conference could only advocate general principles, so that its decisions
might be everywhere acceptable.

Here it took its stand, and following the advice of its president, it
left to each society the duty of regulating minute details as it might
judge expedient. It wisely confined its ambition to the construction of
a solid foundation for the monument which it wished to erect, and which
was perhaps destined to become one of the glories of our century.

Let us now give heed to the voice of the Conference, and let us cast our
eyes over the resolutions, placed side by side with the _propositions_
presented by the Geneva Committee, under the title of _Projet de
Concordat_. It is evident, indeed, from a comparison of these two
documents that the first ideas were true, since they have only been
slightly modified. The authors of this project, however, offer it as the
eminently perfectible fruit of their first meditations, and as a basis
which they deemed it right to furnish to the Conference, in order to
guide it in its labors.

GENERAL PROVISIONS.

  ARTICLE 1. There shall be, in each of the contracting countries, a
  national committee, whose duty shall consist in remedying, by all
  the means in its power, the inadequacy of the official sanitary
  service of the armies in active service.

  This committee shall organize itself in the manner which may appear
  to it the most useful and expedient.

  ART. 2. Sections, unlimited in number, shall be founded, in order to
  second the national committee. These shall be necessarily
  subordinate to the committee, to which alone shall belong the
  supreme direction.

  ART. 3. Every national committee shall place itself in communication
  with the government of its own country, and shall ascertain that its
  efforts of service will be accepted in case of war.

  ART. 4. In time of peace, the committees and their sections shall
  occupy themselves with improvements to be introduced in the military
  sanitary service, in the establishment of ambulances and hospitals,
  in the means of transports for the wounded, etc., and in pursuing
  the realization of these objects.

  ART. 5. The committees and sections of the different countries shall
  reassemble in international congresses, in order to communicate the
  result of their experience, and to concert together on the measures
  to be taken in the interests of the work.

  ART. 6. In the month of January every year, the national committees
  shall present a report of their labors during the past year, adding
  to it such communications as they may consider useful to be brought
  to the knowledge of the committees of other countries. The exchange
  of these communications and reports shall be managed through the
  medium of the Geneva committee, to whom they shall be addressed.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS IN CASE OF WAR.

  ART. 7. In case of war, the committees of the belligerent nations
  shall furnish the necessary aid to their respective armies, and, in
  particular, shall provide for the formation and organization of
  corps of volunteer nurses.

  They shall solicit the support of the committees belonging to
  neutral nations.

  ART. 8. The volunteer nurses shall bind themselves to serve during a
  limited time, and not in any way to meddle in the operations of the
  war.

  They shall be employed, according to their wish, in field service or
  in that of the hospitals. Females will necessarily be assigned to
  the latter.

  ART. 9. The volunteer nurses shall wear a uniform in all countries,
  or an identical distinctive badge. Their person shall be sacred, and
  military chiefs shall afford them protection.

  At the commencement of a campaign, the soldiers of both armies shall
  be informed of the existence of these corps, and of their
  exclusively benevolent character.


RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONFERENCE.

  The International Conference, desirous to give aid to the wounded
  soldiers in all cases where the military medical service shall be
  inadequate, has adopted the following resolutions:

  ARTICLE 1. There shall be in every country a committee whose duty it
  will be to co-operate in time of war by all the means in its power,
  with the sanitary service of the army.

  This committee shall organize itself in the manner which may appear
  to it as the most useful and expedient.

  ART. 2. Sections, unlimited in number, shall be formed, in order to
  second the committee, to which the general direction will belong.

  ART. 3. Every committee shall place itself in communication with the
  government of its own country, in order that its offers of
  assistance, in case of need, may be accepted.

  ART. 4. In time of peace the committees and sections shall be
  occupied with the means to make themselves really useful in time of
  war, especially in preparing material aid of every kind, and in
  endeavoring to train and instruct volunteer nurses.

  ART. 5. In the event of war, the committees of the belligerent
  nations shall furnish relief to their respective armies in
  proportion to their resources; in particular, they shall organize
  and place the volunteer nurses on an active footing, and, in
  conjunction with the military authority, they shall arrange places
  for the reception of the wounded.

  They shall solicit the assistance of the committees belonging to
  neutral nations.

  ART. 6. On the demand, or with the concurrence, of the military
  authority, the committees shall send volunteer nurses to the field
  of battle. They shall there place them under the direction of the
  military chiefs.

  ART. 7. The volunteer nurses employed with armies shall be provided,
  by their respective committees, with everything necessary for their
  maintenance.

  ART. 8. They shall wear, in all countries, a white band around the
  arm with a Red Cross upon it, as a distinctive and uniform badge.

  ART. 9. The committees and sections of the different countries shall
  meet in International Conference, in order to communicate to each
  other the results of their experience, and to decide on the measures
  to be adopted for the advancement of the work.

  ART. 10. The exchange of communications between the committees of
  the different nations shall be made provisionally through the medium
  of the Committee of Geneva.

  Independently of the above resolutions, the Conference expressed the
  following wishes:

  A. That the governments should grant protection to the national
  committees which may be formed, and should, as far as possible,
  facilitate the accomplishment of their task.

  B. That, in time of war, neutrality should be proclaimed by the
  belligerent nations for the field and stationary hospitals, and that
  it may also be accorded, in the most complete manner, to all
  officials employed in sanitary work, to volunteer nurses, to the
  inhabitants of the country who shall assist the wounded, and to the
  wounded themselves.

  That an incidental distinctive sign be adopted for the medical corps
  of all armies, or, at least, for all persons attached to this
  service in the same army.

  That an identical flag be also adopted for the field and stationary
  hospitals of all armies.

  The innovation which is most striking, in reading these documents,
  is the pre-existence of the committees for war, and their creation
  and maintenance in times of peace.

  If those societies which have hitherto labored had only conformed to
  this arrangement, they would have been spared much trouble, and
  would have been able to give to their resources a more judicious
  direction. If each of them had been enlightened by the experience
  of its predecessors; if each had known before hand that which it
  would have to do in such and such an emergency; if it had
  anticipated obstacles in order to remove them; and if it had been
  provided with money and material, it would have been able to render
  much greater services, and would not, to the same extent, have been
  a victim either to its inexperience or to its precipitation. The
  preliminary study of ways and means would have left traces of
  something more systematic and would have prevented much waste and
  many false calculations. Voluntary action will be so much more
  efficacious when it shall have preorganized. At a meeting of the
  different German relief committees held at Berlin, on the tenth of
  July, 1864, Baron Tinti, of Vienna, strongly insisted on this truth,
  and the Committee of Schwerin did the same in its report of 1865.
  When our generosity shall be less ignorant, it will know where and
  in what way it can be useful; we shall economize our means; we shall
  multiply our gifts by the good employment that we shall make of
  them, and by the direction that will be given to the public desire.
  _Bis dat, qui cito dat._ He who gives opportunely gives twice.

THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TREATY.


CONVENTION OF GENEVA.

  _For the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies at the
                        Field, August 22, 1864._

  The sovereigns of the following countries, to wit: Baden, Belgium,
  Denmark, Holland, Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Saxony,
  WÃ¼rtemberg, and the Federal Council of Switzerland, animated by a
  common desire of mitigating, as far as in their power, the evils
  inseparable from war, of suppressing needless severities and of
  ameliorating the condition of soldiers wounded on fields of battle,
  having concluded to determine a treaty for this purpose, these
  plenipotentiaries, after the due interchange of their powers, found
  to be in good and proper form, have agreed upon the following
  articles, to wit:

  ARTICLE 1. Ambulances (field hospitals) and military hospitals shall
  be acknowledged to be neutral, and as such shall be protected and
  respected by belligerents, so long as any sick or wounded may be
  therein. Such neutrality shall cease, if the ambulances or hospitals
  should be held by a military force.

  ART. 2. Persons employed in hospitals and ambulances, comprising the
  staff for superintendence, medical service, administration,
  transport of wounded, as well as chaplains, shall participate in the
  benefit of neutrality whilst so employed, and so long as there
  remain any to bring in or to succor.

  ART. 3. The persons designated in the preceding article may, even
  after occupation by the enemy, continue to fulfill their duties in
  the hospital or ambulance which they may have, or may withdraw in
  order to regain the corps to which they belong. Under such
  circumstances, when the persons shall cease from their functions,
  they shall be delivered by the occupying army to the outposts of the
  enemy. They shall have specially the right of sending a
  representative to the headquarters of their respective armies.

  ART. 4. As the equipment of military hospitals remains subject to
  the laws of war, persons attached to such hospitals cannot, on
  withdrawing, carry away any articles but such as are their private
  property. Under the same circumstances an ambulance shall, on the
  contrary, retain its equipment.

  ART. 5. Inhabitants of the country who may bring help to the wounded
  shall be respected and shall remain free. The generals of the
  belligerent powers shall make it their care to inform the
  inhabitants of the appeal addressed to their humanity, and of the
  neutrality which will be the consequence of it. Any wounded man
  entertained and taken care of in a house shall be considered as a
  protection thereto. Any inhabitant who shall have entertained
  wounded men in his house shall be exempted from the quartering of
  troops, as well as from a part of the contributions of war which may
  be imposed.

  ART. 6. Wounded or sick soldiers shall be entertained and taken care
  of, to whatever nation they may belong. Commanders-in-chief shall
  have the power to deliver immediately to the outposts of the enemy,
  soldiers who have been wounded in an engagement, when circumstances
  permit this to be done, and with the consent of both parties. Those
  who are recognized after they are healed as incapable of serving,
  shall be sent back to their country. The others may also be sent
  back on the condition of not again bearing arms during the
  continuance of the war. Evacuations, together with the persons under
  whose directions they take place, shall be protected by an absolute
  neutrality.

  ART. 7. A distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for
  hospitals, ambulances, and evacuations. It must on every occasion be
  accompanied by the national flag. An arm badge (brassard) shall also
  be allowed for individuals neutralized, but the delivery thereof
  shall be left to military authority. The flag and arm badge shall
  bear a red cross on a white ground.

  ART. 8. The details of execution of the present convention shall be
  regulated by the commanders-in-chief of belligerent armies,
  according to the instructions of their respective governments, and
  in conformity with the general principles laid down in this
  convention.

  ART. 9. The high contracting powers have agreed to communicate the
  present convention to those governments which have not found it
  convenient to send plenipotentiaries to the International Convention
  at Geneva, with an invitation to accede thereto; the protocol is,
  for that purpose, left open.

  ART. 10. The present convention shall be ratified and the
  ratification shall be exchanged at Berne, in four months, or sooner,
  if possible.

  In witness thereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the
  same, and have affixed thereto the seal of their arms.

  Done at Geneva, the twenty-third day of August, 1864.

The following public address, written in 1881, is inserted because of
its historical character, showing as it does, quite as well as anything
that could now be written, the general apathy in America concerning the
treaty, and the many obstacles that had to be overcome by years of
struggle and weary waiting:


ADDRESS BY CLARA BARTON.

_To the President, Congress, and People of the United States:_

A brief statement of how I became acquainted with the Red Cross may
serve to explain at once its principles and methods, as well as the
present attitude of our government in regard to it.

The practical beneficence of the sanitary and Christian commissions of
the United States attracted the attention of the civilized world. I had
borne some part in the operations of field hospitals in actual service
in the battles of the Civil War, and some public notice had been taken
of that work. But, broken in health, I was directed by my physicians to
go to Europe prepared to remain three years.

In September, 1869, I arrived at Geneva, Switzerland. In October I was
visited by the president and members of the "International Committee for
the relief of the wounded in war." They wished to learn if possible why
the United States had declined to sign the treaty. Our position was
incomprehensible to them. If the treaty had originated with a monarchial
government they could see some ground for hesitancy. But it originated
in a Republic older than our own. To what did America object, and how
could these objections be overcome? They had twice formally presented it
to the government at Washington, once in 1864, through our Minister
Plenipotentiary at Berne, who was present at the convention; again in
1868, through Rev. Dr. Henry W. Bellows, the great head of war relief in
America. They had failed in both instances. No satisfactory nor adequate
reason had ever been given by the nation for the course pursued. They
had thought the people of America, with their grand sanitary record,
would be the first to appreciate and accept it. I listened in silent
wonder to all this recital, and when I did reply it was to say that I
had never in America heard of the Convention of Geneva nor of the
treaty, and was sure that as a country America did not know she had
declined; that she would be the last to withhold recognition of a humane
movement; that it had doubtless been referred to and declined by some
one department of the government, or some one official, and had never
been submitted to the people; and as its literature was in languages
foreign to our English-speaking population, it had no way of reaching
us.

You will naturally infer that I examined it. I became all the time more
deeply impressed with the wisdom of its principles, the good practical
sense of its details, and its extreme usefulness in practice. Humane
intelligence had devised its provisions and peculiarly adapted it to win
popular favor. The absurdity of our own position in relation to it was
simply marvelous. As I counted up its roll of twenty-two nations--not a
civilized people in the world but ourselves missing, and saw Greece,
Spain, and Turkey there, I began to fear that in the eyes of the "rest
of mankind" we could not be far from barbarians. This reflection did not
furnish a stimulating food for national pride. I grew more and more
ashamed. But the winter wore on as winters do with invalids abroad. The
summer found me at Berne in quest of strength among its mountain views
and baths.

On the fifteenth of July, 1870, France declared war against Prussia.
Within three days a band of agents from the "International Committee of
Geneva," headed by Dr. Louis Appia (one of the prime movers of the
convention), equipped for work and _en route_ for the seat of war, stood
at the door of my villa inviting me to go with them and take such part
as I had taken in our own war. I had not strength to trust for that, and
declined with thanks, promising to follow in my own time and way, and I
did follow within a week. No shot had then been fired--no man had
fallen--yet this organized, powerful commission was on its way, with its
skilled agents, ready to receive, direct and dispense the charities and
accumulations which the generous sympathies of twenty-two nations, if
applied to, might place at its disposal. These men had treaty power to
go directly on to any field, and work unmolested in full co-operation
with the military and commanders-in-chief; their supplies held sacred
and their efforts recognized and seconded in every direction by either
belligerent army. Not a man could lie uncared for nor unfed. I thought
of the Peninsula in McClellan's campaign--of Pittsburg Landing, Cedar
Mountain and second Bull Run, Antietam, Old Fredericksburg with its
acres of snow-covered and gun-covered _glacee_, and its fourth-day flag
of truce; of its dead, and starving wounded, frozen to the ground, and
our commissions and their supplies in Washington, with no effective
organization to go beyond; of the Petersburg mine, with its four
thousand dead and wounded and no flag of truce, the wounded broiling in
a July sun--died and rotted where they fell. I remembered our prisons,
crowded with starving men whom all the powers and pities of the world
could not reach even with a bit of bread. I thought of the widows' weeds
still fresh and dark through all the land, north and south, from the
pine to the palm; the shadows on the hearths and hearts over all my
country. Sore, broken hearts, ruined, desolate homes! Was this people to
decline a humanity in war? Was this a country to reject a treaty for the
help of wounded soldiers? Were these the women and men to stand aloof
and consider? I believed if these people knew that the last cloud of war
had forever passed from their horizon, the tender, painful, deathless
memories of what had been would bring them in with a force no power
could resist. They needed only to know.

As I journeyed on and saw the work of these Red Cross societies in the
field, accomplishing in four months under their systematic organization
what we failed to accomplish in four years without it--no mistakes, no
needless suffering, no starving, no lack of care, no waste, no
confusion, but order, plenty, cleanliness and comfort wherever that
little flag made its way--a whole continent marshaled under the banner
of the Red Cross--as I saw all this, and joined and worked in it, you
will not wonder that I said to myself "If I live to return to my country
I will try to make my people understand the Red Cross and that treaty."
But I did more than resolve, I promised other nations I would do it, and
other reasons pressed me to remember my promise. The Franco-Prussian war
and the war of the commune were both enormous in the extent of their
operations and in the suffering of individuals. This great modern
international impulse of charity went out everywhere to meet and
alleviate its miseries. The small, poor countries gave of their poverty
and the rich nations poured out abundantly of their vast resources. The
contributions of those under the Red Cross went quietly, promptly
through international responsible channels, were thoughtfully and
carefully distributed through well-known agents, returns, accurate to a
franc, were made and duly published to the credit of the contributing
nations, and _the object aimed at was accomplished_.

America, filled with German and French people, with people humane and
universal in their instincts of citizenship and brotherhood, freighted
ships with supplies and contributions in money prodigal and vast. They
arrived in Europe, but they were not under the treaty regulations. No
sign of the Red Cross authorized any one to receive and distribute them.
The poor baffled agents, honest, well meaning and indefatigable, did all
that individuals without system or organization could do. But for the
most part the magnificent charity of America was misapplied and went as
unsystematized charity always tends to go, to ruin and to utter waste.
_The object aimed at was not accomplished._

At the end of the report of the international organization of the Red
Cross occurs something like this: "It is said that the United States of
America also contributed something for the sick and wounded, but what,
or how much, or to whom, or when or where, it is impossible to tell."

In the autumn of 1873, I returned to America more broken in health than
when I left in 1869. Then followed years of suffering in which I forgot
how to walk, but I remembered my resolve and my promise. After almost
five years I was able to go to Washington with a letter from Monsieur
Moynier, president of the International Committee of Geneva, to the
President of the United States, asking once more that our government
accede to the articles of the convention. Having been made the official
bearer of this letter, I presented it in 1877 to President Hayes, who
received it kindly, referring it to his Secretary of State, Mr. Evarts,
who in his turn referred it to his assistant secretary as the person who
would know all about it, examine and report for decision. I then saw how
it was made to depend not alone upon one department, but one man, who
had been the assistant secretary of state in 1864 and also in 1868, when
the treaty had been on the two previous occasions presented to our
government. It was a settled thing. There was nothing to hope for from
that administration. The matter had been officially referred and would
be decided accordingly. It would be declined because it had been
declined. If I pressed it to a decision, it would only weigh it down
with a third refusal. I waited. My next thought was to refer it to
Congress. That step would be irregular, and discourteous to the
administration. I did not like to take it, still I attempted it, but
could not get it considered, for it promised neither political
influence, patronage, nor votes.

The next year I returned to Washington to try Congress again. I
published a little pamphlet of two leaves addressed to the members and
senators, to be laid upon their desks in the hope they would take the
trouble to read so little as that, and be by so much the better prepared
to consider and act upon a bill if I could get one before them. My
strength failed before I could get that bill presented, and I went home
again in midwinter. There then remained but a portion of the term of
that administration, and I determined, if possible, to outlive it,
hoping another would be more responsive. Meanwhile I wrote, talked, and
did whatever I could to spread the idea among the people, and March,
1881, when the administration of President Garfield came in, I went
again to Washington. The subject was very cordially received by the
President and carefully referred by him to Secretary Blaine, who
considered it himself, conferred fully with me, and finally laid it
before the President and the cabinet. Perhaps the most satisfactory
account of that transaction will be found in the letter of Mr. Blaine
addressed to me, (see page 41), which gives the assurance that President
Garfield would recommend the adoption of the treaty in his message to
Congress.

What were the provisions of that treaty which had been so conspicuously
and persistently neglected and apparently rejected by this whole
government, whose people are as humane as any people in the world, and
as ready to adopt plain and common sense provisions against evils sure
to come upon themselves and those whom they hold most dear? It was
merely the proposed adoption of a treaty by this government with other
nations for the purpose of ameliorating the conditions incident to
warfare, humanizing its regulations, softening its barbarities, and so
far as possible, lessening the sufferings of the wounded and sick who
fall by it. This treaty consists of a code of ten articles, formed and
adopted by the International Convention of Geneva, Switzerland, held
August 22, 1864, which convention was composed of delegates, two or more
from each of the civilized nations of the world, and was called at the
instance of the members of the Society of Public Utility of Switzerland.

The sittings of the convention occupied four days, and resulted, as
before stated, in a code of ten articles, to be taken by the delegates
there present, back to the governments of their respective countries for
ratification. Four months were allowed for consideration and decision by
the governments, and all acceding within that time were held as having
signed at the convention. At the close of this period, it was found that
twelve nations had endorsed the terms of the treaty and signed its
articles. The protocol was left open for such as should follow. The
articles of this treaty provide, as its first and most important
feature, for the entire and strict neutrality of all material and
supplies contributed by any nation for the use of the sick and wounded
in war; also that persons engaged in the distribution of them, shall
not be subject to capture; that all hospitals, general or field, shall
be neutral, respected and protected by all belligerents; that all
persons comprising the medical service, surgeons, chaplains,
superintendents, shall be neutral, continuing their work after the
occupation of a field or post the same as before, and when no longer
needed be free to retire; that they may send a representative to their
own headquarters if needful; that field hospitals shall retain their own
equipments; that inhabitants of a country who entertain and care for the
wounded of either side, in their houses, shall be protected; that the
generals of an army shall so inform the people; that commanders-in-chief
shall have the power to deliver immediately to the outposts of the enemy
soldiers who have been wounded in an engagement, both parties consenting
to the same; that the wounded, incapable of serving, shall be returned
when healed; that all transports of wounded and all evacuations of posts
or towns shall be protected by absolute neutrality. That the sick and
wounded shall be entertained regardless of nationality; and that
commanders-in-chief shall act in accordance with the instructions of
their respective governments, and in conformity to the treaty. In order
that all may understand, and no mistake be possible, it also provides
that one uniform international flag shall mark all hospitals, all posts
of sick and wounded, and one uniform badge or sign shall mark all
hospital material, and be worn by all persons properly engaged in the
hospital service of any nation included within the treaty; that this
international flag and sign shall be a red cross on a white ground, and
that the nations within the compact shall not cease their endeavors
until every other nation capable of making war shall have signed this
treaty, and thus acceded to the general principles of humanity in
warfare recognized by other peoples.

Thirty-one governments have already signed this treaty, thirty-one
nations are in this humane compact. The United States of America is not
in it, and the work to which your attention is called, and which has
occupied me for the last several years, is to induce her to place
herself there.

This is what the Red Cross means, not an order of knighthood, not a
commandery, not a secret society, not a society at all by itself, but
the powerful, peaceful sign and the reducing to practical usefulness of
one of the broadest and most needed humanities the world has ever known.

These articles, it will be observed, constitute at once a treaty
governing our relations with foreign nations, and additional articles of
war governing the conduct of our military forces in the field. As a
treaty under the constitution, the President and Senate are competent to
deal with them; as additional articles of war, Congress must sanction
and adopt them before they can become effective and binding upon the
government and the people. For this reason I have appealed to Congress
as well as to the Executive Department.

On the breaking up of the original convention at Geneva, the practical
work of organizing its principles into form and making them understood
and adopted by the people, devolved upon seven men, mainly those who had
been instrumental in calling it. These men were peculiarly fitted for
this work by special training, enlarged views, and a comprehensive
charity, no less than by practical insight, knowledge of the facts and
needs of the situation, and a brave trust in the humane instincts of
human nature. They are known to-day the world over as "The International
Committee of Geneva for the relief of the sick and wounded in war." This
committee is international, and is the one medium through which all
nations within the treaty transact business and carry on correspondence.

The first act of each nation subsequent to the treaty has been to
establish a central society of its own, which of course is national, and
which has general charge and direction of the work of its own country.
Under these comes the establishment of local societies. It will be
perceived that their system, aside from its international feature, is
very nearly what our own war relief societies would have been had they
retained permanent organizations. Indeed, it is believed that we
furnished for their admirable system some very valuable ideas. The
success of the Red Cross associations consists in their making their
societies permanent, holding their organizations firm and intact,
guarding their supplies, saving their property from waste, destruction
and pillage, and making the persons in charge of the gifts of the people
as strictly responsible for straightforward conduct and honest returns,
as they would be for the personal property of an individual, a business
firm, or a bank.

In attempting to present to the people of this country the plan of the
Red Cross societies, it is proper to explain that originally and as
operating in other countries they recognize only the miseries arising
from war. Their humanities, although immense, are confined to this war
centre. The treaty does not cover more than this, but the resolutions
for the establishment of societies under the treaty, permit them to
organize in accordance with the spirit and needs of their nationalities.
By our geographical position and isolation we are far less liable to
the disturbances of war than the nations of Europe, which are so
frequently called upon that they do well to keep in readiness for the
exigencies of war alone. But no country is more liable than our own to
great overmastering calamities, various, widespread and terrible. Seldom
a year passes that the nation from sea to sea is not, by the shock of
some sudden, unforeseen disaster, brought to utter consternation, and
stands shivering like a ship in a gale, powerless, horrified, and
despairing. Plagues, cholera, fires, flood, famine, all bear upon us
with terrible force. Like war these events are entirely out of the
common course of woes and necessities. Like death they are sure to come
in some form and at some time, and like it no mortal knows where, how or
when.

What have we in readiness to meet these emergencies save the good heart
of our people and their impulsive, generous gifts? Certainly no
organized system for collection, reception nor distribution; no agents,
nurses nor material, and, worst of all, no funds; nowhere any resources
in _reserve_ for use in such an hour of peril and national woe; every
movement crude, confused and unsystematized, every thing as unprepared
as if we had never known a calamity before and had no reason to expect
one again.

Meanwhile the suffering victims wait! True, in the shock we bestow most
generously, lavishly even. Men "on Change" plunge their hands into their
pockets and throw their gold to strangers, who may have neither
preparation nor fitness for the work they undertake, and often no
guaranty for honesty. Women, in the terror and excitement of the moment
and in their eagerness to aid, beg in the streets and rush into fairs,
working day and night, to the neglect of other duties in the present,
and at the peril of all health in the future--often an enormous outlay
for very meagre returns. Thus our gifts fall far short of their best,
being hastily bestowed, irresponsibly received and wastefully applied.
We should not, even if to some degree we might, depend upon our ordinary
charitable and church societies to meet these great catastrophes; they
are always overtaxed. Our communities abound in charitable societies,
but each has its specific object to which its resources are and must be
applied; consequently they cannot be relied upon for prompt and abundant
aid in a great and sudden emergency. This must necessarily be the case
with all societies which organize to work for a specific charity. And
this is as it should be; it is enough that they do constantly bestow.

Charity bears an open palm, to give is her mission. But I have never
classed these Red Cross societies with charities, I have rather
considered them as a wise national provision which seeks to garner and
store up something against an hour of sudden need. In all our land we
have not one organization of this nature and which acts upon the system
of conserved resources. Our people have been more wise and thoughtful in
the establishment of means for preventing and arresting the destruction
of property than the destruction of human life and the lessening of
consequent suffering. They have provided and maintain at an immense
cost, in the aggregate, a system of fire departments with their
expensive buildings and apparatus, with their fine horses and strong men
kept constantly in readiness to dash to the rescue at the first dread
clang of the fire bell. Still, while the electric current may flash upon
us at any moment its ill tidings of some great human distress, we have
no means of relief in readiness such as these Red Cross societies would
furnish.

I beg you will not feel that in the presentation of this plan of action
I seek to add to the labors of the people. On the contrary, I am
striving to lessen them by making previous, calm preparation do away
with the strain and confusion of unexpected necessities and haste. I am
providing not weariness, but rest.

And, again, I would not be understood as suggesting the raising of more
moneys for charitable purposes; rather I am trying to save the people's
means, to economize their charities, to make their gifts do more by the
prevention of needless waste and extravagance. If I thought that the
formation of these societies would add a burden to our people I would be
the last to advocate it. I would not, however, yield the fact of the
treaty. For patriotism, for national honor, I would stand by that at all
cost. My first and greatest endeavor has been to wipe from the scroll of
my country's fame the stain of imputed lack of common humanity, to take
her out of the roll of barbarism. I said that in 1869 there were
twenty-two nations in the compact. There are now thirty-one, for since
that date have been added Roumania, Persia, San Salvador, Montenegro,
Servia, Bolivia, Chili, Argentine Republic and Peru. If the United
States of America is fortunate and diligent she may, perhaps, come to
stand No. 32 in the roll of civilization and humanity. If not, she will
remain where she at present stands, among the barbarians and the
heathen.

In considering this condition of things it seemed desirable to so extend
the original design of the Red Cross societies operating in other lands
as to include not only suffering by war, but by pestilence, famine,
fires or floods--in short, any unlooked-for calamity so great as to
place it beyond the means of ordinary local charity, and which by
public opinion would be pronounced a national calamity; but that this
addition should in no way impair the original functions of the society,
and that for their own well being they should be held firm by the
distinguishing feature of the international constitution, which provides
that local societies shall not act except upon orders from the National
Association, which is charged with the duty of being so fully informed
upon all such subjects, both at home and abroad, as to constitute it the
most competent judge of the magnitude and gravity of any catastrophe.

During all these years no societies under the true banner of the Red
Cross of Geneva were or could be organized, for the government had not
yet ratified the treaty and no department of the government had then
intimated that it ever would be ratified. It could not be a responsible
or quite an honest movement on my part to proceed to the formation of
societies to act under and in conformity to a treaty of special
character so long as our government recognized no such treaty and I
could get no assurance that it ever would or indeed could recognize it.

But this delay in the formation of societies, however embarrassing, was
in no manner able to interfere with the general plan, or the working
details for its operations, which had been arranged and decided upon
before the presentation of the subject to the government in 1877, and
published in pamphlet form in 1878, making it to cover, as it now does,
the entire field of national relief for great national woes and
calamities in time of peace, no less than in war. The wise provisions,
careful preparations and thorough system which had been found so
efficient in the permanent societies of the Red Cross in other
countries, could not fail, I thought, to constitute both a useful and
powerful system of relief in any class of disasters. I therefore
ventured so far upon the generous spirit of their original resolutions
in the plan of our societies as, mechanically speaking, to attach to
this vast motor power the extra and hitherto dead weight of our great
national calamities, in order that the same force should apply to all
and serve to lighten I hoped, so far as possible, not only the woes of
those directly called to suffer, but the burdens on the hearts and hands
of those called to sympathize with their sufferings.

The time allowed for the practical test of this experiment has been
short. Scarcely three months in which to organize and act, but the brave
societies of the Red Cross of western New York, at this moment standing
so nobly among their flame-stricken neighbors of Michigan--so
generously responding to their calls for help, are quite sufficient I
believe to show what the action and results of this combined system will
be when recognized and inaugurated.

It may be said that this treaty jeopardizes our traditional policy,
which jealously guards against entangling alliances abroad; that as we
are exempt by our geographical position from occasions for war this
treaty must bring us not benefits but only burdens from other people's
calamities and wars--calamities and wars which we do not create and of
which we may properly reap the incidental advantages. But this treaty
binds none to bear burdens, but only to refrain from cruelties; it binds
not to give but to allow others to give wisely and to work humanely if
they will, while all shall guarantee to them undisturbed activity in
deeds of charity. There is then in the Red Cross no "entangling
alliance" that any but a barbarian at war can feel as a restraint. This
inculcated wariness of foreign influences, wonderfully freshened by the
conduct of foreign rulers and writers during the rebellion and deepened
by the crimes and the craft directed primarily at Mexico and ultimately
at us, made the people of America in 1864 and 1868 devoutly thankful for
the friendly and stormy sea that rolled between them and the European
states. And it is not perhaps altogether strange that American
statesmen, inspired by such a public opinion, should then have been but
little inclined to look with favor upon any new international
obligations however specious in appearance or humane in fact. But the
award of Geneva surely opened the way for the Red Cross of Geneva. Time
and success have made plain the nation's path. The postal treaty since
made among all nations and entered into heartily by this has proved
salutary to all. It has removed every valid state reason for opposition
to the harmless, humane and peaceful provisions of the treaty of the Red
Cross.

But in the midst of the rugged facts of war come sentimental objections
and objectors. For, deplore it as we may, war _is the great fact_ of all
history and its most pitiable feature is not after all so much the great
numbers slain, wounded and captured in battle, as their cruel after
treatment as wounded and prisoners, no adequate provision being made for
their necessities, no humane care even permitted, except at the risk of
death or imprisonment as spies, of those moved by wise pity or a simple
religious zeal.

Among these hard facts appears a conscientious theorist and asks, Is not
war a great sin and wrong? Ought we to provide for it, to make it easy,
to lessen its horrors, to mitigate its sufferings? Shall we not in this
way encourage rulers and peoples to engage in war for slight and fancied
grievances?

We provide for the victims of the great wrong and sin of intemperance.
These are for the most part voluntary victims, each in a measure the
arbiter of his own fate. The soldier has generally no part, no voice, in
creating the war in which he fights. He simply obeys as he must his
superiors and the laws of his country. Yes, it is a great wrong and sin,
and for that reason I would provide not only for, but against it.

But here comes the speculative theorist! Isn't it encouraging a bad
principle; wouldn't it be better to do away with all war? Wouldn't peace
societies be better? Oh, yes, my friend, as much better as the
millennium would be better than this, but it is not here. Hard facts are
here; war is here; war is the outgrowth, indicator and relic of
barbarism. Civilization alone will do away with it, and scarcely a
quarter of the earth is yet civilized, and that quarter not beyond the
possibilities of war. It is a long step yet to permanent peace. We
cannot cross a stream until we reach it. The sober truth is, we are
called to deal with facts, not theories; we must practice if we would
teach. And be assured, my friends, there is not a peace society on the
face of the earth to-day, nor ever will be, so potent, so effectual
against war as the Red Cross of Geneva.

The sooner the world learns that the halo of glory which surrounds a
field of battle and its tortured, thirsting, starving, pain-racked,
dying victims exists only in imagination; that it is all sentiment,
delusion, falsehood, given for effect; that soldiers do not die painless
deaths; that the sum of all human agony finds its equivalent on the
battlefield, in the hospital, by the weary wayside and in the prison;
that, deck it as you will, it is agony; the sooner and more thoroughly
the people of the earth are brought to realize and appreciate these
facts, the more slow and considerate they will be about rushing into
hasty and needless wars, and the less popular war will become.

Death by the bullet painless! What did this nation do during eighty
agonizing and memorable days but to watch the effects of one bullet
wound? Was it painless? Painless either to the victim or the nation?
Though canopied by a fortitude, patience, faith and courage scarce
exceeded in the annals of history, still was it agony. And when in his
delirious dreams the dying President murmured, "The great heart of the
nation will not let the soldier die," I prayed God to hasten the time
when every wounded soldier would be sustained by this sweet assurance;
that in the combined sympathies, wisdom, enlightenment and power of the
nations, he should indeed feel that the great heart of the people would
not let the soldier die.

Friends, was it accident, or was it providence which made it one of the
last acts of James A. Garfield in health to pledge himself to urge upon
the representatives of his people in Congress assembled, this great
national step for the relief and care of wounded men? Living or dying it
was his act and his wish, and no member in that honored, considerate and
humane body but will feel himself in some manner holden to see it
carried out.


ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

The president of the American Red Cross, Clara Barton, in November,
1881, laid before President Arthur the matter of the Treaty of Geneva,
and the unfulfilled desire of President Garfield that the United States
should give its adhesion to that international compact. To this
President Arthur gave a cordial and favorable response, and made good
his words by the following paragraph in his first annual message, sent
to the forty-seventh Congress:

  At its last extra session the Senate called for the text of the
  Geneva Convention for the relief of the wounded in war. I trust that
  this action foreshadows such interest in the subject as will result
  in the adhesion of the United States to that humane and commendable
  engagement.

This part of the message was immediately taken up in the Senate and
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, consisting of the
following named gentlemen, to wit: William Windom, Minnesota; George F.
Edmunds, Vermont; John T. Miller, California; Thomas W. Ferry, Michigan;
Elbridge G. Lapham, New York; John W. Johnston, Virginia; J.T. Morgan,
Alabama; George H. Pendleton, Ohio; Benjamin H. Hill, Georgia.

During the consideration of the subject an invitation was extended to
the president of the American Association, its counsel and other
associate members to meet the above named Senate Committee at the
capitol, for conference, and for an explanation of such points as still
remained obscure, to aid their deliberations, and to facilitate
investigations.

On the seventeenth of May, 1881, Hon. Omar D. Conger submitted to the
United States Senate the following resolution, which was considered by
unanimous consent and agreed to:

  _Resolved_, That the Secretary of State be requested to furnish to
  the Senate copies (translations) of Articles of Convention signed at
  Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of
  those wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification
  employed by the several governments, parties thereto.

On the twelfth of December, 1881, in response to the above resolution,
President Arthur addressed to the Senate a message transmitting a report
of the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, touching the Geneva
convention for the relief of the wounded in war, which message, report
and accompanying papers were as follows:

          (Senate Ex. Doc. No. 6, 47th Congress, 1st Session.)

  Message from the President of the United States, transmitting in
  response to Senate resolution of May 17th, 1881, a report of the
  Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, touching the Geneva
  convention for the relief of the wounded in war.

  December 12, 1881.--Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and
  ordered to be printed.

_To Senate of the United States:_

I transmit herewith, in response to the resolution of the Senate of the
seventeenth of May last, a report of the Secretary of State, with
accompanying papers, touching the Geneva convention for the relief of
the wounded in war.

                                                CHESTER A. ARTHUR,

           EXECUTIVE MANSION,
  WASHINGTON, _December 12, 1881_.


_To the President:_

The Secretary of State, to whom was addressed a resolution of the
Senate, dated the seventeenth of May, 1881, requesting him "to furnish
to the Senate copies (translations) of Articles of Convention signed at
Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of those
wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification employed by the
several governments, parties thereto," has the honor to lay before the
President the papers called for by the resolution.

In view of the reference made, in the annual message of the President,
to the Geneva convention, the Secretary of State deems it unnecessary
now to enlarge upon the advisability of the adhesion of the United
States to an international compact at once so humane in its character
and so universal in its application as to commend itself to the adoption
of nearly all the civilized powers.

          DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
  WASHINGTON, _December 10, 1881_.


THE "ADDITIONAL ARTICLES" CONCERNING THE RED CROSS FOR THE NAVY.

The governments of North Germany, Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and WÃ¼rtemberg, desiring to extend to armies
on the sea the advantages of the convention concluded at Geneva the
twenty-second of August, 1864, for the amelioration of the condition of
wounded soldiers in armies in the field, and to further particularize
some of the stipulations of the said convention, proposed and signed the
following additional articles:

Additional Articles to the Convention of Geneva of the twenty-second
August, 1864, signed at Geneva the twentieth of October, 1868.

  ARTICLE I. The persons designated in Article II. of the convention
  shall, after the occupation by the enemy, continue to fulfill their
  duties, according to their wants, to the sick and wounded in the
  ambulance or the hospital which they serve. When they request to
  withdraw, the commander of the occupying troops shall fix the time
  of departure, which he shall only be allowed to delay for a short
  time in case of military necessity.

  ART. II. Arrangements will have to be made by the belligerent powers
  to ensure to the neutralized person, fallen into the hands of the
  army of the enemy, the entire enjoyment of his salary.

  ART. III. Under the conditions provided for in Articles I. and IV.
  of the convention, the name "ambulance" applies to field hospitals
  and other temporary establishments, which follow the troops on the
  field of battle to receive the sick and wounded.

  ART. IV. In conformity with the spirit of Article V. of the
  convention, and to the reservations contained in the protocol of
  1864, it is explained that for the appointment of the charges
  relative to the quartering of troops and of the contributions of
  war, account only shall be taken in an equitable manner of the
  charitable zeal displayed by the inhabitants.

  ART. V. In addition to Article VI. of the convention, it is
  stipulated that, with the reservation of officers whose detention
  might be important to the fate of arms, and within the limits fixed
  by the second paragraph of that article, the wounded fallen into the
  hands of the enemy shall be sent back to their country, after they
  are cured, or sooner if possible, on condition, nevertheless, of not
  again bearing arms during the continuance of the war.

  ART. VI. The boats which, at their own risk and peril, during and
  after an engagement pick up the shipwrecked or wounded, or which,
  having picked them up, convey them on board a neutral, or hospital
  ship, shall enjoy, until the accomplishment of their mission, the
  character of neutrality, as far as the circumstances of the
  engagement and the position of the ships engaged will permit.

  The appreciation of these circumstances is entrusted to the humanity
  of all the combatants. The wrecked and wounded thus picked up and
  saved must not serve again during the continuance of the war.

  ART. VII. The religious, medical and hospital staff of any captured
  vessel are declared neutral, and, on leaving the ship, may remove
  the articles and surgical instruments which are their private
  property.

  ART. VIII. The staff designated in the preceding article must
  continue to fulfill their functions in the captured ship, assisting
  in the removal of wounded made by the victorious party; they will
  then be at liberty to return to their country, in conformity with
  the second paragraph of the first additional article.

  The stipulations of the second additional article are applicable to
  the pay and allowance of the staff.

  ART. IX. The military hospital ships remain under martial law in all
  that concerns their stores; they become the property of the captor,
  but the latter must not divert them from their special appropriation
  during the continuance of the war.

  The vessels not equipped for fighting, which during peace the
  government shall have officially declared to be intended to serve as
  floating hospital ships, shall, however, enjoy during the war
  complete neutrality, both as regards stores, and also as regards
  their staff, provided their equipment is exclusively appropriated to
  the special service on which they are employed.

  ART. X. Any merchantman, to whatever nation she may belong, charged
  exclusively with removal of sick and wounded, is protected by
  neutrality, but the mere fact, noted on the ship's books, of the
  vessel having been visited by an enemy's cruiser, renders the sick
  and wounded incapable of serving during the continuance of the war.
  The cruiser shall even have the right of putting on board an officer
  in order to accompany the convoy, and thus verify the good faith of
  the operation.

  If the merchant ship also carries a cargo, her neutrality will still
  protect it, provided that such cargo is not of a nature to be
  confiscated by the belligerents.

  The belligerents retain the right to interdict neutralized vessels
  from all communication, and from any course which they may deem
  prejudicial to the secrecy of their operations. In urgent cases,
  special conventions may be entered into between commanders-in-chief,
  in order to neutralize temporarily and in a special manner the
  vessels intended for the removal of the sick and wounded.

  ART. XI. Wounded or sick sailors and soldiers, when embarked, to
  whatever nation they may belong, shall be protected and taken care
  of by their captors.

  Their return to their own country is subject to the provisions of
  Article VI. of the convention, and of the additional Article V.

  ART. XII. The distinctive flag to be used with the national flag, in
  order to indicate any vessel or boat which may claim the benefits of
  neutrality, in virtue of the principles of this convention, is a
  white flag with a red cross. The belligerents may exercise in this
  respect any mode of verification which they may deem necessary.

  Military hospital ships shall be distinguished by being painted
  white outside, with green strake.

  ART. XIII. The hospital ships which are equipped at the expense of
  the aid societies, recognized by the governments signing this
  convention, and which are furnished with a commission emanating
  from the sovereign, who shall have given express authority for their
  being fitted out, and with a certificate from the proper naval
  authority that they have been placed under his control during their
  fitting out and on their final departure, and that they were then
  appropriated solely to the purpose of their mission, shall be
  considered neutral, as well as the whole of their staff. They shall
  be recognized and protected by the belligerents.

  They shall make themselves known by hoisting, together with their
  national flag, the white flag with a red cross. The distinctive mark
  of their staff, while performing their duties, shall be an armlet of
  the same colors.

  The outer painting of these hospital ships shall be white, with red
  strake.

  These ships shall bear aid and assistance to the wounded and wrecked
  belligerents, without distinction of nationality.

  They must take care not to interfere in any way with the movements
  of the combatants. During and after the battle they must do their
  duty at their own risk and peril.

  The belligerents shall have the right of controlling and visiting
  them; they will be at liberty to refuse their assistance, to order
  them to depart, and to detain them if the exigencies of the case
  require such a step.

  The wounded and wrecked picked up by these ships cannot be reclaimed
  by either of the combatants, and they will be required not to serve
  during the continuance of the war.

  ART. XIV. In naval wars any strong presumption that either
  belligerent takes advantage of the benefits of neutrality, with any
  other view than the interest of the sick and wounded, gives to the
  other belligerent, until proof to the contrary, the right of
  suspending the Convention Treaty, as regards such belligerent.

  Should this presumption become a certainty, notice may be given to
  such belligerent that the convention is suspended with regard to him
  during the whole continuance of the war.

  ART. XV. The present act shall be drawn up in a single original
  copy, which shall be deposited in the archives of the Swiss
  Confederation.

  An authentic copy of this act shall be delivered, with an invitation
  to adhere to it, to each of the signatory powers of the convention
  of the twenty-second of August, 1864, as well as to those that have
  successively acceded to it.

  In faith whereof, the undersigned commissaries have drawn up the
  present project of additional articles and have affixed thereunto
  the seals of their arms:

[_International Bulletin, January, 1882._]

THE GENEVA CONVENTION IN THE UNITED STATES.

The friends of the Red Cross are not ignorant that the list of States
which have signed the Geneva Convention presents a grave and lamentable
lack. One of the most civilized nations of the world, and consequently
one of the best prepared to subscribe to the principles of this treaty,
that is to say, the United States of America, does not appear there.
Their absence is so much the more surprising because the proceedings of
the Geneva Convention have only been, in some respects, the partial
reproduction of the celebrated "Instructions of the American Army,"
edited by the late Dr. Lieber, and adopted by President Lincoln (April
24, 1863), and put in practice by the armies of the North during the war
of secession. More than this, it is remembered that the Government at
Washington had been represented at the Diplomatic Conference of Geneva
in 1864 by two delegates at the debates relative to the Geneva
Convention, but without being furnished with sufficient power to sign
it. [Protocol of the session of August 9, 1864.] These were Messrs.
George J. Fogg, United States Minister at Berne, and Charles S.P.
Bowles, European Agent of the American Sanitary Commission.

It was expected, then, that the adhesion of the United States would soon
follow, but nothing came of it. Nevertheless, in the hope that this
result would not be too long delayed, an aid society was formed at New
York in 1866, when the civil war had come to an end, to gather in some
way the heritage of the Sanitary Commission, which had just filled with
much brilliancy, and during several years, the rÃ´le of a veritable Red
Cross Society.

One might have thought that the Berlin Conference in 1869 would be a
determining circumstance which would induce the United States to enter
into the European concert.

The invitation to assist at the Conference at Berlin in 1869 was
addressed to the Government of the United States, which declined it with
thanks, as not having taken part in the Convention of Geneva. The
society of which we have just spoken was in like manner invited, but it
also was not represented.

This double absence called out a proposition from M. Hepke, privy
counsellor of the legation, a proposition, supported by the signatures
of thirty-eight other delegates present, and adopted unanimously by the
members of the Conference.

The text of it was as follows:

"The Conference having arrived at the end of their labors, express a
lively regret at having been deprived of the precious assistance of the
delegates from the United States of North America, convinced that the
great and noble nation which, one of the first in the world, has
rendered eminent services to the great humanitarian work, will welcome
with sympathy the results of their labors, the Conference desires that
the protocols of these sessions shall be addressed by their President to
the Government of the United States of North America, and to the
different aid committees which exist in that country."

That step unfortunately remained without results. The society which had
its seat at New York, comprehending that its existence would be
unnatural and its position false so long as the government refused to
sign the convention, finished by dissolving towards the end of 1872.

Since then, the International Committee, which would not despair of
success, made upon its part several new attempts, which invariably met
with absolute non-attention. Happily the history of the Red Cross was
there to prove that the most tenacious resistance is not indefinite, and
that sooner or later the sentiments of the most recalcitrant governments
are modified under the control of circumstances. How many we have seen
who at first believed their adhesion useless, or even dangerous, and who
have been led to repentance on the occurrence of wars in which their
armies were to be, or had been, engaged, because they comprehended at
that moment only to what point their fears were chimerical or their
indifference injurious to those depending upon them for protection.

In the United States time has done its work as elsewhere, though peace
has long reigned there. The change of sentiment which has been produced
in regard to the Red Cross has revealed itself recently on the sixth of
December, 1881, in the message of President Arthur at the opening of the
fourth session of the Forty-seventh Congress. We read there the
following paragraph:

"At its last extra session the Senate demanded the text of the Geneva
Convention for aiding the wounded in time of war. I hope that this fact
proves the interest which the Senate feels in this question, and that
there will result from it, the adhesion of the United States to this
humane and commendable treaty."

It seems, then, that we touch the port; the matter is seriously
considered, and it will be with lively satisfaction that we shall
register the result which has been so long the end of our desires.

We will not terminate these retrospective considerations, without
telling what we know of the causes which have recently led to decisive
steps in the question.

It is, above all, to a woman that this result is owing, and the name of
that woman is not unknown to our readers. We spoke to them several years
ago of Miss Clara Barton, one of the heroines of the American war, where
she reproduced the charitable exploits of Miss Nightingale; she was
honored at the conclusion of the war with a national recompense.[A]

[A] This statement is not exact; indeed, it does some injustice as well
to Miss Barton as to the American Congress, and was doubtless derived
from misstatements promulgated in the United States, the result of a
general misunderstanding of the facts, and an error, of course, unknown
to a foreign writer.

Precisely what the Thirty-seventh Congress did was to pass the following
joint resolution of both houses, and in accordance with the same to pay
over to Miss Barton the sum mentioned in it for the uses and purposes
therein set forth:

                                                          March 10, 1866.

_A resolution providing for expenses incurred in searching for missing
soldiers of the Army of the United States, and for further prosecution
of the same._

_Whereas_, Miss Clara Barton has, during the late war of the rebellion,
expended from her own resources large sums of money in endeavoring to
discover missing soldiers of the armies of the United States, and in
communicating intelligence to their relatives; therefore,

_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled_, That the sum of fifteen
thousand dollars be, and the same is hereby appropriated out of any
moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to reimburse Miss
Clara Barton for the amount so expended by her, and to aid in the
further prosecution of the search for missing soldiers, and the printing
necessary to the furtherance of the said object shall hereafter be done
by the Public Printer.

Approved March 10, 1866.

[14 Vol. U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 350.]

This, therefore, was not recompense for services; it was reimbursement
for money expended; it was money expended by a private citizen for
public uses, and this, mainly, after the close of the war. The
government recognized its value to the people, and refunded the money,
and that without solicitation on Miss Barton's part.

This work was a fitting, even necessary, result of her four years'
voluntary and unpaid services on the field, not as an ordinary nurse,
but as a sort of independent sanitary commission, whom the government,
the soldiers, and the people came at last to implicitly trust, for they
never found their trust betrayed nor themselves disappointed by any want
of discretion, sagacity, or energy on her part. It cannot be set forth
here, it can only be alluded to most briefly. In its details it must
form a chapter in the story of a life singularly original, successful,
and beneficent.

--[Report of the American (National) Association of the Red Cross of
1883.]

Then, being in Europe at the time of the French and German war, she
again flew to the battlefield. Returning at last to her own country with
enfeebled health, she determined to give what strength remained to her
to the service of the Red Cross, and took for her task to plead its
cause with the influential men of the American government. Quitting her
home at Dansville, she passed long months at Washington to carry
conviction to the minds of the President, of his ministers, of members
of Congress, writing for the journals, publishing pamphlets to spread
the ideas the triumph of which she had at heart. She had need of much
perseverance and energy to avoid renouncing her plan, for she waited
long before finding a favorable opportunity. It was not until the
accession of President Garfield that she could catch a glimpse of
success. She then found in the Chief Magistrate of the nation a man who
warmly espoused her cause, and in the Secretary of State, Mr. Blaine, an
auxiliary as zealous as he was devoted. We have seen by the quotation
which we have borrowed from the last Presidential message that Mr.
Arthur shares the sentiments and ideas of his predecessor on the subject
of the Geneva Convention, and it is hardly probable that he will
encounter upon this point opposition from Congress.

The name of Miss Barton will probably not figure in the official
documents which will be the fruit of her labors, but here, where we have
entire liberty to render homage to her devotion, we are happy to be able
to proclaim her imperishable title to the gratitude of the Red Cross.

To the name of Miss Barton we should join that of M. Edouard Seve, who,
after having rendered important service to the Red Cross in South
America, where he represented Belgium to Chili, has continued to use his
activity in favor of the same cause in the United States since he has
been called to the position of consul-general at Philadelphia. His
efforts have certainly contributed to render the Government at
Washington favorable to the Geneva Convention.

The preceding article was already printed when we received from the
indefatigable Miss Barton a new pamphlet upon the Red Cross and the
Geneva Convention. This little work is destined to initiate the
Americans into the origin and history of the work, with which they are
as yet but imperfectly acquainted, and for which it is the aspiration of
the author to awaken their interest; in particular, we find there the
confirmation of the steps of which we have spoken above, and especially
the text of the two letters addressed by the International Committee,
one on the ninth of August, 1877, to President Hayes, the other on the
thirteenth of June, to Secretary of State Blaine.

The pamphlet which we have announced has been published by the American
National Society of the Red Cross, with which we have not yet had
occasion to make our readers acquainted. This society, recently
established at the suggestion of Miss Barton, and of which she has been
made president, is only waiting for the official adhesion of the United
States to the Geneva Convention to put itself in relation with the
societies of other countries. We will wait until then to speak of it and
to give the details of its organization.


ACCESSION OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE TREATY OF GENEVA AND TO THE ADDITIONAL
ARTICLES.

On the first day of March, 1882, the President, by his signature,
gave the accession of the United States to the Treaty of Geneva of August
22, 1864, and also to that of October 20, 1868, and transmitted to the
Senate the following message, declaration, and proposed adoption of
the same:

  _Message from the President of the United States, transmitting an
     accession of the United States to the Convention concluded at
     Geneva on the twenty-second August, 1864, between various powers,
     for the amelioration of the wounded of armies in the field, and
     to the additional articles thereto, signed at Geneva on the
     twentieth October, 1868._

  March 3, 1882.--Read; accession read the first time referred to the
  Committee on Foreign Relations, and, together with the message,
  ordered to be printed in confidence, for the use of the Senate.

  March 16, 1882.--Ratified and injunction of secrecy removed
  therefrom.

  _To the Senate of the United States:_

  I transmit to the Senate for its action thereon, the accession of
  the United States to the convention concluded at Geneva on the
  twenty-second August, 1864, between various powers, for the
  amelioration of the wounded of armies in the field, and to the
  additional articles thereto, signed at Geneva on the twentieth of
  October, 1868.

                                                CHESTER A. ARTHUR.
   WASHINGTON, _March 3, 1882_.

  _Whereas_, on the twenty-second day of August, 1864, a convention
  was concluded at Geneva, in Switzerland, between the Grand Duchy of
  Baden and the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Belgium, the
  Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Empire, the
  Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the
  Netherlands; the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Prussia, and
  the Kingdom of WÃ¼rtemberg, for the amelioration of the wounded in
  armies in the field, the tenor of which convention is as follows:

  (See treaty and additional articles, already inserted.)

  Now, therefore, the President of the United States of America, by
  and with the advice and consent of the Senate, hereby declares that
  the United States accede to the said convention of the twenty-second
  August, 1864, and also accede to the said convention of October 20,
  1868.

  Done at Washington this first day of March in the year of our Lord
  one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence
  of the United States the one hundred and sixth.

  (Seal.)                                         CHESTER A. ARTHUR.

  By the President.
    FRED'K T. FRELINGHUYSEN,
             _Secretary of State_.

The same day the president of the American Association sent by cablegram
to President Moynier, of the International Committee at Geneva, the glad
tidings that the United States had at last joined in the great humane
work of the world by ratifying the treaties of the Red Cross; and on the
twenty-fourth of the same month, President Moynier replied as follows:


                           COMITE INTERNATIONAL DE SECOURS
                                        AUX MILITAIRES BLESSES,
                                           GENEVA, _March 24, 1882_.

  MISS CLARA BARTON, _President of the American Society of the Red
  Cross, Washington_:

  MADEMOISELLE: At last, on the seventeenth instant, I received your
  glorious telegram. I delayed replying to it in order to communicate
  its contents to my colleagues of the International Committee, so as
  to be able to thank you in the name of all of us and to tell you of
  the joy it gives us. You must feel happy too, and proud to have at
  last attained your object, thanks to a perseverance and a zeal which
  surmounted every obstacle.

  Please, if opportunity offers, to be our interpreter to President
  Arthur and present him our warmest congratulations.

  I suppose your government will now notify the Swiss Federal Council
  of its decision in the matter, and the latter will then inform the
  other Powers which have signed the Red Cross Treaty.

  Only after this formality shall have been complied with can we
  occupy ourselves with fixing the official international status of
  your American society. We have, however, already considered the
  circular which we intend to address to all the societies of the Red
  Cross, and with regard thereto we have found that it will be
  necessary for us as a preliminary measure to be furnished with a
  document certifying that the American society has attained the
  second of its objects, _i.e._, that it has been (officially)
  recognized by the American Government.

  It is important that we be able to certify that your government is
  prepared to accept your services in case of war; that it will
  readily enter into co-operation with you, and will encourage the
  centralization under your direction of all the voluntary aid. We
  have no doubt that you will readily obtain from the competent
  authorities an official declaration to that effect, and we believe
  that this matter will be merely a formality, _but we attach the
  greatest importance to the fact in order to cover our
  responsibility, especially in view of the pretensions of rival
  societies which might claim to be acknowledged by us_.

  It is your society alone and none other that we will recognize,
  because it inspires us with confidence, and _we would be placed in a
  false position if you failed to obtain for it a privileged position
  by a formal recognition by the government_.

  We hope that you will appreciate the motives of caution which guide
  us in this matter, and that you may soon enable us to act in the
  premises.

  Wishing to testify to you its gratitude for the services you have
  already rendered to the Red Cross, the committee decided to offer to
  you one of the medals which a German engraver caused to be struck
  off in 1870 in honor of the Red Cross. It will be sent to you in a
  few days. It is of very small intrinsic value indeed, but, such as
  it is, we have no other means of recompensing the most meritorious
  of our assistants. Please to regard it only as a simple memorial,
  and as a proof of the esteem and gratitude we feel for you.

  Accept, mademoiselle, the assurance of my most distinguished
  sentiments.

                                            G. MOYNIER, _President_.

The requirements contained in the foregoing letter, in regard to
the recognition of the American Association of the Red Cross, were
fully and generously complied with by the various branches of the
Government of the United States, and the documents conveying the
official recognition were transmitted by the Honorable Secretary of
State to the American consul at Geneva, with instructions to deliver
them to the International Committee.

The following is the proclamation by President Arthur announcing
to the people the adoption by the United States of the Treaty of
Geneva, and the Additional Articles concerning the Navy:


By the President of the United States of America:

                            A PROCLAMATION.

  _Whereas_, on the twenty-second day of August, 1864, a convention
  was concluded at Geneva, in Switzerland, between the Grand Duchy of
  Baden and the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Belgium, the
  Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Empire, the
  Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the
  Netherlands, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Prussia, and
  the Kingdom of WÃ¼rtemberg, for the amelioration of the wounded in
  armies in the field, the tenor of which convention is hereinafter
  subjoined:

  _And whereas_, the several contracting parties to the said
  convention exchanged the ratification thereof at Geneva on the
  twenty-second day of June, 1865;

  _And whereas_, the several states hereinafter named have adhered to
  the said convention in virtue of Article IX. thereof, to wit:

  Sweden, December 13, 1864; Greece, January 5-17, 1865; Great
  Britain, February 18, 1865; Mecklenburg-Schwerin, March 9, 1865;
  Turkey, July 5, 1865; WÃ¼rtemberg, June 22, 1866; Hesse, June 2,
  1866; Bavaria, June 30, 1866; Austria, July 21, 1866; Persia,
  December 5, 1874; Salvador, December 30, 1874; Montenegro, November
  17-29, 1875; Servia, March 24, 1876; Bolivia, October 16, 1879;
  Chili, November 15, 1879; Argentine Republic, November 25, 1879;
  Peru, April 22, 1880.

  _And whereas_, the Swiss Confederation, in virtue of the said
  Article IX. of said convention, has invited the United States of
  America to accede thereto;

  _And whereas_, on the twentieth October, 1868, the following
  additional articles were proposed and signed at Geneva, on behalf of
  Great Britain, Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
  Italy, Netherlands, North Germany, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland,
  Turkey and WÃ¼rtemberg, the tenor of which Additional Articles is
  hereinafter subjoined (see page 74);

  _And whereas_, the President of the United States of America, by and
  with the advice and consent of the Senate, did, on the first day of
  March, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, declare that the
  United States accede to the said convention of the twenty-second of
  August, 1864, and also accede to the said convention of October 20,
  1868;

  _And whereas_, on the ninth day of June, one thousand eight hundred
  and eighty-two, the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, in
  virtue of the final provision of a certain minute of the exchange of
  the ratifications of the said convention at Berne, December 22,
  1864, did, by a formal declaration, accept the said adhesion of the
  United States of America, as well in the name of the Swiss
  Confederation as in that of the other contracting states;

  _And whereas_, furthermore, the Government of the Swiss
  Confederation has informed the Government of the United States that
  the exchange of the ratifications of the aforesaid Additional
  Articles of the twentieth October, 1868, to which the United States
  of America have, in like manner, adhered as aforesaid, has not yet
  taken place between the contracting parties, and that these articles
  cannot be regarded as a treaty in full force and effect;

  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Chester A. Arthur, President of
  the United States of America, have caused the said Convention Treaty
  of August 22, 1864, to be made public, to the end that the same and
  every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with
  good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof; reserving,
  however, the promulgation of the hereinbefore mentioned Additional
  Articles of October 20, 1868, notwithstanding the accession of the
  United States of America thereto, until the exchange of the
  ratifications thereof between the several contracting states shall
  have been effected, and the said Additional Articles shall have
  acquired full force and effect as an international treaty.

  In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal
  of the United States to be affixed.

  Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of July, in
  the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and
  of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and
  seventh.

  (L.S.)
                                                  CHESTER A. ARTHUR.
  By the President,
    FRED'K T. FRELINGHUYSEN,
           _Secretary of State_.

  _United States of America, Department of State, to all to whom these
     presents shall come, greeting_:

  I certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the original on file
  in the Department of State.

  In testimony whereof I, John Davis, Acting Secretary of State of the
  United States, have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal
  of the Department of State to be affixed.

  Done at the city of Washington, this ninth day of August, A.D. 1882,
  and of the Independence of the United States of America the one
  hundred and seventh.

  (L.S.)
                                                          JOHN DAVIS.

Thus was the American branch of the Red Cross welcomed into
the fellowship of kindred associations in thirty-one other nations, the
most prosperous and civilized on the globe, its position assured, and its
future course made simple, direct and untroubled.

The official bulletin of the International Committee also hailed the
accession of the United States to the treaty, in an article of
characteristic caution and of great significance. In that article, which
is quoted in full hereafter, the distinction was carefully pointed out
between that which had already been fully agreed to, and had become
invested with all the force and solemnity of international treaties, and
the proposed amendment which had been drawn up and considered with a
view to ultimate adoption. This proposed amendment had received the
sanction and signatures of the International Committee at Geneva,
without ever having been formally adopted by any nation. The United
States had, at the same moment adopted both, thus becoming the
thirty-second nation to adhere to the treaty of August 22, 1864, and the
_first_ to adopt the proposed amendment of October 20, 1868.


[_International Bulletin for April, 1882._]

ADHESION OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CONVENTION OF GENEVA.

  Referring to the article inserted in our preceding bulletin, p. 42,
  we are happy to be able to announce that the act of adhesion which
  we presented was signed at Washington the sixteenth of March, in
  pursuance of a vote by which the members of the Senate gave their
  approval with unanimity. Our readers will doubtless be surprised, as
  we are, that after the long and systematic resistance of the
  Government of the United States against rallying to the Convention
  of Geneva, there cannot be found in the American legislature a
  single representative of the opposition. So complete a reversal of
  opinion cannot be explained, unless we admit that the chief officers
  of the nation had cherished, up to the present time, prejudices in
  regard to the Convention of Geneva--prejudices which vanished as
  soon as they fully comprehended what was expected of them, and
  recognized that there was nothing compromising in it to the
  political condition of their country.

  With the zeal of new converts, they have even gone beyond the mark,
  inasmuch as they have voted their adhesion not only to the
  convention of the twenty-second of August, 1864, but also to the
  plan of Additional Articles of the twentieth of October, 1868, which
  was not the matter in question, since they had never had the force
  of law; we give this news only under every reserve, because we have
  received contradictory information on the subject. If this defect in
  form is found in the official document which will be sent to the
  Swiss Federal Council one could fear it might retard the so much
  desired conclusion of this important affair, but it need not be too
  much regretted, since it will enable us to understand the opinion of
  the great Transatlantic Republic upon maritime questions as they
  relate to the Red Cross.

The action of the United States, mentioned in this article, was perhaps
somewhat characteristic. It seemed to give itself to the movement of the
Red Cross with a gracious earnestness seldom seen in the cautious forms
of diplomatic action, and it certainty was in very decided contrast with
its former hesitancy.

No doubt could now rest in any mind that the adhesion of the United
States was, at last, hearty and sincere, and calculated to allay any
distrust which its former isolation and declination of the treaty might
have anywhere engendered.

This action of the Government of the United States also rendered the
position of the National Association exceptionally satisfactory, and
introduced it to the International Committee at Geneva and all the
affiliated societies under circumstances calculated to promote in the
greatest degree its usefulness and harmony, and to add to the
gratification of all who personally have any part in the operations of
the American Association.

For all this it is indebted to the judicious and thoughtful care and
exalted statesmanship of the President of the United States, his cabinet
and advisers, and the members of the Forty-seventh Congress, who,
without one breath of criticism, or one moment of delay, after they came
to fully understand the subject and comprehend its purposes and object,
granted all that was then asked of them, in the adhesion to the
treaties, in the recognition of the National Association, and the
provisions for printing and disseminating a knowledge of its principles
and practical work.

Perhaps no act of this age or country has reflected more credit abroad
upon those specially active in it, than this simple and beneficent
measure. It must, in its great and humane principles, its far-reaching
philanthropy, its innovations upon the long established and accepted
customs and rules of barbaric cruelty, its wise practical charity, stand
forever next to the immortal proclamation of freedom to the slaves that
crowns the name of Abraham Lincoln.

Special thanks are peculiarly due to those who have been its active,
wise and unwavering friends, who have planned its course so truly, and
set forth its purposes so clearly, that it will hereafter be
misunderstood only by those who are unwilling to learn, or who are
actively hostile to its beneficent aims.

Perhaps at the risk of seeming invidious--for we would by no means
ignore, and have no less gratitude for the legion of generous helpers we
cannot name--we might state that among those who have been foremost to
aid and encourage us have been the Hon. Omar D. Conger, of Michigan,
who, first in the House, and afterward in the Senate, has been
conspicuous for persistent and courageous work; also, Hon. William
Windom, of Minnesota, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who
was first to investigate and take the matter up as a member of President
Garfield's cabinet; Senator E.P. Lapham, of New York, who has spared
neither time nor thought, patience nor labor, in his legal
investigations of the whole matter; and probably no person has done more
than he to throw light upon obscure parts and point out the true and
proper course to be pursued in the accomplishment of the work, and the
acceptance of the treaty. Senators Morgan, of Alabama; Edmunds, of
Vermont; Hawley, of Connecticut; Anthony, of Rhode Island; Hoar, of
Massachusetts, all accorded to it their willing interest and aid.
Indeed, all sections and parties have seemed eager to help the Red
Cross; a result that might, perhaps, have been anticipated, since it
asks only an opportunity to faithfully work according to methods
approved by thoughtful experience, and toward ends that all humane
persons must approve.

To the American newspaper press, and perhaps to the New York _Herald_
more than to any other newspaper, through its international character,
wonderful enterprise, and far-reaching circulation, the Red Cross is
indebted for timely aid and noble furtherance of its objects and aims.
It has been quick to discern their substantial character, and generous
and full in commending them. Still, the same difficulty confronts us in
regard to publications as persons--where all have been so willing it is
difficult to distinguish. Not less than three hundred periodicals and
papers have, within the last two years, laid upon our desk their
graceful tribute of encouraging and fitly spoken words, and it has been
given as an estimate of an experienced city editor, gathered through his
exchanges, that over five hundred editorial notices were given of our
little Red Cross book of last year, and these, invariably, so far as met
our eyes, kindly approving and encouraging. The capacity of the Red
Cross to carry on most wisely and well its beneficent work must in the
future, as it has done in the past, depend largely upon the active and
cordial co-operation of the newspaper press; and we do not doubt that it
will continue to receive the same prompt and efficient assistance so
long as it shall continue to deserve it.

By the combined assistance of all these powerful friends of the Red
Cross, the country has at last been rescued from the position in which
it had been standing for the last seventeen years--a puzzling wonder to
its admiring friends, a baffling enigma to all, treating its enemies
subdued with romantic generosity, and its enemies taken captive in war
with all the tenderness of friends, and yet, clinging, apparently with
intense fierceness, to an unsocial isolation, to savage rules and
regulations of war that only barbarians would ever wish to practice,
pouring out its beneficence in astonishing prodigality, and in untold
volume, variety and value upon strangers, and yet seemingly hesitating
only when it was proposed by international law and system to use and not
waste its magnificent voluntary offerings, but to entrust them all to
responsible agents, trained in the very torrent and tempest of battle,
to wisely apply this generosity to the great and awful needs of
war--agents held to business rules, with calm accountability amid
distraction and panic, trained to protect material, to give and take
receipts, and at last to account faithfully for everything entrusted to
them, like the officers of a well-regulated bank.

The final adhesion of the United States to the treaty of the Red Cross
has created a lively sense of satisfaction in all its affiliated
societies wherever, throughout the world, its beneficent work is carried
on; particularly, by the International Committee of Geneva, has this
wise and simple act of beneficence and common sense and common humanity
been regarded with sentiments of gratitude and renewed hope. The
American National Association has received the following expression of
the sentiments of the noble and philanthropic president of the
International Committee, written upon the receipt from the United States
of the official documents of recognition:


                           COMITE INTERNATIONAL DE SECOURS
                                         AUX MILITAIRES BLESSES,
                                            GENEVA, _September 6, 1882_.

  MISS CLARA BARTON, _Washington, D.C._:

  MADEMOISELLE: I come to thank and congratulate you cordially upon
  your new success. I have read your letters of the 11th and 14th with
  the most lively interest, and I have also received, through the
  medium of the United States consul at Geneva, all the official
  documents which you have announced to me.

  The position of your society is now entirely (_tout Ã¡ fait_)
  correct, and nothing more opposes itself; so that by a circular we
  can now make it known to the societies of other countries. I am
  already occupied in the preparation of this document, but I am
  obliged to leave for Turin, where I go to attend the reunion of the
  International Institute of Law, and it will not be until my return,
  say about the twentieth of September, that I can press the printing
  of the circular. In any case, it will be ready before the end of the
  month.

  Accept, mademoiselle, the assurance of my distinguished sentiments.

                                             G. MOYNIER, _President_.


The circular alluded to in this letter of M. Moynier announces the
adhesion of the United States to the great international compact of the
Red Cross, and authenticates and opens the way for the voluntary
action of the people and the government in international humanitarian
action, through the medium of the American Association of the Red
Cross, and is in the following terms:


                        INTERNATIONAL CIRCULAR.

          INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE. FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN
                       SOCIETY OF THE RED CROSS.

    FIFTIETH CIRCULAR TO THE PRESIDENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
                          CENTRAL COMMITTEES.

                                     GENEVA, _September 2, 1882_.

  GENTLEMEN: When on the twenty-third of August, 1876, we announced to
  you by our thirty-fourth circular, that the American society for aid
  to the wounded had had only an ephemeral existence, and had finished
  by dissolution, we still entertained the hope of seeing it revive,
  and we asked the friends of the Red Cross to labor with us for its
  resuscitation.

  To-day we have the great satisfaction of being able to tell you that
  this appeal has been heard, and that the United States is again
  linked anew to the chain of our societies.

  Nevertheless it is not the old association which has returned to
  life. That which we present to you at this time has a special origin
  upon which we ought to give you some details.

  Its whole history is associated with a name already known to you,
  that of Miss Clara Barton. Without the energy and perseverance of
  this remarkable woman we should probably not for a long time have
  had the pleasure of seeing the Red Cross revived in the United
  States. We will not repeat here what we have said elsewhere of the
  claims of Miss Barton to our gratitude, and we will confine
  ourselves to mentioning what she has done to reconstruct a Red Cross
  society in North America.

  After having prepared the ground by divers publications, she called
  together a great meeting at Washington on the twenty-first of May,
  1881; then a second, on the ninth of June, at which the existence of
  the society was solemnly set forth. On the same day President
  Garfield nominated Miss Barton as president of this institution.

  The International Committee would have desired from that time to
  have given notice of the event to all the central committees, but
  certain scruples restrained it.

  Remembering that the first American society had been rendered
  powerless by the distinct refusal of the cabinet at Washington to
  adhere to the Geneva Convention, it took precaution and declared it
  would wait, before recognizing the young society, until the
  government should have regularly signed the treaty of 1864. Miss
  Barton, understanding the special propriety of this requirement,
  redoubled her efforts to attain this end, and we know that on the
  first of March she gained a complete victory upon this point.

  There remained another question with respect to which the
  International Committee did not feel itself sufficiently informed.
  Just how far was the American Government disposed to accept the
  services of this society? We have often said, and we repeat it, that
  a society which would be exposed, for the want of a previous
  understanding, to find itself forbidden access to its own army in
  case of war, would be at fault fundamentally, and would not be
  qualified to take its place in the International concert. Further
  upon this point Miss Barton and the members of the American Central
  Committee, sought to enter into our views. They conferred with the
  competent authorities. The desired recognition was very difficult to
  obtain, for it was contrary to American customs and traditions. It
  was, nevertheless, accomplished after considerable discussion. On
  this point Miss Barton has stated to us that the government, in
  acquiescing in the decision which had been expressed, was entering
  upon a path altogether new, and that the official recognition of the
  Red Cross Society was for the latter a very exceptional honor.

  Certain documents resulted therefrom which have been communicated to
  us directly by the Secretary of State, at Washington, showing:

  1st. That the American Association of the Red Cross has been legally
  constituted by an Act of Congress.

  2d. That President Arthur has declared himself in full sympathy with
  the work, and very willingly has accepted the presidency of the
  Board of Consultation.

  3d. That the principal members of the cabinet have consented to
  become members of a board of trustees, empowered to receive
  subscriptions and to hold the funds for the society.

  4th. Finally, that Congress unanimously, without discussion or
  opposition, has voted a sum of one thousand dollars, to be expended
  by the government in printed matter, designed to inform the people
  of the United States of the organization of the Red Cross. The
  initiation of this last measure was not the work of the society but
  of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; consequently it
  bears witness to the spontaneous impulse with which the Houses of
  Congress came into accord with the views of Miss Barton.

  We must add that the International Committee attaches so much the
  more importance to the fact that this society took an official
  position, because there was created, at nearly the same time in the
  United States, two other institutions, claiming to pursue a similar
  object, but of which the Committee of Geneva is absolutely ignorant.
  One, called "The Woman's National Relief Association," which
  concerns itself with all public calamities, among other things with
  the calamities of war, but more especially with shipwrecks, and has
  for its distinctive emblem a blue anchor; the other has taken the
  name of "The Order of the Red Cross." Dr. James Saunders is the
  president of it, with the title "Supreme Commander." This order
  proposes to organize more or less in a military way and appears
  desirous of imitating the orders of chivalry in ancient times.

  The American Central Committee of the Red Cross has its seat at
  Washington, but has already founded branches in other localities, at
  Dansville, Rochester, Syracuse, etc. Soon, doubtless, cities of the
  first class will also take their turn.

  We will give in our next bulletin the complete text of the
  constitution and by-laws of the American society, which, as will be
  seen, has not believed it ought to limit its program to assistance
  in case of war, but has comprised within it, in conformity with a
  suggestion of the conference at Berlin, the other great calamities
  which might befall the country and its inhabitants.

  As for ourselves, we have greeted with joy the addition of the
  United States to the countries already enrolled under the Red Cross;
  it is for our work an important and long desired reinforcement, and
  we doubt not our impressions in this regard will be shared by the
  twenty-eight central committees to which we address these lines.

  We also hope that next year some representatives of the American
  society will cross the Atlantic in order to fraternize with the
  delegates of the other nations, who will certainly be happy to meet
  them at the conference at Vienna.

  Receive, gentlemen, the assurances of our distinguished
  consideration.

  For the International Committee of the Red Cross.

                                              President: G. MOYNIER.

  Secretary: G. ADOR.


The foregoing pages deal only with the official history of the Red Cross
and its inauguration in this country, closing with the accession of the
United States to the Treaty and its promulgation in 1882. The original
formation of the Red Cross was had previous to the adoption of the
Treaty by the government, and, indeed, primarily for that very purpose.
That was the corner-stone upon which rested the entire structure of the
Red Cross in America at that date, and constituted almost entirely the
work undertaken by it to perform.

During the first ten years of the existence of the organization it had
accomplished all that had been promised, and a great deal more; and had
proved the utility of its work on almost continuous fields of national
calamity of the character defined in the "American Amendment" to the
Treaty. But the American government had not given the Red Cross the
official recognition that it desired and was entitled to; and it could
not take its appropriate place by the government of which it was so
eminently a part. As long as government provides for war, so long must
it recognize its adopted twin sister of peace, the Red Cross; as long as
it finds it necessary to deliberately mutilate men, so long should it
take part in healing them.

In order to strengthen the organization, and make its influence more
widely felt, the members decided to adopt a plan that would enable them
to work on a somewhat broader basis; accordingly, on April 17, 1893, the
Red Cross was reincorporated and has continued its labors up to the
present time under the provisions of the instrument a copy of which
follows:


THE RE-INCORPORATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS.

  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS.

  Know all men by these presents, that we, Clara Barton, Julian B.
  Hubbell, Stephen E. Barton, Peter V. DeGraw and George Kennan, all
  being persons of full age, citizens of the United States, and a
  majority residents of the District of Columbia, being desirous of
  forming an association to carry on the benevolent and humane work of
  "The Red Cross" in accordance with the Articles of the International
  Treaty of Geneva, Switzerland, entered into on the twenty-second day
  of August, 1864, and adopted by the Government of the United States
  on the first day of March, 1882, and also in accordance with the
  broader scope given to the humane work of said treaty by "The
  American Association of the Red Cross," and known as "The American
  Amendment," whereby the suffering incident to great floods, famines,
  epidemics, conflagrations, cyclones, or other disasters of national
  magnitude, may be ameliorated by the administering of necessary
  relief; and being desirous of continuing the noble work heretofore
  performed by "The American Association of the Red Cross,"
  incorporated in the District of Columbia for the purpose of securing
  the adoption of the said Treaty of Geneva by the United States, for
  benevolent and charitable purposes, and to co-operate with the
  Comite International de Secours aux Militaires Blesses.

  Now, therefore, for the purpose of creating ourselves, our
  associates and successors, a body politic and corporate in name and
  in fact, we do hereby associate ourselves together under and by
  virtue of sections 545, 546, 547, 548, 549 and 550 of the Revised
  Statutes of the United States relating to the District of Columbia,
  as amended and in force at this time; and do make, sign and
  acknowledge this Certificate of Incorporation, as follows, to wit:

  _First._--The name by which this association shall be known in law
  is: "The American National Red Cross."

  _Second._--The principal office of the association shall be in the
  City of Washington, District of Columbia.

  _Third._--The term of its existence shall be fifty years from the
  date of this certificate.

  _Fourth._--The objects of this association shall be, in addition to
  the purposes set forth in the above preamble, as follows, to wit:

  1. To garner the store materials, articles, supplies, moneys, or
  property of whatsoever name or nature, and to maintain a system of
  national relief and administer the same in the mitigation of human
  suffering incident to war, pestilence, famine, flood, or other
  calamities.

  2. To hold itself in readiness for communicating and co-operating
  with the Government of the United States, or any Department thereof,
  or with the "Comite International de Secours aux Militaires
  Blesses," of Geneva, Switzerland, to the end that the merciful
  provisions of the said "International Treaty of Geneva" may be more
  wisely and effectually carried out.

Immediately following our accession to the Treaty of Geneva, March 1,
1882, the president of the Red Cross was asked by the Committee on
Foreign Relations of the Senate, to prepare a history of the Red Cross
for publication by them through the government printing office. This was
done, and a book of two hundred and twenty-seven pages was issued,
giving an account of the origin of the organization, the steps by which
it became a treaty, of our own initiation, and not only the exact text
by which our accession was made, but that of every other nation within
the treaty up to that time, 1882.

A bill for a reprint by Congress of fifty thousand copies of this book
was lost in the session of 1898 through lack of time.

No consecutive book has been published by us since that date, but the
history has been perhaps even more fully told, and that scores of times,
in public addresses which its president and assistants have been called
to make before great assemblies, selections from some of which will
appear in this volume, as the fullest information given in the most
compact manner that we can render in the short space of time allotted
us.

The very title of the organization, viz.: "Relief in War," has been a
misnomer, and through all the early years especially was very generally
misunderstood by the public. I have not unfrequently been invited and
innocently urged to attend peace meetings and large charity gatherings
for the poor and afflicted on the ground of needing instruction myself;
inasmuch as I "was engaged in advocating war, wouldn't it be well to
hear something on the other side?" And I have been invited to become
party to a discussion in which the merits of peace and war should be
compared.

Large organizations of women, the best in the country, and, I believe,
the best in the world, have faithfully labored with me to merge the Red
Cross into their society as a part of woman's work; without the smallest
conception or realization of its scope, its international character, its
treaty obligations, and the official ground it was liable at any time to
be called to occupy.

Many charming invitations, from ladies even more charming, to address
their convention or meeting, have still contained some well chosen word
which might imply a question, if indeed the Red Cross really were the
humane and philanthropic institution it claimed to be; naturally the
address usually dealt with the question as it was put.

I name these facts as mere relics of the past, amusing now, but
instructive to you of the present day (when no child even questions the
motives of the Red Cross), as showing what it had to meet and live
through in order to live at all.

In order to show the enthusiastic devotees of the present year how
questionable the beneficence of the Red Cross appeared to the best
people only a few years ago, I introduce the following address, read, by
request, before a congress of women, 1895 or 1896, hoping that the
charitably disposed reader will understand and appreciate the state of
mind engendered by the title of the request made, and forgive any
seeming acerbity:


                                 ADDRESS.

       WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS IN ITS RELATION
                            TO PHILANTHROPY?

I am asked to say something upon the "Significance of the Red Cross in
its Relation to Philanthropy." I am not sure that I understand precisely
what is desired.

If a morning paper should announce that three or four of the greatest
political bosses or greatest railroad kings in the country had quietly
met somewhere, and sat with closed doors till long after midnight, and
then silently departed, people would ask, "What is the significance of
that? What mischief have they been devising in secret?" In that sense of
the word, _significance_--which is a very common one--the Red Cross has
none that I ever heard of. It has no rich offices to bestow, no
favorites to reward, no enemies to punish. It has no secrets to keep, no
mystic word or sign. Its proceedings would, and do, make a valuable
library, accessible to all men and all women from Norway to New Zealand.

I will not say that it is so simple and common in character that he who
runs may read, but surely she who desires information can sit down, read
and obtain it. The Red Cross has been quietly doing its work for thirty
years and is now established in forty independent nations. No other
institution on earth, not even Christianity, has a public recognition so
nearly universal. None has ever adhered more closely to its one single
purpose of alleviating human suffering. Has that any significance or any
connection with philanthropy? Let us see.

An institution or reform movement that is not selfish, must originate in
the recognition of some evil that is adding to the sum of human
suffering, or diminishing the sum of happiness. I suppose it is a
philanthropic movement to try to reverse the process. Christianity,
temperance and sanitary regulations in general are examples. Great evils
die hard; and all that has yet been done is to keep them within as
narrow limits as possible. Of these great evils, war is one. War is in
its very nature cruel--the very embodiment of cruelty in its
effects--not necessarily in the hearts of the combatants. Baron Macaulay
thought it not a mitigation but an aggravation of the evil, that men of
tender culture and humane feelings, with no ill will, should stand up
and kill each other. But men do not go to war to save life. They might
save life by keeping the peace and staying at home. They go solely with
intent to inflict so much pain, loss and disaster on the enemy that he
will yield to their terms. All their powers to hurt are focused upon
him.

In a moving army the elements of destruction, armed men and munitions of
war, have the right of way; and the means of preserving and sustaining
even their own lives are left to bring up the rear as they best can.
Hence, when the shock and crash of battle is over, and troops are
advancing or retreating and all roads are blocked, and the medical staff
trying to force its way through with supplies, prompt and adequate
relief can scarcely ever reach the wounded. The darkness of night comes
down upon them like a funeral pall, as they lie in their blood, tortured
with thirst and traumatic fever. The memory of such scenes set a kindly
Swiss gentleman to thinking of ways and means for alleviating their
horrors. In time, and by efforts whose history must be familiar to many
of you, there resulted the Geneva Convention for the relief of the sick
and wounded of armies. I shall not trace its history, as it seems to be
more to the present purpose to explain briefly what it proposed to do,
and how it proceeded to do it.

The convention found two prime evils to consider. First, the existence
of war itself; second, the vast amount of needless cruelty it inflicted
upon its victims. For the first of these, with the world full of
standing armies, every boundary line of nations fixed and held by the
sword, and the traditions of four thousand years behind its customs, the
framers of the convention, however earnest and devoted, could scarcely
hope to find an immediate, if indeed, a perceptible mitigation. Only
time, prolonged effort, national economics, universal progress and the
pressure of public opinion could ever hope to grapple with this monster
evil of the ages.

But the second--if it were not possible to dispense with the needless
cruelties heretofore inflicted upon the victims of war, thus relieving
human misery to that extent, seemed to the framers of the convention a
reasonable question to be considered. This is what it proposed to do. A
few sentences will explain how it proceeded to do it.

A convention was called at Geneva, Switzerland, for the fourth of
August, 1864, to be composed of delegates accredited by the heads of the
governments of the world, who should discuss the practices of war and
ascertain to what extent the restraints of the established military code
in its dealing with the sick and wounded of armies were needful for the
benefit of the service; and to what extent they were needless, of
benefit to no one, causing only suffering, of no strength to the
service, and might be done away with; and to what extent war-making
powers could agree to enter into a legal compact to that end. The
consideration, discussion and concessions of two weeks produced a
proposed agreement which took the form of a compound treaty, viz: A
treaty of one government with many governments--the first ever made--a
compact known as the Treaty of Geneva, for the relief of the sick and
wounded in war.

Its basis was neutrality. It made neutral all sick, wounded, or disabled
soldiers at a field; all persons, as surgeons, nurses and attendants,
who cared for them; all supplies of medicine or food for their use; all
field and military hospitals with their equipments; all gifts from
neutral nations for the use of the sick and wounded of any army; all
houses near a battlefield that would receive and nurse wounded men: none
of these should be subject to capture. It provided for the sending of
wounded men to their homes, rather than to prison; that friend and foe
should be nursed together and alike in all military hospitals; and, most
of all, that the people who had always been forcibly restrained from
approaching any field of action for purposes of relief, however needed
(with the single exception of our Sanitary Commission, and that under
great difficulties and often under protest) should not only be allowed
this privilege, but should arm and equip themselves with relief of all
kinds, with the right to enter the lines for the helpless; thus
relieving not alone the wounded and dying, but the armies of their care.

It provided a universal sign by which all this relief, both of persons
and material, should be designated and known. A Greek red cross on a
field of white should tell any soldier of any country within the treaty
that the wearer was his friend and could be trusted; and to any officer
of any army that he was legitimately there and not subject to capture.

Some forty nations are in that treaty, and from every military hospital
in every one of these nations floats the same flag; and every active
soldier in all their armies knows that he can neither capture nor harm
the shelter beneath it, though it be but a little "A" tent in the
enemy's lines, and every disabled man knows it is his rescue and his
home.

It may be interesting to know the formula of this compact. It recognizes
one head, the International Committee of Geneva, Switzerland, through
which all communications are made. One national head in each country
which receives such communications, transmitting them to its government.
The ratifying power of the treaty is the Congress of Berne. The
organization in each nation receives from its government its high moral
sanction and recognition, but is in no way supported or materially aided
by it. _The Red Cross means not national aid for the needs of the
people, but the people's aid for the needs of the nation._ The awakening
patriotism of the last few years should, I think, make this feature more
readily apprehended.

As the foreign nations furnish the only illustrations of the value and
material aid of the Red Cross in war, let us glance at what it has
accomplished.

The first important war after the birth of the Treaty of Geneva, was
between Germany, Italy and Austria. Austria had not, at that time,
entered the treaty, and yet its objects were understood and its spirit
found a responsive chord in the hearts of the people. Over $400,000,
beside a great amount of material, were collected by that country, and
made use of for the relief of the combatants. Italy was fairly well
organized and rendered excellent service, furnishing much substantial
assistance. Germany, which was in the vanguard of the treaty nations,
was thoroughly organized and equipped. She was the first to demonstrate
the true idea of the Red Cross--people's aid for national, for military,
necessity. Great storehouses had been provided at central points, where
vast supplies were collected. In an incredibly short time, between
$3,000,000 and $4,000,000 were raised for relief purposes, and large
numbers of volunteers came to help the already organized corps of
workers. Great trains of supplies were sent to the front. The wounded
enemy was tenderly cared for, and everything was accomplished so well
and so systematically, that it proved the incalculable value of
organized, authorized, civil aid. French and Swiss Red Cross workers
also rendered great assistance, this being the first instance of
neutrals taking an active part.

In the Franco-Prussian War the German Red Cross performed even better
service, it having learned many valuable lessons in the German-Austrian
conflict, and through their efforts an infinite amount of good was
accomplished and great suffering averted. Not only were the wounded and
sick soldiers tenderly cared for, but the unprovided families of
soldiers were also supplied. The French Red Cross at the breaking out of
the war was poorly organized and penniless. Within one month, however,
hospitals had been established, ambulances and a large amount of field
supplies were at the front, with a considerable relief force to care for
the sick and wounded. The French Association, not including the branches
in the provinces, spent over $2,000,000 and assisted 110,000 wounded.
Many neutral Red Cross nations assisted in rendering aid and relief in
this great war. England alone sent a million and a half dollars, besides
twelve hundred cases of stores. Eighty-five thousand sick, wounded and
famishing French soldiers entered Switzerland, and were cared for by the
Central Committee at Berne. The International Committee at Geneva, in
one instance, asked for and obtained 2500 seriously wounded French
soldiers, supplied their wants, and sent them to their own country.

In the great Russo-Turkish War, the Red Cross of Russia, splendidly
equipped, with ample means and royal patronage, was, at the beginning of
hostilities, greatly hampered by the jealousy of the military. The
relief organizations were assigned places well in the rear; but ere many
months had passed the military surgeons gladly accepted the Red Cross
aid, and colossal work did it perform. Over $13,000,000 were raised, and
all that was necessary spent in supplying relief. The neutral Red Cross
countries furnished valuable assistance in this war also.

In the recent war between Japan and China, you undoubtedly read of the
wonderful work performed by the Japanese Red Cross. This society
followed the precedent of Germany, in tenderly caring for the wounded
enemy, even though fighting against a nation not in the treaty. Japan
had a cruel, merciless enemy to fight, and yet her soldiers were
instructed to have respect even for a dead enemy.

It is needless to give further illustrations; history records the
wonderful achievements of this greatest of relief organizations, though
it cannot record the untold suffering which has been averted by it.

Is the Red Cross a humanitarian organization? What is the significance
of the Red Cross? I leave these two questions for you to answer.

But war, although the most tragic, is not the only evil that assails
humanity. War has occurred in the United States four times in one
hundred and twenty years. Four times its men have armed and marched, and
its women waited and wept. That is on an average of one war every thirty
years. It is now a little over thirty years since the last hostile gun
was fired; we fondly hope it may be many years before there is another.
A machine, even a human machine, called into active service only once in
thirty years is liable to get out of working order; hence to keep it in
condition for use, no less than for the possible good it might do, the
American Society of the Red Cross asked to have included in its charter
the privilege of rendering such aid as it could in great public
calamities, as fires, floods, cyclones, famines and pestilence.

In a time of profound peace that has been the only possible field of
activity. It is not for me to say whether that field has been
successfully cultivated, but a few of the facts will determine whether
the innovation upon the treaty will commend itself to your judgment, as
it has to those of the older societies of Europe.

Naturally it required not only diplomacy but arguments to obtain a
privilege never before officially considered in the unbroken customs of
an international treaty. They must be submitted to a foreign congress.
The same argument pertained fifteen years ago that pertains to-day,
namely, that in all our vast territory, subject to incalculable
disasters, with all our charitable, humane and benevolent associations,
there was not one which had for its object and duty to hold itself in
preparation and training to meet and relieve the woes of these
overmastering disasters. All would gladly aid, but there were none to
lead. Everybody's business was nobody's business, and the stricken
victims perished.

We asked that under the Red Cross Constitution of the United States its
national organization should be permitted to act in the capacity of Red
Cross relief agents, treating a national disaster like a field of
battle, proceed to it at once with experienced help, equipped with all
the needful supplies and means to commence relief, overlook and learn
the needs of the field, make immediate statements of the true condition
and wants to the people of the country, who, knowing the presence of the
Red Cross there, could, if desirable, make it the medium of their
contributions for relief either in money or material. To relieve the
necessities in every way possible, keep the people at large in
possession of reliable information, hold the field until relief has been
given, and retire when all needed aid has been rendered. This privilege
was graciously granted by the ratifying Congress at Berne, and is known
as the "American amendment" of the Red Cross. Nations since that date,
on becoming signatory to the treaty, have included that amendment in
their charters.

This is the principle upon which we have acted. The affording of relief
to the victims of great disasters anywhere in the United States, is what
the National Red Cross has proceeded to do, and it has confined itself
strictly to its privileges, acting only in disasters so great as to be
national. It never asks aid; never makes an appeal; it simply makes
statements of the real condition of the sufferers, leaving the people
free to exercise their own humanity through any medium they may prefer.

In the thirteen years of relief work by the Red Cross in the United
States, every dollar and every pound that has been received and
distributed by it, has been the free-will offering of the people, given
for humanity without solicitation, and dispensed without reward. It has
received nothing from the government. No fund has been created for it.
No contributions have been made except those to be distributed as relief
at its fields. Its officers serve without pay. There is not, nor ever
was, a salaried officer in it, and even its headquarters meets its own
costs. Among the various appropriations made by Congress for relief of
calamities in the past years, as in great river floods, not a dollar so
appropriated has ever been applied through the Red Cross, although
working on the same field. I name these facts, not by way of complaint,
or even comment, but to correct popular errors of belief, which I know
you would prefer to have corrected. True to its method, this is simply a
statement of the real condition of things, and left to the choice of the
people--the Red Cross itself is theirs, created for them, and it is
peculiarly their privilege to deal with it as they will.

The following list of calamities with the approximate value of material
furnished, as well as money, will give you some appreciation of the
services rendered in the cause of humanity by the American National Red
Cross. Limit of time and space forbids even an attempt at description of
its various fields. I can only name the most important, with estimated
values distributed on each:

  Michigan Forest Fires, 1881, material and money            $ 80,000
  Mississippi Floods, 1882, money and seeds                     8,000
  Mississippi Floods, 1883, material and seeds                 18,500
  Mississippi Cyclone, 1883, money                              1,000
  Balkan War, 1883, money                                         500
  Ohio and Mississippi Floods, 1884, feed for stock and
    people, clothing, tools, house furnishings                175,000
  Texas Famine, 1885, appropriations and contributions on
    statements made upon personal investigation               120,000
  Charleston Earthquake, 1886, money                              500
  Mt Vernon, Ill., Cyclone, 1888, money and supplies           85,000
  Florida Yellow Fever, 1888, physicians and nurses            15,000
  Johnstown Disaster, 1889, money and all kinds of material,
    buildings and furnishings                                 250,000
  Russian Famine, 1891-92, mainly food                        125,000
  Pomeroy, Iowa, Cyclone, 1893, money and nurses                2,700
  South Carolina Islands, 1893-94, money and all kinds of
    supplies and materials, tools, seeds, lumber, etc          65,000
                                                             --------
                                                             $946,200

Only about one-eighth of the above estimates represent cash; the balance
represents material.

In each of these emergencies something has been added to the sum of
human happiness, something subtracted from the sum of human woe; the
naked have been clothed, the hungry fed, new homes have sprung up from
the desolated ruins, crops revived, and activities and business
relations resumed. In a neighboring State and its adjacent islands
scarcely two hundred miles distant from this, could to-day be found
several thousand human beings, living in their homes, enjoying their
family lives, following their ordinary avocations, cultivating the
ground, who, if asked, would unhesitatingly tell you that but for the
help of the Red Cross, they would two years ago have been under the
ground they now cultivate.

If the alleviation of human miseries, the saving of life, and the
bringing of helplessness and dependence back to methods of
self-sustenance and independence are counted among the philanthropic
movements of the day, then to us, who have seen so much and worked so
long and so hard among it, it would seem that the Red Cross movement
has some "significance" in connection with philanthropy.

There remains but one question more. To whom is this movement due? Who
instituted it? In what minds did it originate? I wish I could say it was
all woman's work; but the truth compels the fact that this great, humane
idea originated with men; the movement was instituted by them. They
thought it out, and they wrought it out, and it was only meet and proper
that they should, for the terrible evil that made it necessary was
theirs as well. Women as a rule are not war-makers. For centuries the
caprices of men have plunged the world in strife, covered the earth's
surface with armies, and enriched its soil with the best blood that ever
flowed in human veins. It is only right that at length, in the cycle of
ages, something should touch man's heart and set him humbly down to find
out some way of mending as much of his mischief as he could. Perhaps he
"builded better than he knew," for in that one effort he touched the
spring that sooner or later will mend it all. No grander or truer
prophecy has ever been made than uttered in that first convention: "_The
Red Cross shall teach war to make war upon itself._" It is the most
practical and effective peace-maker and civilizer in the known world. It
reaches where nothing else can. If proof of this be wanting, study the
action of Japan in its late war.

But is man doing this work alone? No--gladly, no! Scarcely had he made
his first move, when the jeweled hands of royal woman glistened beside
him, and right royally have they borne their part. Glance at the
galaxy--the great leader and exemplar of them all, Empress Augusta of
Germany, her illustrious daughter, the Grand Duchess of Baden, Eugenia,
Empress Frederick, Victoria and Princess Louise of England, Margherita
of Italy, Natalia of Servia and the entire Court of Russia, and to-day
the present Empress of Germany, and the hard-working Empress of Japan,
with her faithful, weary court, even now busy in the hospitals of
convalescing Chinese. The various auxiliary societies of women of all
the principal Red Cross nations are a pride and a glory to humanity.

These nations have all two important features in their movement, which,
thus far, have not been accorded to us. Their governments have
instituted laws protecting the insignia and name of the Red Cross from
misuse and abuse as trademarks by unscrupulous venders, and
appropriation by false societies for dishonest purposes. This lack, and
this alone, has thus far rendered general organization in the United
States impracticable and unsafe. For seven years the most strenuous
efforts at protection have failed; the loss has been to the people in
general.

The second advantage of other nations is that citizens, the men of
wealth in those countries, have created a Red Cross fund for its use,
varying in amounts from a hundred thousand to several millions of
dollars. Russia, I believe, has a fund of some three millions. It seems
never to have occurred to our wealth-burdened men that possibly a little
satisfaction might be gained, some good accomplished, and some credit
done the nation by a step in that direction. It will dawn upon them some
day, not, perhaps, in mine, but in some of yours, and then, ladies, you
can well join hands with them, and discern more clearly than now the
"significance of the Red Cross as related to philanthropy."




THE MICHIGAN FOREST FIRES.


It may be necessary to recall to the mind of the person reading these
pages hastily, the fact that the National Red Cross of America was
formed nearly a year before the accession to the treaty. This was done
by the advice of President Garfield, in order to aid as far as possible
the accession. "Accordingly a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., May
21, 1881, which resulted in the formation of an association to be known
as the American National Association of the Red Cross."

Several years of previous illness on the part of its president had
resulted in fixing her country home at Dansville, N.Y., the seat of the
great Jackson and Austin Sanitarium and the acknowledged foundation of
the hundreds of health institutions of that kind which bless the country
to-day. The establishment of the National Red Cross in Washington had
attracted the attention of persons outside, who, of course, knew very
little of it; but among others, the people of Dansville, the home of the
president, felt that if she were engaged in some public movement, they
too might at least offer to aid. Accordingly, on her return to them in
midsummer, they waited upon her with a request to that effect, which
resulted in the formation of a society of the Red Cross, this being the
first body in aid of the National Association formed in the United
States. It is possible I cannot make that more clear than by giving an
extract from their report of that date, which was as follows:

  In reply to your request, given through the secretary of your
  association, that we make report to you concerning the inauguration
  of our society, its subsequent proceedings and present condition,
  the committee has the honor to submit the following statement:

  Dansville, Livingston County, N.Y., being the country residence of
  Miss Clara Barton, president of the American Association of the Red
  Cross, its citizens, desirous of paying a compliment to her, and at
  the same time of doing an honor to themselves, conceived the idea of
  organizing in their town the first local society of the Red Cross
  in the United States. To this end, a general preliminary meeting was
  held in the Presbyterian Church, when the principles of the Treaty
  of Geneva and the nature of its societies were defined in a clear
  and practical manner by Miss Barton, who had been invited to address
  the meeting. Shortly after, on the twenty-second of August, 1881, a
  second meeting, for the purpose of organization, held in the
  Lutheran Church and presided over by the pastor, Rev. Dr. Strobel,
  was attended by the citizens generally, including nearly all the
  religious denominations of the town, with their respective pastors.
  The purpose of the meeting was explained by your president, a
  constitution was presented and very largely signed, and officers
  were elected.

  Thus we are able to announce that on the eighteenth anniversary of
  the Treaty of Geneva, in Switzerland, August 22, 1864, was formed
  the first local society of the Red Cross in the United States of
  America.

Almost immediately following this occurred the memorable forest fires of
Michigan, which raged for days, sweeping everything before them--man,
beast, forests, farms--every living thing, until in one report made of
it we find this sentence: "So sweeping has been the destruction that
there is not food left in its track for a rabbit to eat, and, indeed, no
rabbit to eat it, if there were." Here occurred the first opportunity
for work that the young society had found, and again I give without
further note their report:

  Before a month had passed, before a thought of practical application
  to business had arisen, we were forcibly and sadly taught again the
  old lesson that we need but to build the altar, God will Himself
  provide the sacrifice. If we did not hear the crackling of the
  flames, our skies grew murky and dark and our atmosphere bitter with
  the drifting smoke that rolled over from the blazing fields of our
  neighbors of Michigan, whose living thousands fled in terror, whose
  dying hundreds writhed in the embers, and whose dead blackened in
  the ashes of their hard-earned homes. Instantly we felt the help and
  strength of our organization, young and untried as it was. We were
  grateful that in this first ordeal your sympathetic president was
  with us. We were deeply grateful for your prompt call to action,
  given through her, which rallied us to our work. Our relief rooms
  were instantly secured and our white banner, with its bright scarlet
  cross, which has never been furled since that hour, was thrown to
  the breeze, telling to every looker-on what we were there to do, and
  pointing to every generous heart an outlet for its sympathy. We had
  not mistaken the spirit of our people; our scarce-opened doorway was
  filled with men, women and children bearing their gifts of pity and
  love. Tables and shelves were piled, our working committee of ladies
  took every article under inspection, their faithful hands made all
  garments whole and strong; lastly, each article received the stamp
  of the society and of the Red Cross, and all were carefully and
  quickly consigned to the firm packing cases awaiting them. Eight
  large boxes were shipped at first, others followed directly, and so
  continued until notified by the Relief Committee of Michigan that
  no more were needed. Meanwhile the hands of our treasurer were not
  left empty, some hundreds of dollars were deposited with him. A most
  competent agent, our esteemed townsman and county clerk of
  Livingston County, Major Mark J. Bunnell, was dispatched with the
  first invoice of funds and charged with the duty of the reception of
  the supplies, their proper distribution and of making direct report
  of the condition and needs of the sufferers.

  The good practical judgment of the people and society led them to
  consider the near approach of winter and the unsheltered condition
  of the victims, bereft of every earthly possession, and warm
  clothing and bedding were sent in great abundance. Our cases were
  all marked with the Red Cross and consigned to Senator Omar D.
  Conger, of Port Huron, who led the call of the Michigan committee
  and to whom, as well as to his kindhearted and practical wife, we
  are indebted for many timely suggestions and words of grateful
  appreciation.

  In a spirit of gratitude and hope we submit this partial report of
  our first work under the Red Cross, which can be but partial, as our
  rooms are still open and our work is in progress awaiting such
  further calls as may come to us. We are grateful that we are called,
  grateful that your honored President, with the acquired skill of the
  humane labors of many years in many lands, was with us to counsel
  and instruct. We are glad to have learned from this early object
  lesson the value of organized effort and the value of our own
  organization.

  We hope our report may be satisfactory to you, and that our
  beautiful little valley town, quietly nestling among the green
  slopes of the Genesee Valley, after having offered the first fruits
  of the Red Cross to its own countrymen, may always be as prompt and
  generous in any call of yours for suffering humanity.

The neighboring city of Rochester, forty miles to the north of
Dansville, hearing of the activity of its smaller neighbor in the great
disaster that was paralyzing all, desired also to unite in the work and
knowing much less even than Dansville of what the Red Cross might mean,
still desired to act with it, if possible; and appended herewith will be
found their report, which will best tell their story.

  Influential citizens of Rochester, Monroe County, N.Y., having
  become interested in the subject of the Treaty of Geneva and the Red
  Cross work going on in Dansville, sent a request through the mayor
  of the city to Miss Clara Barton to address them in a public
  meeting. Miss Barton met an audience of thinking, philanthropic men
  and women, to whom it was a pleasure to unfold her theme. The result
  was a proposition to organize a society before adjournment.
  Accordingly names were pledged, and, the second evening after, a
  constitution was adopted and officers were elected, Edward M. Moore,
  M.D., president....

  Steps were immediately taken for reducing to practice the theory of
  their newly formed society, and in three days from the commencement
  of its existence its agent, Professor J.B. Hubbell, was on the burnt
  fields of Michigan with instructions to examine into the condition
  of the people and report their necessities to the society from
  actual observation. These duties were faithfully and judiciously
  performed, and on the day following his report of the special need
  of money the sum of $2500 in cash was forwarded as a first
  installment. At last reports the sum raised amounted to $3807.28 and
  the society numbered 250 members. It is evident that no full report
  can be made concerning a movement of which only the first steps are
  taken, and which is still in active operation, but it is believed
  that the instances are rare when, with no distress of its own as an
  incentive, but from the simple motive of benevolence, a people has
  accomplished so much, both in organization and practical results, in
  so brief a space of time.

Following close on the organization in Rochester, the citizens of the
sister city of Syracuse and vicinity, in Onondaga County, N.Y., met at
the Board of Trade rooms and perfected their organization under the
above name. Rev. Dr. Richmond Fiske, a widely known philanthropist,
prominently connected with the principal charities of the city, assisted
by Professor G.F. Comfort, of the Syracuse University, led the movement.
The constitution, embracing in admirable form the principles of the
Geneva Convention, was signed by a large number present and officers
were appointed representing the names of the leading people of the city.

These were the first steps of the American National Association of the
Red Cross in relief work and in the organization of auxiliary societies.
The completion of this work, which may have seemed premature and
preliminary, left the association free to continue its efforts with the
Government of the United States on behalf of its accession to the
treaty.




MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVER FLOODS--1882.


The spring rise of the waters of the Mississippi brought great
devastation and a cry went over the country in regard to the sufferings
of the inhabitants of the Mississippi valley. For hundreds of miles the
great river was out of its bed and raging madly over the country,
sweeping in its course not only the homes but often the people, the
animals, and many times the land itself. This constituted a work of the
relief clearly within the bounds of the civil part of our treaty, and
again we prepared for work. Again our infant organization sent its field
agent, Dr. Hubbell, to the scene of disaster, where millions of acres of
the richest valley, cotton and sugar lands of America, and thousands
upon thousands of homes under the waters of the mightiest of
rivers--where the swift rising floods overtook alike man and beast in
their flight of terror, sweeping them ruthlessly to the gulf beyond, or
leaving them clinging in famishing despair to some trembling roof or
swaying tree top till relief could reach and rescue them.

The National Association, with no general fund, sent of its personal
resources what it was able to do, and so acceptable did these prove and
so convincing were the beneficences of the work that the cities of
Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans desired to be permitted to form
associate societies and work under the National Association. This was
permitted, and those societies have remained until the present time, New
Orleans organizing for the entire State of Louisiana. The city of
Rochester, proud and grateful of its success in the disaster a few
months before, again came to the front and again rendered excellent
service.

It was a singular fact that on the first day of March, 1882, while the
National Association was in session busily engaged in devising ways and
means for extending the relief which to them seemed so needed and so
slender, a messenger came from the Senate of the United States to
announce to them that the vote had been taken and that the United
States had acceded to the Treaty of Geneva without a dissenting voice.
This closed a meeting joyfully which had opened with many misgivings.
Fresh courage and hope were taken and every energy called into action
for the furtherance of the work which seemed then fairly commenced.

In the spring of 1883 occurred the first great rise of the _Ohio_ River;
1000 miles in extent. This river, although smaller than the Mississippi,
is more rapid in its course, and its valleys hold the richest grain
lands, the most cultivated farms and representing, in fact, the best
farming interests of America.

The destruction of property was even greater here than in the cotton and
cane lands of the Mississippi. Again our field agent was dispatched and
did excellent work. The entire country was aroused, and so liberal were
the contributions to the various committees of relief that when Dr.
Hubbell retired from the field, having completed the work, he had still
unexpended funds in hand. But they were soon needed.




MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA CYCLONE


In less than a month occurred the fearful cyclone of Louisiana and
Mississippi, which cut a swath clear of all standing objects for thirty
miles in width and several hundred miles in length, running southeast
from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.

Our special agent for the South, Colonel F.R. Southmayd, took charge of
the Red Cross relief in this disaster, and so efficient was his work
that societies struggled for organization under him and the Red Cross
was hailed as a benediction wherever he passed. This was in May, 1883.

Our association now enjoyed for eight months a respite from active work.
It was surely needed. It was the longest rest we had yet known, and
afforded some small opportunity to gather up its records of past labors,
organize some societies and compile a history of the Red Cross, so much
needed for the information of our people and so earnestly asked for by
them as well as by the United States Senate. From this history the
preceding pages of this book have been extracted.

               American Red Cross, 1884._]




THE OHIO RIVER FLOODS.


But the respite was all too short for our purposes. The rapidly melting
snows of February, 1884, brought the one thousand miles of the Ohio
River again out of its bed. A wild cry went out all over the country for
help. The government, through Congress, took immediate action and
appropriated several hundred thousand dollars for relief, to be applied
through the War Department. The Red Cross agents must again repair to
the field, its societies be again notified.

But its president felt that if she were to be called every year to
direct the relief work of the association in these inundations it was
incumbent upon her to visit the scene in person, to see for herself what
floods were like, to learn the necessities and be able to direct with
the wisdom born of actual knowledge of the subject; and accordingly,
with ten hours' preparation, she joined Dr. Hubbell on his way and
proceeded to Pittsburg, the head of the Ohio River. There the societies
were telegraphed that Cincinnati would be headquarters and that money
and supplies should be sent there. This done, we proceeded to Cincinnati
by rail.

Any description of this city upon our entrance would fall so far short
of the reality as to render it useless.

The surging river had climbed up the bluffs like a devouring monster and
possessed the town; large steamers could have plied along its business
streets; ordinary avocations were abandoned. Bankers and merchants stood
in its relief houses and fed the hungry populace, and men and women were
out in boats passing baskets of food to pale, trembling hands stretched
out to reach it from third story windows of the stately blocks and
warehouses of that beautiful city. Sometimes the water soaked away the
foundations and the structure fell with a crash and was lost in the
floods below; in one instance seven lives went out with the falling
building; and this was one city, and probably the best protected and
provided locality in a thousand miles of thickly populated country.

It had not been my intention to remain at the scene of disaster, but
rather to see, investigate, establish an agency and return to national
headquarters at Washington, which in the haste of departure had been
left imperfectly cared for. But I might almost say, in military
parlance, that I was "surprised and captured."

I had made no call beyond the Red Cross societies--expected no supplies
from other sources--but scarcely had news of our arrival at Cincinnati
found its way to the public press when telegrams of money and checks,
from all sides and sources, commenced to come in, with letters
announcing the sending of material. The express office and freight
depots began filling up until within two weeks we were compelled to open
large supply rooms, which were generously tendered to the use of the Red
Cross. A description could no more do justice to our flood of supplies
than to the flood of waters which had made them necessary--cases,
barrels and bales of clothing, food, household supplies, new and old;
all that intelligent awakened sympathy could suggest was there in such
profusion that, so far from thinking of leaving it one must call all
available help for its care and distribution.

The government would supply the destitute people with food, tents and
army blankets, and had placed its military boats upon the river to
rescue the people and issue rations until the first great need should be
supplied.

The work of the Red Cross is supplemental and it sought for the special
wants likely to be overlooked in this great general supply and the
necessities _outside_ the limits of governmental aid. The search was not
difficult. The government provided neither fuel nor clothing. It was but
little past midwinter. A cyclone struck the lower half of the river with
the water at its greatest height and whole villages were swept away in a
night. The inhabitants escaped in boats, naked and homeless. Hail fell
to the depth of several inches and the entire country was encased in
sleet and ice. The water had filled the coal mines so abundant in that
vicinity until no fuel could be obtained. The people were more likely to
freeze than starve and against this there was no provision.

We quickly removed our headquarters from Cincinnati to Evansville, three
hundred miles below and at the head of the recent scene of disaster. A
new staunch steamer of four hundred tons burden was immediately
chartered and laden to the water's edge with clothing and coal; good
assistants, both men and women were taken on board; the Red Cross flag
was hoisted and as night was setting in, after a day of intense
cold--amid surging waters and crashing ice, the floating wrecks of towns
and villages, great uprooted giants of the forest plunging madly to the
sea, the suddenly unhoused people wandering about the river banks, or
huddled in strange houses with fireless hearths--the clear-toned bell
and shrill whistle of the "Josh V. Throop" announced to the generous
inhabitants of a noble city that from the wharves of Evansville was
putting out the first Red Cross relief boat that ever floated on
American waters.

The destroyed villages and hamlets lay thick on either bank, and the
steamer wove its course diagonally from side to side calling the people
to the boat, finding a committee to receive and distribute, and learning
as nearly as possible the number of destitute persons, put off the
requisite quantity of clothing and coal, and steamed away quickly and
quietly leaving sometimes an astonished _few_, sometimes a _multitude_
to gaze after and wonder who she was, whence she came, what that strange
flag meant, and most of all, to thank God with tears and prayers for
what she brought.

In this manner the Red Cross proceeded to Cairo, a distance of four
hundred miles, where the Ohio joins the Mississippi River, which latter
at that time had not risen and was exciting no apprehension. Returning,
we revisited and resupplied the destitute points. The government boats
running over the same track were genial and friendly with us, and
faithful and efficient in their work.

It should be said that, notwithstanding all the material we had shipped
and distributed, so abundant had been the liberality of the people that
on our return to Evansville we found our supply greater than at any
previous time.

At this moment, and most unexpectedly, commenced the great rise of the
Mississippi River, and a _second_ cry went out to the government and the
people for instant help. The strongest levees were giving way under the
sudden pressure, and even the inundation of the city of New Orleans was
threatened. Again the government appropriated money, and the War
Department sent out its rescue and ration boats, and again the Red Cross
prepared for its supplemental work.

In an overflow of the Mississippi, owing to the level face of the
country and the immense body of water, the valley is inundated at times
thirty miles in width, thus rendering it impossible to get animals to a
place of safety. Great numbers drown and the remainder, in a prolonged
overflow, have largely starved, the government having never included the
domestic animals in its work of relief. This seemed an omission of
vital importance, both humanely and economically considered, and the Red
Cross prepared to go to the relief of the starving animals of the
Mississippi valley. It would also supply clothing to the destitute
people whom the government would feed.

The navigation of the Mississippi River calls for its own style of boats
and pilotage, the latter being both difficult and dangerous, especially
with the changed channels and yawning crevasses of a flood.

The steamer "Throop" was left at Evansville and the "Mattie Bell"
chartered at St. Louis and laden with corn, oats, hay, meal and salt for
cattle; clothing and cooking utensils for the destitute people; tea,
coffee, rice, sugar and medicines for the sick: and as quickly as
possible followed the government steamers leaving the same port with
rations of meat and meal. These latter boats kindly burdened themselves
with large quantities of our forage which _our_ overladen boat could not
contain.

We soon found that our judgment in regard to the condition of the
animals had been correct. Horses, mules, cows, sheep and pigs had been
hastily gotten upon floating rafts and platforms of logs raised above
the water, or had taken refuge, as many as could, on the narrow strips
of land, known as broken levees, say eight to twelve feet in width, just
peering above the water; and here they stood often crowded beyond the
possibility of lying down, with no morsel of food save the wee green
leaves and tips of the willow branches and gray moss which their pitying
owners, largely poor negroes, could gather in skiffs and bring to them.
Day by day they stood and wasted, starved, and their bodies floated down
the stream, food for the birds of prey hovering above. Week after week
hour after hour the mighty river, pouring through its monster crevasses,
spread wider and wider every hour. We left our steamer at times and were
rowed out in little boats for miles alongside of the levees, and went
among the cattle. Some waded out into the water to their backs to reach
after the green scum which gathered and swam delusively upon the
surface. Some, unable to stand, lay stretched at length with head and
horns dabbling in the mud, fearlessly turning great pitiful eyes upon us
as we approached. Others, reeling, followed us tamely about, as if
beseeching us to feed them. I need not add that they were fed.
Committees of both white and colored persons were formed and the
requisite quantity of food for the animals and clothing for the people
were left with these committees at every needy point. Our steamer was
reladen, or our supplies replenished at each available port, and in
this manner we passed to New Orleans, and returning, resupplied our
committees.

The necessity for a change of boat on the Ohio and Mississippi has been
mentioned; that the "Throop" was discharged at Evansville and the Red
Cross body passed over to St. Louis. Perhaps some reference to the
journals of that date would best illustrate the necessity for these
movements, as well as the spirit of the people and of the times.

From an editorial in the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_ of March 31, 1884, the
following extract is taken:

  The day is not far distant--if it has not already come--when the
  American people will recognize the Red Cross as one of the wisest
  and best systems of philanthropic work in modern times. Its mission
  is not accomplished when it has carried the generous offerings of
  the people to their brethren who have met with sudden calamity. It
  does not stop with the alleviation of bodily suffering and the
  clothing of the destitute--blessed as that work is, when wisely
  done, so as not to break down the manly spirit of self-help. The Red
  Cross has become a grand educator, embodying the best principles of
  social science, and that true spirit of charity which counts it a
  sacred privilege to serve one's fellowmen in time of trouble. The
  supplying of material wants--of food, raiment and shelter is only a
  small part of its ministry. In its work among suffering humanity,
  when fire or flood or pestilence has caused widespread desolation,
  the Red Cross seeks to carry to people's hearts that message which
  speaks of a universal brotherhood. It is all the time and everywhere
  sowing the seed of brotherly kindness and goodwill, which is
  destined in time to yield the fruits of world-wide peace. Once let
  the love of doing good unto others become deeply rooted and
  practiced as an international custom, and arsenals and ironclad
  navies will give way to the spirit of equity. War will cease as a
  relic of barbarism, and peace will shed its benedictions over all
  nations.

From the Evansville _Journal_ of April 3, the following:

  The president of the Red Cross left for St. Louis last night, where
  she will take charge of a steamer which has been chartered under her
  direction for relief service in the lower Mississippi.... The
  mission of the Red Cross, which has done such wonderful and
  effective work in the Ohio valley, is not yet completed. The lower
  Mississippi cries for aid. The destruction of property below the
  mouth of the Ohio is, if possible, greater than was experienced on
  the Ohio. Life has not been in such desperate peril, but property
  has been swept away by oceans of water, and the landowner, with corn
  and cotton fields, has been reduced to pauperism.... This year the
  overflow has been of such a character that neither crop, mortgage,
  nor advance are safe, and the renter and half-share farmer must
  suffer. The Red Cross comes to the rescue. Miss Barton will be
  accompanied by several ladies from this city and will be joined by
  many gentlemen and ladies from St. Louis.

From the St. Louis _Democrat_, April 4, the following:

  Miss Clara Barton arrived at the "Southern" yesterday morning. Miss
  Barton is accompanied by Mrs. De Bruler and Miss Enola Lee, of
  Evansville, Ind., Dr. J. B. Hubbell, field agent, and Mr. John Hitz,
  of Washington, D.C. The members of the party were busily engaged
  yesterday in superintending the loading of the steamer "Mattie
  Bell," which leaves for the inundated districts of the lower
  Mississippi this morning. Miss Octavia Dix, secretary of the St.
  Louis branch of the Red Cross, will accompany the expedition.

The brave men of the Fifth Corps in the Cuban War of 1898, endured
hunger and thirst and other conditions better remembered than described.
Some of them partook of the gracious offerings of hot gruel, malted
milk, boiled rice, apple wine, and prune cordial at the hands of Mrs.
Dr. Gardner. It will perhaps interest them to know that she is the same
who, as Miss Enola Lee, was one of the company of the "Mattie Bell" in
1884.

Some of the men of the War of 1861 may remember the officer who had
charge of the Commissary Department at Washington. I shall never forget
the man who, despite all rank and position, stood many an hour of many a
day beside my army wagons loading at his headquarters, and who wisely
directed the selection of material best suited to and most needed at the
proposed terminus of the dark and weary journey I was about to
undertake--it was then Colonel, now General Beckwith of the regular
army. He was in 1884, holding the position of Commissary at St. Louis.
In the same old time spirit and in the old time way he came upon the
deck of our little steamer, and directed the placing of the supplies of
the "Mattie Bell." One will never forget the terror depicted on his fine
face when he saw the bales of hay taken on board. "Great heavens, you
are not going to risk that! Think of it--you in the middle of that
great, rushing river, no land in sight, and your ship on fire!" Still,
the risk was taken, and both the ship and the stock were saved.

A few hours previous to the sailing of the "Mattie Bell" from St. Louis
a stranger came on board and asked to be permitted to go with us. There
was nothing very remarkable in his appearance, either for or against;
but on general principles we objected to taking on a stranger without
some good reason for it. His quiet persistence, however, won, and
perhaps through lack of active measures on the part of some one he went.
He was a silent man--walked by himself, or stood alone on some
unfrequented corner of the deck. As we got lower down and more
tributaries were pouring their contributions into the mighty volume that
rolled and seethed about and beneath us, the danger became more
imminent. Running after dark was out of the question, and timely orders
were given one afternoon to tie up for the night; but our captain,
anxious to make a headland a few miles further on, begged permission to
run a little later, sure he could reach it before dark.

His request was rather reluctantly granted, and as we steamed on a fog
and mist came up and night set in with us still afloat. In less than a
half hour the stranger rushed to me with: "We are in a crevasse! We must
pull out or we are lost! I have warned the engineer and captain." The
forward rush of the boat ceased; she stood still, pulled first one way
then the other, shivered and struggled amid the shrieks of the reversed
engine, while we waited, thoroughly aware of the situation and the doom
awaiting us all, depending on the power and strength of one mute body of
steel and one firm man at the helm. At length the struggling ceased; the
engines had triumphed over the current. We commenced to move slowly
backward, and with a grateful awe in our hearts that no words could
express we found a place of safety for the night.

Daylight revealed to us a crevasse opened the day before where the river
had broken through to a width of thirty rods, with the water pouring
down a depth of twelve or fifteen feet in a perfect torrent into the
current below, and rolling off in a self-made track to some other stream
or to the Gulf of Mexico.

I have no way of accounting for this incident, but the reader will
perhaps not be "too hard" on me, if I say with the father of "Little
Breeches," "I have believed in God and the angels ever since one night
last spring."


DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI.

Down the Mississippi all was changed. Two worlds could scarcely differ
more. The ofttimes shoreless waste of waters; the roaring crevasse
through the broken levees; the anxious ebony faces and the hungry
animals that "looked up and were not fed," among whom and which we
floated, could not fail to carry our thoughts back at times to the
history of the Deluge and the Ark. The simile, however, had this
important difference; we were by no means so good as to be preserved,
nor they so bad as to be destroyed.

Any bare description of this voyage constitutes only the woody framework
of the structure. You will readily imagine that, when it should be
clothed with its ever recurring incidents it would become a very
different edifice. Never a day that did not bring us incidents to be
remembered, sometimes sad and touching, sometimes laughable or
ridiculous.

The rough, tattered and uncouth garb of the Ohio River farmer and
woodsman was offset by his quick wit and sterling sense, and the rude
dialect of the Southern negro was buried out of sight by his simple
faith. But the most touching of all was the honest gratitude which
poured out on every side.

These people adopted the Red Cross and those who bore it, and we, in
turn, have held to them. We selected helpers from among them, banded
them together, gave them responsibility and thus made them mutual helps
to each other and to us as well, in case of subsequent disaster.

One day as we were near the left bank of the river we saw a small herd
of cattle wading out far into the water for what they could reach. A few
cabins stood back of them. Steaming as near as we could we made fast to
the body of a small fig tree and called the negroes, men and women, to
us in their skiff.

It proved to be a little neighborhood of negroes with no white "boss,"
as they say, but had their own mules and cows and were farming
independently. But the food and feed were gone. The government boats had
passed without seeing them, and no help had come to them. Their mules
and cows were starving; they had no one to apply to. They had their
little church; and their elder, a good, honest-faced man, who led them
onto the boat, told the story of their sufferings and danger. We
selected two men and two women, formed them into a committee of
distribution and wrote out formal directions and authority for them. But
before presenting it to them to sign, I asked them seriously if we left
these supplies with them if they thought they could share them honestly
with each other and not quarrel over them.

They were silent a moment. Then the tallest of the women rose up, and
with commanding gesture said: "Miss, dese tings is from de Lord; dey is
not from you, caze you is from Him. He sent you to bring dem. We would
not dare to quarrel ober dem things; we would not dare not to be honest
wid 'em."

I presented the paper with no further pledge. It was signed with one
name and three marks. The supplies were put off on the only little spot
of land that could be reached. The negroes left the boat and stood
beside the pile, which seemed a little mountain in the level space of
waters. We raised steam and prepared to put off, expecting as we did so
some demonstration, some shout of farewell from our newfound friends on
shore and held our handkerchiefs ready to wave in reply--not a
sound--and as we "rounded to" and looked back, the entire group had
knelt beside the bags of grain and food and not a head or hand was
raised to bid us speed. A Greater than we had possessed them, and in
tearful silence we bowed our heads as well and went our way.

After the first rush of danger was over and repairs commenced among the
business men, it was not always easy to find faithful willing agents to
distribute supplies among those who had nothing left to repair but their
stomachs, and no material for this.

At Point Coupee the Mississippi sends out a false branch of thirty miles
in length, forming an island, and again joining the main river at
Hermitage. These are known as False River and Island. The government
boats had not entered False River, and there was great want among both
people and cattle.

All the way down we were besought to hold something back for this point.
At Hermitage we found the one business man, owner of the boat which
plied the thirty miles of river, its warehouse and all. He, of course,
was the only man who could take charge of and distribute relief around
the island; and Captain Trudeau was sought. He was a young, active man,
full of business, just pulling out of his own disaster, and did not know
how to attend to it. "Guessed the trouble was most over up there; hadn't
heard much about it lately." We knew better and felt discouraged that
persons could not be found of sufficient humanity to distribute relief
when brought to them.

I was sitting heart sore and perplexed in my stateroom trying to think
out a way when two rather young women of prepossessing appearance
entered with a bouquet of early flowers for me, introducing themselves
as Mrs. and Miss Trudeau, wife and sister of the captain. I scarcely
felt gracious, but those fair womanly faces were strong to win, and I
entered into conversation asking Mrs. Trudeau what she thought of the
condition of the people of the island. Her face grew sad as she said in
touching tones, "Indeed, I cannot say, Miss Barton; my husband's boat
runs around twice a week and I tried to go on it for a while, but the
sight of such destitution and those starving cattle, mules, cows, horses
and sheep were beyond my endurance. I had nothing to give them, and I
could not see it, and so left off going."

"Would you ladies take the agency of the Red Cross to deliver supplies
to these people?"

I shall not forget the appropriate and womanly manner in which this
delicate lady received the abrupt proposition--no hesitation, no
surprise, no self-depreciation, no simpering, but the straightforward
reply, "We would, most willingly and gladly, and do our best. Our
warehouse could store them, our boat take and we distribute them." The
customary official document was at once drawn up and signed.

An hour later the busy captain rushed in to see how much was really
expected of him.

"Captain," I said, "I have found agents to distribute our relief, and
very satisfactorily, I think, and shall be able to release you from all
responsibility." His fine face fell; he had not expected this and in
spite of all did not relish being quite relieved from duty. I went on:
"You will have some share in it, captain. For instance, you will supply
storage in your warehouse; your boat will take supplies on any day when
demanded. Your men will handle and load all material. You will, in
short, provide all accommodations, do all the work, meet all the cost,
obey orders implicitly, but have none of the credit! Mrs. and Miss
Trudeau are my agents."

The good fellow fairly threw up his hat. "Good! That's just what I'm
used to. It shall be done." And it was done; but how well it was done I
could not describe to you--not only wisely and well, but elegantly.

The captain's warehouse had little empty space after our cargo of
supplies had gone into it The next day but one would be the day
appointed for Governor McEnnery, of Louisiana, to make at Point Coupee
his re-election speech, which would call all the people of the island
who could reach it to that point to see and hear the popular governor.
The little steamer "Governor Wiltz" was laden with supplies, and under
direction of Madame Trudeau proceeded to Point Coupee in order to meet
the people, learn the needs, and inform everyone that supplies and
relief were at hand. The gallant governor addressed the crowd from the
deck of the "Governor Wiltz" under the Red Cross flag, and took passage
on her down the river.

We resupplied these agents on our return. We did this all the way among
both white and black. And from that time the Red Cross has had faithful,
willing agents along all the uncertain track of the lower Mississippi.

Months later, in January, 1885, when a sea voyage, foreign travel, the
cares of an international conference of military men, the splendor of
foreign courts, much of weariness and illness had passed between, and I
had thought all those little days of river work gone from memory, I
found myself in the upper gallery of the New Orleans Exposition, and
stepping in at a restaurant at the end of the hall was met by Colonel
Lewis, the noted colored caterer of the South. He had been on the relief
committee of New Orleans appointed to meet our steamer at the time of
our visit in May.

He came with cordial recognition, seated me and was telling me of his
success in the restaurant when all his waiters, men and women, seemed to
forget their work and stood gazing at us. The colonel smiled and said,
"They have caught sight of the Red Cross brooch at your neck and
recognize you by it. They will come to themselves in a few minutes."

Next day I went in again for my lunch, when Colonel Lewis brought to me
a little, thin, white-haired mulatto man of seventy-three years, but
still able to take charge of and direct the help at the tables, saying,
"This, Miss Barton, is Uncle Amos, whom I promised yesterday to
introduce to you when you came again. Uncle Amos is my most true and
faithful man." I reached out for the withered, hard, dark bony hand he
gave me as he said: "Yes, Miss Barton, I wants to see and speak to you,
to tell you in de name of our people how grateful dey is for what your
society has done for dem. Dat is never forgot. You come to us when we
had nothing. You saved what was never saved befo' in a flood, our
cattle, so dey could go on and help derselves to raise something to eat.
Dey has all heard of it; all talk about it in de churches and de
meetings. Our people is singular in some tings; dey never forgets a
kindness. Dey hab notions. Dey hab a way of nailing up a hoss-shoe ober
de do' for luck. I want to tell you dat in a thousand little cabins all
up and down dis river dey has put up a little Red Cross ober de do' and
every night before dey goes to bed dey names your name and prays God to
bless you and de Red Cross dat He sent to dem in time of trouble and
distress." Uncle Amos looked straight in my face the while. Colonel
Lewis wiped his eyes, and I got away as fast as I could.

It would scarcely be faithful to the subject of this relief if some
mention were not made of the third trip, namely, that of the voyage up
the Ohio after the fall of the waters and the attempted return of the
people to their former homes.

From an editorial of the Evansville _Journal_, May 28, 1884, headed
"Good By Red Cross," we make an extract or two which has reference to
the voyage and its purposes:

  The Red Cross, having concluded its labors on the Ohio River below
  this point, will start to-day for the upper Ohio and go as far as
  Pittsburg, relieving the meritorious cases on the way.... The "Josh
  V. Throop," which has been rechartered for this trip, was loaded
  last Saturday. A part of the load was distributed between this point
  and Cave-in-Rock, and the room made vacant by the lower river
  distribution was filled with additional stores yesterday which will
  be distributed up the river. The load consists of what the people in
  the overflowed country will want and most need. There is clothing in
  immense quantities, over a hundred plows, large quantities of rakes,
  hoes, scythes, spades, shovels, groceries, flour, meat, meal, corn,
  bedsteads, chairs, buckets, tubs, tables, queensware, tinware, pots,
  kettles, skillets, etc.

  This trip was arranged in general at Cincinnati, when Miss Barton
  first came West. At that time her policy took definite shape and it
  has never changed. She saw that the government was providing for all
  the immediate necessities of the sufferers and looked forward to the
  time when the unfortunate people would come almost hopelessly back
  to ruined homes--come back to find houses, furniture, tools, food,
  everything gone--and although aid would have been extended during
  the calamity by the government and benevolent institutions, the
  ruined people would have but a poor chance to proceed in the
  business of life. This was the anticipated opportunity of the Red
  Cross; this was the time Miss Barton foresaw would be pregnant with
  possibilities for doing large good, and the event has fully
  justified her prophetic view of the situation. The load now on the
  "Throop" will not only provide for the house, it will do much for
  the farm.

It would be difficult to imagine a voyage more replete with live
interest than this beautiful May passage from Evansville to Pittsburg.

The banks were dotted with the marks of torn and washed-out homes; and
occasionally one found the family, from father and mother to the wee
little ones, gathered about the bare spot that once was home, trying in
vain to find enough of the buried timbers to recommence a framework for
another house, if ever they could build it, with all the hunger and need
for daily food staring them in the face.

Picture, if possible, this scene: A strange ship, with two flags,
steaming up the river; it halts, turns from its course, and draws up to
the nearest landing. Some persons disembark and speak a few minutes
with the family; then a half dozen strong mechanics man a small boat
laden with all material for constructing a one-room house, take it to
the spot and commence putting it up. Directly here is a structure with
floor, roof, doors, windows and walls; the boat returns for furniture.
Within three hours the strange ship sails away leaving a bewildered
family in a new and clean house, with a bed, bedding, table, chairs,
clothing, dishes, candles, a well-made little cooking stove, with
blazing fire, with all the common quota of cooking utensils, meat, meal,
groceries, a plow, rake, axe, hoe, shovel, spade, hammer, hatchet and
nails, etc. We ask few questions, they none; but often it proves that
the little, bare, boyhood feet of that desolated father had once skipped
through the dewy grass of the green hills of New England, the brave old
parent of States, where great riches are slow to come, and famishing
hunger never enters.

Again, referring to the Evansville _Journal_ of May 28 we find the
following:

  A band of little folks in Chicago, called the "Busy Bees," were
  organized in a plan to extend succor to the suffering and collected
  a large box of goods which they sent to Miss Barton, with the
  request that it might be put where it would do the most good. She
  was some time in finding a place where she could put it with the
  greatest satisfaction to the givers and the donees. She found the
  opportunity she had been looking for yesterday. On her last voyage a
  gentleman at Cave-in-Rock told her that a poor, but worthy, family
  was in that vicinity, and on becoming acquainted with the family
  Miss Barton gave them some supplies and left fifteen dollars with
  the gentleman aforesaid, to either give to the family or spend for
  them as he might think best. He concluded that it would be
  judiciously expended by the people for whom it was intended and
  accordingly turned it over to them. The woman of the family came
  some days afterward to the gentleman, bringing with her another
  woman who was very destitute, and said: "This is my neighbor, and I
  have come to ask you if you think Miss Barton would care if I
  divided my fifteen dollars with her." "Most certainly not," was the
  reply; and then, out of her penury did this poor woman give. She
  retained ten dollars and gave five. Yesterday Miss Barton divided
  the contents of the store the "Busy Bees" had gathered among these
  two families, consisting of eight and five persons respectively.
  When she was delivering the goods to the poor woman who had
  generously shared with her neighbor, Miss Barton gave her back her
  five dollars, and said: "You have read where it is said, _He that
  giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord_, and He has sent it back
  already."

On February 11, 1884, Congress, in response to appeals from Ohio,
Kentucky and West Virginia, appropriated $300,000 for the relief of the
people who had lost their homes and other property by the Ohio River
floods. On February 15, the first appropriation having been considered
hardly sufficient to meet the demands, $200,000 more were appropriated
for the same purpose, making $500,000 in all to be expended under the
direction of the War Department. A boat load of supplies was sent down
the river from Pittsburg; two boats left Cincinnati, one going up the
river and the other down; one boat went down the river from Louisville
and a fifth boat was sent down the river from Evansville. Afterward some
additional boats were sent out from other places. Between February 15
and March 15, 536,000 rations were distributed by the government at a
cost of $350,000. The remaining $150,000 were transferred to the
Mississippi flood relief.

In the official report of the relief furnished to the Ohio River flood
sufferers, written by R.P.M. Ames, Assistant Surgeon U.S. Marine
Hospital Service, Evansville, Ind., he speaks as follows of the part
taken by the Red Cross in this work:

  At this time also the Red Cross Association came actively to the
  front for now had the time arrived when this association, of all
  others, could do the most good.... Through its instrumentality much
  suffering and destitution has been relieved throughout the Ohio
  valley which it would have been almost impossible to reach but for
  this organization. With Miss Clara Barton at the head, and a large
  corps of active and intelligent assistants, the relief work
  performed by this association has been most thorough and
  efficacious. Contributions of money and clothing have been sent to
  all points in the inundated districts of the Ohio valley where such
  assistance was needed, while a thorough and careful investigation by
  members of the association of the flooded territory has rendered the
  aid most beneficial. As soon as it became apparent that the
  suffering from the high water would necessitate the various relief
  movements, Miss Barton removed her headquarters from Washington,
  D.C., to Cincinnati, O., where she carefully and intelligently
  superintended the distribution of a large amount of supplies donated
  from all parts of the country, consisting of money, food, clothing
  and fuel. As the water receded then came the time for the relief
  proffered by this association to be given.

  After remaining several days in Cincinnati and relieving all the
  suffering so far as it was met with, Miss Barton, on March 3,
  removed her headquarters to Evansville, Ind., where arrangements
  were at once commenced to reach and aid the sufferers between this
  point and Cairo, Ill. Captain J.V. Throop kindly placed his steamer,
  the "Josh V. Throop," at the disposal of the Red Cross without any
  expense except the actual running cost of the boat. The steamer was
  at once loaded with an immense quantity of boxes, barrels, bales and
  bundles of clothing, being donations from various private parties
  and relief organizations throughout the country which had been
  accumulating here for some time, together with a large amount of
  bedding and fuel, and started on its mission of mercy down the river
  in charge of Miss Clara Barton, Saturday, March 8, 1884.

  Miss Barton was accompanied and assisted on this trip by Dr. J.B.
  Hubbell, of Washington, D. C, the field agent of the association;
  Rev. E.J. Galvin, agent of the Chicago Red Cross Association; Miss
  Hamilton, of St. Louis, with Mrs. De Bruler and several other
  Evansville ladies. Relief was given to all the sufferers needing it
  below Evansville and Wickliff, Ky., below Cairo. The party reached
  Cairo March 15, and after proceeding down the river to Wickliff,
  Ky., turned back, arriving at Evansville March 20. In addition to
  the supplies mentioned, the Rev. E.J. Galvin, of Chicago, had placed
  at his disposal $25,000, from which checks were drawn and left with
  any party needing financial assistance. Miss Barton and her corps of
  assistants remained in Evansville after their return until April 2,
  when the relief transactions throughout the Ohio valley having been
  practically finished, she removed her headquarters to St. Louis,
  Mo., where a relief boat was at once fitted out and similar
  assistance tendered to the sufferers in the inundated districts of
  the lower Mississippi. Miss Barton was further aided on this trip by
  Mr. John Hitz, of Washington, D.C.

On May 25th Miss Barton made a second trip down the Ohio with the
steamer "Josh V. Throop" under charter with household supplies and
farming implements for the recent sufferers. The boat went as far as
Elizabethtown, or possibly a few miles below, and then turning back,
proceeded up stream to Wheeling or Pittsburgh till the supplies were
exhausted.


"THE LITTLE SIX."

It is possible that some readers may recall the story of the "Little
Six," which was locally published at the time, but which I venture to
reproduce, as an extract from the Erie _Dispatch_, of Monday March 24,
1884:

  _Dispatch_ readers doubtless recollect its account some weeks ago of
  the manner in which six children of Waterford gave a public
  entertainment for the benefit of the Ohio flood sufferers; how they
  themselves suggested it; how their efforts were crowned with
  success; and how they brought the entire proceeds, $51.25, raised by
  their unpaid efforts, to the editor of the _Dispatch_ with the
  request that the latter forward it "where it would do the most
  good." The _Dispatch_ complied by forwarding it to Miss Clara
  Barton, president of the American Red Cross Association. The
