while he pried.

What message?

Miss Dawson wanted something.

What did she want?

To know whether he had ordered some printed labels. Again that panic
of guilt, reassured now because she could answer his question without
stumbling. She almost wanted to call his attention to it, to say, Look,
Iâ€™m telling the truth; thereâ€™s no necessity for me to invent.

So you went up to his room?

Yes.

And you saw the spices?

Yesâ€”I was just saying, wasnâ€™t I? that it was funny you should choose
that bit to read aloud.

I expect he showed them to youâ€”heâ€™s always talking about them to meâ€”did
he?

One or twoâ€”yes, he did show me. But I couldnâ€™t stop. I had my work
waiting. She regretted ardently that she had introduced the subject;
she not only feared and mistrusted Silasâ€™s inquisition, but she also
shrank, as with physical pain, at his handling of it. He was rough and
defamatory.

His tone changed, and unexpectedly he continued in a gentle, interested,
and sympathetic voice.

Iâ€™m glad to think you make friends with Linnet. I often think itâ€™s hard
for you, living between me and Gregory; youâ€™re a young thing, soâ€™s
Linnet; itâ€™s natural you should be drawn together. Heâ€™s got a brain,
too; none of your young fools! Iâ€™ve a grand opinion of him. I thought
when he first came to the house that you and he would get laughing
together. Tell me what he looks like?

What he looks like, Silas?

Yes, describe him to me.

He has short curly hair and always laughing eyes.

Anything else?

Oh, he looks younger than his age.

How old would you think him?

Oh, about twenty-two, twenty-three.

How old are you, Nan?

Twenty-one.

And heâ€™s twenty-five. It sounds good. Iâ€™m fifty. What more about
Linnet?

I havenâ€™t looked at him so closely, Silas.

You mean you havenâ€™t noticed anything more?

No, nothing more. She had no shame, but rather pride, in the lie.

If I had eyes, I should make better use of them, said Silas, not
disagreeably. He went on, Iâ€™ve helped you and Linnet, havenâ€™t I? sent
you for walks together, left you alone in my kitchen more than once? Iâ€™m
less soured than you think me. Iâ€™m sorry for you sometimes, being young,
and I liked helping you to Linnet as a playfellow. You reckon on me,
little Nan.

She did not know what to make of this. She wanted to believe that Silas
meant to be kind; indeed, in spite of her latent scepticism she was
touched; but she was alarmed by and resisted the insinuations of his
words, which he had spoken in a lower voice, as though in an unnecessary
precaution of secrecy before Gregory; she glanced at Gregory, poising
his beautifully sharpened pencil over his drawing, and his fine looks,
and coarse rough hair, appeared to her distasteful. She looked at Silas,
so similar in build and feature, yet with a certain slyness that was
wholly absent from his brother. Silas was speaking again,â€”

If you need anything, come to me, little Nan. Youâ€™re good to me, and
itâ€™s not forgotten. Weâ€™ll be allies.

This was the kind of phrase that frightened her, and whirled her away
before she was well aware, to a region of tacit admissions and
implications. Had she said more than she meant? more than she even
thought? Why, she thought nothing, or had thought nothing until Silas
began, but now her sense of undefined well-being was taking shape,
emerging from the mist of rustle and cadence, as the coast-line of
undiscovered country emerges from the sea mists of dawn. She had been
rushed; Silas had rushed her. She thought with terror of how Silas had
fastened upon her first words; one could believe that he had only been
waiting for her to pronounce them. He had been so ready. He had fired so
many questions. He had obliged her to say, or at least to admit, by her
silence, anything he wanted. He might not want much yet, but later?
later?

Apparently he was satisfied for the moment, for he picked up his Braille
volume and fell to running his finger tips over the pages, smiling to
himself.

She hoped that the subject would be forgotten. It was not forgotten.
That was clear to her, although Silas made no direct allusion; but by
his manner he established the existence of a secret between them, and
because she dared not say to him, There is no secret, the secret
remained, growing insidiously. She was nervous and uneasy in his
presence. Silas was kinder than ever she had known him, kinder and
gentler, also he appeared to be more contented, but she had a terrified
suspicion that he was contented only because his mind was occupied, and
it seemed horrible to her that she should be the centre of that
occupation. She had suddenly become involved in an affair whose
existence, she protested to herself, had its being solely as the outcome
of Silasâ€™s imagination. She tried to shake it off and to laugh it away,
but he held her to it. She had the helpless sensation of being on the
end of a rope that he was slowly hauling in, maintaining his purchase
over every miserly inch as he gained it.

Hambley, soft-footed, insinuating, and urbane, added by his parasitic
presence to the uneasiness of the house. The yellow faced, thin little
man, with his black hair and his long front teeth like a rodentâ€™s, never
had an opinion of his own, but echoed Silas, or cackled with the
laughter of approval. He alternately tried to provoke and to propitiate
Nan and Morgan, gibed at them when they were civil to him, and fawned on
them when they were curt. Nan shuddered when she wondered how many of
Silasâ€™s darker thoughts were shared out to his keeping.

Was there a conspiracy against her? To her mind, full of alarm, this
seemed not impossible. Calthorpe even,â€”her prop, her kind, comfortable
friend,â€”Calthorpe mentioned casually, I may have to steal Gregory from
you, my dear; I must have a man with me when I go to Birmingham to look
over some new plants, and I fancy that your Gregory would relish the
job, and be very useful to me. She had clasped his arm. Oh no, donâ€™t
take Gregory away, Mr. Calthorpe. What! he said in surprise, are you
so fond of him? She did not answer. She was not fond of Gregory; he was
an owner and an institution, but the question of fondness played no
part. Hitherto, she had not thought of disliking him; that was all. He
and Silas (until she knew Silas was a murderer) had appeared very much
the same in her mind, the only difference being that whereas Gregory had
rights over her passive and uninquiring person Silas had none.

Well, am I not to take him? asked Calthorpe.

Yes, take him, she replied. Why had she hesitated? By all these doubts
and hesitations she was playing Silasâ€™s game; he had gained another inch
of the rope. When are you going?

Itâ€™s all quite uncertain; I may not be going at all. But if I go, it
will be some time next month, and I shall ask for Gregory. I am
discovering that he has the real knack for any kind of engine; heâ€™s
sulky about it and contemptuous, but I urge him, and he unfolds. He
showed me some of his plansâ€”but youâ€™re in the clouds?


                                   II

Silas was with Lady Malleson, more than usually morose. She lay upon the
sofa, while he prowled up and down the room.

Dene, you scarcely speak to me to-day?

(She cringes, he thought with pride.)

My sister-in-lawâ€™s in love, he replied tersely.

With whom has she fallen in love? asked Lady Malleson, thinking how
strange it was that she should be thus intimately conversant with a
group of work-people down in the village.

With Morgan,â€”the young zany.

Why, you always seemed so fond of him! your one human frailty, she
bantered. But he rounded on her with unwarrantable sharpness. I think
your ladyship is mistaken: I never remember saying I was fond of Morgan.
Theyâ€™re neither of them any more alive than a turtle-dove sunning itself
in a wicker cage.

You strange creatureâ€”have you _no_ natural affections? she said, with
indolent curiosity. None for that young man, who really devotes himself
to you? none for your little harmless sister-in-law?

Iâ€™m nothing to themâ€”only a blind man to whom theyâ€™re kind out of their
charity.

I donâ€™t believe, Silas, that you are so bleak as you make out.

My own solitude, my lady, is my own choosing.

Why shouldnâ€™t you accept what comfort those two young things could give
you?

Itâ€™s weak, he burst out, why not stand alone? why depend on another?
Why shouldnâ€™t the strength of one suffice? Why all this need to double
it? Loveâ€™s wholly a question of weakness; the weaker you are, the more
desperately you love. A prop.... Loveâ€™s the first tie for an independent
man to rid himself of. Itâ€™s a weakness that grows too easily out of all
proportion. I want my mind for other things, not for anything so trite.
So well charted. So ... so recurrent.

Another theory, Silas? Be careful, she lazily teased him; what we
most abuse, you know, is often what we most fear.

I shall break them, he growled.

What! your sister-in-law? that frail-looking little thing?

She, and ... her lover.

Silas, you scare me sometimes, you speak so savagely.

Scare you, my lady? even you?

Why â€˜even meâ€™?

Youâ€™ve explored me, he said grudgingly; you know me so well.

Do I? everything about you?

Not quite, he said, in a tone of profound gloom.

Do you know yourself, I wonder?

To the depths, he replied.

Do you enjoy having such complete self-knowledge?

Itâ€™s lonely, he said, his face drawn.

Lonely, but you have _me_ now to talk to.

Oh, your ladyship is very kind and gracious, he said, with the
deferential manner he sometimes abruptly assumed, and through which she
always uncomfortably suspected the sarcasm; I am very grateful to your
ladyship. But your ladyship.... and thus far he preserved his
deference, but abandoned it now to exclaim as though tormented, Youâ€™re
a whetstone to my disquiet; you taunt me, you keep all peace from me.

I never knew you wanted peace.

He was tired and dispirited that day, and had been dwelling upon his
blindness; he craved for peace, for some one to give him peace!â€”and she
knew it. But she must whip and provoke him back to the strain of his old
attitude. She did not know what urged her to say as she did, in her most
sneering tone, I never knew you wanted peace.

Nor I do, he snarled; I wouldnâ€™t have it as a gift.


                                  III

So they wrangled always; indispensable she might be to him, but peace
was certainly not what she brought him. And although they maintained the
disguise afforded by her tone of slight condescension, and by his of
conventional respect, underneath this disguise fomented the perpetual
and manifold contest, of class against class, of the rough against the
fastidious, of the man against the woman. She had very little real fear
that its full strength would ever break over her,â€”little real fear, only
enough to provide the spice she exacted. She trusted to her appraisement
of him: too proud to risk a rebuff; too fiercely recalcitrant under the
thongs of affection. Under their menace he snorted and reared, while she
laughed indolently, and incited him to further indignations. Yet she
held him, she held him! and though she knew full well that she fretted
and exasperated him, she held him still; seeing his struggles, but
toying with him, pretending to let him go, pulling him back, distracting
and confusing his spirit that was always beating round in the search for
escape; and all the while she heard from various quarters the pleasant
flattery of her guilt extolled under the name of charity.


                                   IV

Youâ€™ll be happy soon: youâ€™ll have the spring, Silas said to Nan. He
did not speak with the customary note of derision in his voice,â€”this was
the newer Silas,â€”but she thought she detected it very painstakingly
concealed.

She went away from him, and her going was after the manner of a flight.
Had she followed her impulse, she would have gone running, with her head
bent down between her protecting hands. It seemed that she could keep
nothing from Silas; he laid his grasp without mercy upon her shyest
secrets. She had tried to keep her joy in the coming spring a secret;
although reserve was hard of accomplishment to her, she had achieved it,
hiding her delight away in her heart, or so she believed, not knowing
that her laughter had rung more clearly, or that she had been singing so
constantly over her work in the two cottages. She was conscious of no
impatience and no desires. She would not, by a wish, have made herself a
month older. She was happy now, she told herself, because the country
would presently become a refuge from the factory, instead of its dismal
and consonant setting, wide and level as the sea itself, in its centre
the sinister hump of the abbey and the factory. By walking a little way
in the opposite direction, and turning her back upon the village, she
would dismiss the factory and look across the liberated country, as it
was impossible to do in these days when the floods accompanied the
factory for miles around as a reflection of its spirit. She told herself
that she wanted nothing more. She knew that she could be happy,â€”perhaps
not indefinitely, but she did not look far ahead, the present was too
buoyant and suspended,â€”happy for the moment if Silas would but leave her
alone.


                                   V

For a few days he kept up his new smooth-spoken tone; it was little
Nan this, and little Nan that, and whenever he could get hold of her
hand he stroked and patted it, and joined his fingers round her wrist,
saying that it was fragile. Youâ€™re very slight, Nan, he said, feeling
her arm and shoulder, and once he laid one hand against her chest and
the other against her back, and said that there was no thickness in her
body. She withdrew herself, shuddering, from his touch. Iâ€™m blind, you
know, he whined, and then laughed, Bless you, blind or not blind, I
know any of you in the room before youâ€™ve spoken; thereâ€™s very little
Silas doesnâ€™t know. I know all about you, Nan, and Iâ€™m a good friend to
you, too. But Silas ... she began desperately. Hush! he said,
putting his fingers to her lips and looking mysterious, no need to say
anything; we understand one another. Just then Linnet Morgan came in,
throwing aside his cap, and Nan clasped her hands in terror lest Silas
should continue. Linnet? said Silas instantly, youâ€™re back early
to-day.

Linnet had work which could as easily be done at home. He began at once
getting books and papers out of his cupboard, and disposing them on the
table. He and Nan observed one another stealthily and quickly; he saw
that she wore her dark red shirt and black skirt, and that on his
entrance she had become silent as though confused, but meanwhile he
talked to Silas and made him laugh, and ran his fingers backwards
through his hair. Nan noticed that his crisp hair was quite golden at
the roots, and that a fine white line followed the beginning of its
growth. He was very fair-skinned, and the back of his neck where it
disappeared into his collar was covered with a fine golden down. He was
always busy; when he was not working he was talking and laughing; Nan
supposed that he had never in his life had time to think about himself.

Thereâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always wanted to know, began Silas, resting his
arms upon the table as though he were watching Nan and Linnet, what
were you two doing here the night Martin came? while I was at the
Abbey?

The night the donkey was maimed? asked Morgan.

Why, fancy you remembering that! said Silas negligently.

I was clearing up, and we talked for a bit, Nan put in.

There was nothing to clear up; it was Sunday evening and youâ€™d been
singing and playing your zither. You talked mostly,â€”now, didnâ€™t you?

Why not? asked Morgan. He was very rarely sharp in speech, but he saw
Nanâ€™s discomfort.

Why not, indeed? you and Nan are much of an age, Silas replied. They
considered him wonderingly; was he well-intentioned or infinitely
malign? As they considered him he got up and went towards the stairs.
Back in a moment, he said. They heard his tread upon the steps, then
moving overhead. They looked at one another.

Why did you say that about the donkey? Nan asked.

You think, like me, that Silas did it, he answered, as a statement.
Donâ€™t look so frightened, he went on, his eyes softening into his
ready smile; I assure you, you need never be frightened of Silas.
Thereâ€™s no muscle in his violence. Nothing will ever come of itâ€”beyond
maiming donkeys. Oh yes, itâ€™s horrible, I know, because itâ€™s so futile.
No, donâ€™t shake your headâ€”your pretty head, he added inaudibly. An
impulse came over him to cry You tiny thing! you slip of fragility!
but he repressed it.

She uttered the most treacherous remark she had ever breathed about
Silas, something which fringed the frightful truth, I know better,
then terrified of her indiscretion, added, Oh no, I mean nothing.

You are afraid of him, arenâ€™t you? he said, coming round the table
closer to her, his attitude very sympathetic and protective, and
differing by a shade from Calthorpeâ€™s attitude. You must not be that.
One can only be sorry for Silas, who has grown warped and crooked, and
who talks because there is nothing else he can do. Whenever I think of
Silas, I feel so lucky in mind and body.

She glanced at him gratefully. He had had the tact not to urge an
explanation of her injudicious remark, and she knew that she could
always depend upon this gentle tact; moreover, he had rescued her soul
from the terror she so dreaded, and had by his words set Silas in a sane
and pitiful light. It suited her temperament to have Silas drawn down
from the uncomfortable heights where he seemed to dwell in perpetual
strife with elements. It was no longer Silas who brooded over them, but
they who endured and even loved Silas with widened charity. She was very
grateful to Linnet for this. What he had done once he could do again; he
could soothe her terrors. She had not yet thought of him in so human,
companionable a way.

He continued the line that he had taken up, giving her time to command
herself fully, making no demands upon her and pretending that nothing
had been amiss. He swung himself on to the table, and talked easily,â€”

I feel so lucky and thankful for having whole limbs and a sane mind. I
donâ€™t covet genius, but I do covet sanity; in fact, Iâ€™m not sure that
the broadest genius isnâ€™t the supreme sanity. Balance and justice! I
think those two things are magnificent and grand, (but he himself, she
knew, would in practice always be merciful rather than just).

I wish I had your book-learning, she said; you ought to stick to
books.

Oh no, he replied, I like chemistry better, and those things.
Science.... If I hadnâ€™t to earn my living I shouldnâ€™t be working on
scents in this factory. No! Iâ€™d be in a country cottage with a
laboratory.

You do your best as it is, she said, touching his stack of scientific
books.

I had a bit of training at Edinburgh University, he said, in wistful
reminiscence, but one ought to dedicate years....

Who was your father? she asked after much deliberation whether she
might venture the question. She knew Morgan only as an isolated person,
who had arrived one day into the world of the factory, and had never
mentioned home or relations. She knew only that he was Scotch; he had a
very slight Scotch accent.

He was an Inverness crofter, he replied vaguely, I used to keep the
sheep on the hills in mists and snows, and properly I hated it. The days
were short, and I thought it was always winter. I used to sit shivering
on the brae-side, huddled in a plaid for shelter under a boulder, trying
to read while I kept one eye on the sheep. The pages of my book used to
get damp and limp, and the print got blurred when I tried to dry the
page with the corner of my jacket. Then somebody found out that I wasnâ€™t
getting any education, and reported it, so I was sent back to school,
and was happy again. And youâ€”you havenâ€™t lived here always, have you?

Since I was ten, she replied, sighing, we used to live in the south
before that ... I liked that, she said, it was a pretty place,
Midhurst, near Arundelâ€”perhaps you know it? She thought innocently, and
rather in the fashion of a child, that every one must know what she
knew.

I wish I did, but I donâ€™t.

Oh, itâ€™s under the Downs. Do you remember the day we walked with Silas
to Thorpeâ€™s Howland? that put me in mind of Midhurst; there were woods
round about Midhurst.

You enjoyed yourself that day, didnâ€™t you?

He expected a little burst of rhapsody from her, but she only said
quietly, Yes, I did, and he was aware of disappointment, and at the
same time of the little stinging charm of her occasional unexpectedness.

We both come from sheep country, then, he said, but the images evoked
in their minds were different: his of rough hills with their summits
lost in mist, and lochs lying amongst the windings at their base; of
dirty huddled flocks swept by wind and sleet; while hers were of cropped
downland under a blue and white open sky, with the shadows of the clouds
bowling across the downs and over the clumps of trees and little
church-steeples in the valleys. He realised the disparity, saying When
I say that, we see different pictures, and he smiled, but in his heart
he longed for their childhood to have run side by side either in the
Sussex or the Highland village. Have you ever been back there? he
asked.

Oh no; itâ€™s a long way from Lincolnshire. I was always at the factory
after I left school, and then when I was eighteen Mother died and I
married.

Only eighteen?

A week after my birthday.

How young! he said, with such rich and wondering compassion that she
looked suddenly as it were into the depths of a cool inexhaustible well,
always at hand for the quenching of her thirst. He was sitting on the
table near her, while their conversation flowed on in its effortless
interest, so that time and his books were forgotten. He seemed quite
absorbed in what they were saying, looking down at her with intent
consideration. They had attained an intimacy in which they could talk
untroubled; she found it very precious.

Now, Linnet! said Silasâ€™s bantering voice, making love to my
sister-in-law?


                                   VI

Silas became unwontedly withdrawn into himself, neither Nan nor Morgan
knew what to make of him. At times he avoided them, at other times
silently sought their company. Gregory, to whom Nan turned, after one
glance at his brother, replied, Let him alone, and she followed the
brief formula as being the best advice, finding that Silas only snarled
at her whenever she spoke to him. She was relieved rather than dismayed;
Silas surly was preferable to Silas honeyed.

He roamed alone, spending hours in the abbey after dusk; or ordered up
Hambley, and under the little manâ€™s guidance made his way to the
secluded summer-house at Malleson Place. Lady Malleson was also at a
loss to understand his altered manner; towards her he relaxed his
taciturnity, and his speech was more than ever wild and varied, but
although he ranged erratically she had the impression that his mind
rarely departed from one central subject, and she had also the shrewd
idea that that subject was his little sister-in-law, whom she had once
seen, and whom she vaguely thought a pretty, delicate, rather appealing
girl, unimportant until she had become the preoccupation of Silasâ€™s
thoughts.

So long as she had Silas with her, however, she cared very little what
he talked about. The utmost that she deplored, sometimes, was his
restlessness. It made her wonder whether she really held him. She
wondered, indeed, sometimes whether her hold on him was too light to
satisfy her vanity, or too secureâ€”all too secure!â€”for the preservation
of her safety and her convenience. She liked danger well enough, but
there was a point where danger might become too dangerous.

Wild man,â€”Ishmael, she said to him.

But he went on regardless with what he had been saying.

Thereâ€™s but one use for the body, he exclaimed, health. Not
mortificationâ€”thatâ€™s morbid. But _health_, lean and hard. Sinews like
whips. He bared a magnificent forearm. The only instance where I
practise what I preach, he added bitterly, causing the muscles to rise
at will.

Then you should respect your brother Gregory, she said, languidly
content.

You have seen him lately, my lady?

Yesterday, in the village.

The neatest of minds, in the body of a blacksmith, said Silas.

Neat?

Why, yesâ€”so long as he doesnâ€™t break out. Then he lays all around him,
smashes everything he can see, without commentâ€”that makes it quite
uncanny, I assure youâ€”and in a trice returns to his quiet and his
neatness as though nothing out of the way had happened. Heâ€™s very
inaccessible, my brother Gregory. No warnings. No explanations. No
remorse. Nothing apparently, but action.

You respect that, she said, looking at his fine bony face, and his
thick rough hair.

Think, if a manâ€™s killed, he brooded, killed by violent means, what
an outrage on the body. Blood spilt, that ran secretly and private in
his veins. Bones, no one had ever seen. Entrails. What a bursting!

She pictured his mind as a landscape ravaged by war, here a wreckage of
stone and twisted iron, there a grave, here the stark Calvary of a
stricken tree, there the bright blare of poppies striving for life
amongst the rushes and rank weeds.

You waste yourself, she said; you should be a martyr,â€”or a poet.

She liked to stir him, by such calculated remarks.

A second-rate poet? not I, he sneered instantly; then, as the flattery
stole over him, More likely a martyr, of the two, he said, responding.

You waste yourself, she repeated, drawing meanwhile slowly through her
fingers the long silk fringe of a shawl that lay thrown across her sofa,
you waste yourself, out of contempt. You eagle with broken wings!â€”she
knew with what gluttony he accepted such metaphors, and amused herself
when he wasnâ€™t with her by thinking out new ones that she might serve up
to him,â€”you repudiate comfort, donâ€™t you, in your dream of grandeur.
Will you end, I wonder, by getting neither? No one speaks to me like
your ladyship, he muttered reluctantly. She laughed. She enjoyed
pretending to an ideal of him that, his pride well fired, he would
strain himself to live up to; an ideal, moreover, that coincided so
adroitly with his own ideal of himself. I never knew a man so
vigorously reject the second-best. It was a pity, she continued,
smoothing out and patting down the fringe of the shawl, that you never
came across a woman to suit you. She raised her eyes to watch him as
she talked, and modulated her phrases according to the expression she
found on his face, nor did she trouble to conceal the busy mischief in
her own; there were advantages, certainly, in his blindness. How would
you have behaved, I wonder? she went on; you would have made a stormy
lover, I fancy, once your resistance had been thrown to the winds.
Stormy and exacting. Poor woman! Yet I dare say she wouldnâ€™t have
minded. Women are like that, you know. And for you,â€”no more loneliness,
no more unsatisfied longings, no more misanthropy. I believe youâ€™d have
grown into a different man. You would probably have achieved a good
deal.... But it would have taken a clever woman, a very clever woman, to
steer you without your knowing that you were being steered.

Women in my walk of life donâ€™t have time for cleverness, my lady, he
said acrimoniously, giving a literal answer to her words because he must
ignore the meaning which he read into them, and which, as he well knew,
she had intended him to read. Her ingenuity was tireless over
insinuations that put him on the rack. Clever, she had said; she was
clever enough! why hadnâ€™t they, he wondered, appointed women to sit upon
the tribunals of the Inquisition? If you had been born into my class,
or I into yours ... he burst out.

I donâ€™t admit impertinence, you know, Dene, she said in a voice of
ice, and anyway I am afraid I cannot give you any more time at
present.


                                  VII

Thus, always. He hated his bondage, he despised while he coveted the
woman, he hated her for holding him bound, but nothing, nothing was
comparable to his hatred and disgust of himself in his inability to get
free. Often he raved audibly, shaking his fists; and those who saw him
stopped to listen to his mutterings, and thought what an alarming sight
Silas Dene presented, with his wild blind eyes and furrowed mouth that
mumbled and let drop the tiny river of saliva. He was often to be seen
thus in the abbey, of an evening, prowling in the aisles; where
occasionally on a Sunday he would be perceived by the rare visitor
attracted to Abbotâ€™s Etchery, that strange island of factory and Norman
abbey emerging amidst the floods, sufficiently singular to be worth the
journey out from Lincoln; and those who saw him there went away saying
that not the least arresting sight in the desolate encampment was the
blind man who in savagery and loneliness haunted the precincts of the
abbey, and whose incoherent ravings could be readily changed by a little
encouragement into a tirade of such vehemence, such angry bitterness,
such bewildering aggression. They went away wondering what ailed him, to
have made of him so baffling and solitary a figure.


                                  VIII

Rumour, at the same time, began to trot like a jackal round the figure
of Silas. There was the incident, never very clear to the village, of
the fire. Loyalty of course silenced Nan and Morgan; and Hambley, to a
very large extent silenced through fear, dared do no more than drop
hints that Silas could scarcely trace back to him. Nevertheless, a taste
of the story got about, a taste that the village relished and rolled
over on its tongue, both in the workshops and the public bar,â€”for gossip
that penetrated the fiercely secluded house of the Denes, and brought to
light even the tip of one of their buried secrets, had a legendary smack
denied to topics more vulgar and more frequently accessible.

Also, Lady Mallesonâ€™s name was murmured, behind the shelter of a raised
hand.

Nan was aware of the curious looks, thrown at her because she had been
with Silas during the fire; and Morgan, aware of similar looks, met them
with a contemptuous impatience; but Silas for some days knew of nothing
amiss. Only when he stood up to speak at the debating-club, down in the
concert-room, he heard a murmur pass through his audience, a murmur of
resentment and disapproval. It was as though the accumulated resentment
of the men, repressed hitherto out of a lack of understanding, a certain
awe, and even a grudging admiration, had now broken its bonds under a
definite provocation that had submerged their submission by arousing
their disgust. It was a low murmur, compounded of irritation, criticism,
and of mutiny under a tyranny they no longer respected and were
therefore no longer prepared to admit. Silas heard it, and with his fist
already lifted for his peroration, stopped himself dead.

He faced them, standing alone under the dark frown of many sulky and
rebellious looks.

Some one spoke? he demanded.

He was accustomed to exact silence when he took up the debate.

He had very little time to decide his course of action; he knew that
they were against him; knew, obscurely, why; and dared not press home
the question.

Morgan was not present, or he might have tided over the matter, out of
pity for Silas, who in his defiance looked so extraordinarily gaunt and
solitary, and so undefeatably proud.

Morgan, however, was busy elsewhere, so that Silas faced only a lowering
throng, that sat obstinate, chins thrust forward into palms and murmured
still, with deliberate intent to affront, but without the courage to
bring clear accusation.

This isnâ€™t the treatment Iâ€™m accustomed to receive here, Silas bayed
at them finally, and until Iâ€™m invited Iâ€™ll no longer trouble you.
Invited I said, and invited I meant. If Iâ€™m sought up at my own house
perhaps Iâ€™ll reconsider it, and come back to you. For the present,
good-night to you all.

One, more kind-hearted than the rest, and perhaps ashamed, rose clumsily
to intercept him as he went towards the door.

Iâ€™ll help you, Dene.

Silas thrust him aside, and strode away alone.


                                   IX

When this story had come to the ears of Nan and Morgan, they whispered
The fire! and crept away from one another sooner than disturb a
subject of which they could not bear to speak.

The fire had taken place at night, and had not been in itself of any
importance. You see nothing but a few tarred sheds burning, Silas had
cried, in a frenzy of desperation to Morgan, and folk will come to me
to-morrow to say you acted gallantly, or what not. Why shouldnâ€™t you,
seeing only wood and flames? You donâ€™t hear it coming after you with
great light strides and flaming fingers....

Silas, youâ€™re afraid, Morgan had said gravely.

Silas had checked himself at that; he had quavered, and made an effort
to recover. The accusation had fallen like a plummet into the
uncontrolled waters of his mind. He had quavered, and almost gibbered at
Morgan; so greatly fallen beneath his normal standard of pride and
independence that he had been shocking to hear and see. He had tried to
defend himself, Not afraid, only helpless, helpless....

Nan and Morgan had stood, hearing him beseech them not to leave him. Nan
knew then that Silas was betrayed by fear into revealing something he
usually kept very, very carefully concealed; that was why the exposure
was so shocking and so degrading; and Morgan seeing it with her eyes
stood beside her, both equally hurt, and equally craving to rescue
Silas. But he, in his mingled panic and resentment, had had nothing but
insults for them, and, nearly screaming, told Morgan to clear out.

Shall I stay with you? Nan had asked.

He had hesitated; he wanted to fling her out, he tried to make himself
say, No, go! but his extreme terror was stronger than this flicker of
his other, antagonistic. He said, Yes, you can stay, a heat of hatred
for her passing over him as he said it.


                                   X

They had sat in silence after Morgan had gone, because Silas had
forbidden her to speak. She was glad of the hush, for she felt that she
had passed through a great empty din and that the brass vacancy of
cymbals was still clanging in her ears. The scene had wounded her, and
had roused emotions that bewildered her. Why should she resent (to the
extent of stretching out deterrent hands, as she had done,) the betrayal
of Silas by himself? Somewhere, though she would neither have probed nor
acknowledged, she had believed that underneath her fear and pity lay
hatred of Silas; she had even tried to extend her pity into a reassuring
mental scorn. Yet to him, who never spared others, she had had the
impulse to cry, Spare yourself. She had suffered from seeing him
untrue to his own tradition.

They sat in silence, Silas tearing at the seat of a rush-bottomed chair,
Nan watching the unequal glow in the sky outside the windows. She found
herself trembling from time to time. Not with fear of the fire, but with
disgust and regret of that noisy scene. She wished that something would
happen to restore him to his ancient formidable credit, something to
remove that disquieting sense of his fraudulence. She turned away from
him, but next moment was glancing at him again; he was destroying the
seat of the chair, shred by shred, his fine hands pulling at the rushes
with a peevish haste and his head bent obstinately away from
observation. Every time a siren hooted he hunched himself more closely
together, as though the compression of his limbs would afford him some
protection.

I think the glare is dying down, Silas, she said gently.

He hunched himself fretfully away.

He was thinking, They are full of forbearance and long-suffering. Am I
to be taught gratitude? perhaps through disaster? They would let God
himself look into every corner of their minds. Little children! For the
moment, under the effect of his fear, he did not brand them as lacking
in savour. Their limpidity seemed to him as desirable as the absence of
danger. If danger might but be removed he would abandon as the price his
own arrogant passions. He was humbled now to another standard of life.
Weary of battle and opposition, peace appeared to him sweet and seemly,
now that he had been granted tumult,â€”a tumult not of his own making, and
entirely out of the control of his stage-managing. He thought again,
They have never a quick word against me. Nan gave me a stick, and I
broke it and said I wanted no stick, because I knew she expected me to
show pleasure. I am sure that after I broke it she had tears in her
eyes. But why should she try to coax me with presents? or I allow myself
to be coaxed? He shuddered at the long scream of a siren, and reflected
that they had probably kept the extent of the fire from him, knowing
that he could not verify. For an instant he caught hold of the idea that
the fire might get across the village to the abbey, and destroy that;
and a little flash of old wicked glee passed across him. But it died
away. He imagined the fire travelling down his own street, men and women
flying before it, and he himself forgotten, engulfed,â€”perhaps even
purposely left to perish. At this point he spoke, Are you there, Nan?
She was there. I never meant you any harm, Nan, he said surprisingly.
Warm-hearted, she was at his side as the words left his lips. No,
Silas, I know that.... Thatâ€™ll do, he said pushing her away.

But he had now started upon another train of thought, which he adopted
and amplified with his usual vehemence. God preserve me, and I will
live to befriend Nan and Linnet. Obscurely he had the instinct of
propitiation, offering his intention as a bribe to a very angry god; and
partially in his chastened mood,â€”albeit but the vile chastening of
terror,â€”he yielded to the stirrings of his own repressed sentimentalism.
Simplicity, limpidity, were perhaps not the poor and bloodless
attributes he had thought. Their case might be turned convincingly by a
skilful advocate. He, Silas, had the mettle of strife within him; those
other two had not: (The fire! the fire! in the meanderings of his
arguments he had almost forgotten the fire. In the rush of recollection
he knotted his fingers together till they cracked. He was horribly
afraid.) Those two did not fight and wrestle with chimeras, muscles
knotted and sweat pouring, as Silas did. Their minds were not ridden by
demons. They did not sight everywhere a portent, a dark enemy or a
fiercely fair ally. He had scorned them as easy, milky, satisfied,â€”he
knew well the run of the familiar epithets. He had tried to scorn them;
he had forsworn their kindness. He had crushed his love for them, and
his longing to allow the warm tide of that love to flow in solace over
him. He had been proud, and had driven his craft ever to sea, courting
the gales and riot, rather than accept the broad comfort of the haven.
Proud! proud! how superbly proud! how proportionately base the physical
fear that could humble such a spirit of arrogance in man!


                                   XI

A cry from Nan brought him to his feet, chattering. What it it? what is
it? in a renewed access of fear. Oh, Silas! she exclaimed, coming
close to him, thereâ€™s Hambley looking in through the window; tell him
to go away, oh, please tell him to go away! He does what you tell him
always.

Hambley was indeed pressing his face against the window, and the shape
of his head was dark against the red sky. He was so small that he was
only just able to reach the window by climbing to the outside sill with
the tips of his fingers, and the end of his nose was flattened white
upon the pane. Nan could see the grin on his evil little face. Silas
strode to the door, flung it open, and summoned the little man. At the
end of the street the night was torn by flames.

As soon as Hambley was inside he seized the little man by his collar.
Now what were you doing, peeping into my house when you thought you
wouldnâ€™t be found out? You little skunk, Iâ€™ve always called you, and so
you are. You frightened Nan, you little skunk. You meant to spy upon me.
Well, youâ€™ll see what you get! Holding him easily with one hand,
sometimes swinging him clean off his feet, so that he twirled and
dangled in mid-air, Silas thrashed him with his fist, and Hambley
shrieked and appealed to Nan, and tried, but quite vainly, to kick
Silas. Nan got into a corner, out of the way of the blows. When he had
finished, Silas carried him over to the door and threw him regardlessly
out into the street.


                                  XII

Morgan came back at midnight, and said that the fire was over, not
having spread beyond the sheds. He was rubbing his blackened hands on a
piece of waste. His eyes fell upon the litter of shredded rushes
scattered in witness on the floor near Silas. Nan drooped, pale and
tired. He began to tell her about the fire, trying to brighten her and
to make her feel that she was no longer a prisoner alone with Silas. He
was purposely taking no notice of Silas, but presently looked up to see
the blind man standing above them.

He appeared to be immensely tall and haggard, and upon his face was a
look of suffering, which by the accentuation of furrow and wrinkle gave
the suggestion that he was unkempt. His limbs and torso were hugely,
grotesquely reproduced in shadow upon the walls and ceiling behind him.
Inscrutable to them, he loomed over Nan and Linnet. At last he spoke.

Youâ€™re glad to have him back, Nan. Youâ€™re glad to come back to her,
Linnet.

Their eyes met in tremulous surprise; was Silas to serve as their
interpreter?

You little, dainty people! Oh, yes. I know. Gentle in your dealings.
Amiable. Indulgent. You donâ€™t criticiseâ€”criticismâ€™s uncharitableâ€”might
hurt somebodyâ€™s feelings. Let things remain as they are; donâ€™t disturb.
Moderation! Thatâ€™s your creed. Make terms. Compromise! He dropped
ejaculations, and swung into his most rhetorical vein, in which he
seemed really possessed by a spirit that released the unfaltering words.
O pliant ones of the earth! blessed are the meek, and flowers shall
revive at your passage. Wander into the woods; call to the roe-deer to
eat from your hand. Look with envy at the pairing foxes, the nesting
birds; no creature so wild that it may escape the yearly call of home.
If the fox and the vixen together can burrow their earth for shelter and
the whelping of their litter, cannot you two together build a hut of
boughs and branches in a clearing beside the stream? Listen: I covet no
love, I am debarred; and love when it touches men like me is no virtue,
only an indulgence of self and a lapse from strength. He laughed. Who
would be weak? or bestial? But in you, love shall attain its highest
purpose of usefulness and steadfastness. To be steadfast in love is
reserved to man; it is the conscious will of love, the sustained reason.
Without it, as well be a dog, and couple in the street. Are you fit? You
are young and your minds are counterparts; you have no business with me
or with Gregory. Leave me to Gregory, and Gregory to me; the dumb shall
lead the blind, and the blind shall speak for the dumb. But you, go out,
where no strife assails, and concern yourselves with labour. You are the
builders, and we are the destroyers; we are the cursed, and you are the
blessed. You and your like must build your security upon the ruins of us
and our like; itâ€™s the natural law. I might have been another man, but
God saw fit to twist me; he wrenched my spirit and upon each of my eyes
in turn he laid a finger.

They sat absolutely speechless, confused and confounded that he should
thus trumpet out the secret they had hitherto guarded from one another.
They had wondered and suffered and trembled much, but of all outcomes
this was an outcome they had certainly never foreseen. It broke over
them like a natural catastrophe; Silas was making it into something
beyond the diapason of their souls.

Build! he said passionately, earnestly, build with your sanity and
your health. Leave query and destruction to the tormented spirits; there
will always be enough of those; and if you did but know,â€”oh, world! he
said, clasping his hands, if you did but know, you would pity the
precursor, solitary and bold. Then comes the army of the workers, with
honest tools, and their flowing quietness.â€”Why should you struggle, you
two, beside Gregory and me? You should be side by side, perfectly
matched, amongst children who should resemble you. Tell me, he said,
bending down to them, you love?

When he reduced it to those naked terms, they were ashamed into honesty,
both towards him and towards each other; they assented, as though he
were a priest reading over them a terrible and simple marriage-service.

Then you shall have the courage to love. You shall go unmolested. You
were intended to fulfil, not to renounce. Who pretends to one law for
all? Not I; I wouldnâ€™t dare utter such a heresy of intolerance. Not in
my sane moments. Who would take a field-bird up into the mountains? His
place is simpler; sweeter....

He suddenly put his hands over his face, and his voice faltered, as
though he were spent and had nothing more to say.

Go away now, he said fretfully, Iâ€™m tired out.




                                   XI


                                   I

This wound, this gash, to be exposed to the village! How greedily they
would lick up his blood! they would set upon him with claw and fang as
upon a lion brought low. No delight could equal the delight over the
dictator shamed, or the eagerness with which those in subjection would
pounce upon the infallible taken in fault. But, while knowing the story
of the fire to be common gossip, he would grant no concessions; he
stalked about the streets in challenging pride, more than usually
unkempt, more than usually fierce, an object of whispered comment for
all those who had expected him to keep himself at last within bounds. It
was noticed that when spoken to, he threw back his head as though it had
been crowned with a mane, and his answers were too haughty to be set
down as the cheaper insolence. The men were a little impressed, but to
give themselves determination they continued to mutter against him.
Calthorpe knew it, and was concerned. He hinted something to Sir Robert
Malleson, but Malleson had received an anonymous letter which disturbed
and occupied every energy of his mind, and was unsympathetic. The only
person with whom Calthorpe could get a hearing was Mr. Medhurst, who
called at Silasâ€™s cottage, and came away saying blandly that Dene was an
altered being. Why had Calthorpe so distressed himself over Deneâ€™s state
of mind, and the attitude of the village? He could not understand.
Calthorpe in his kind-heartedness had surely been mistaken.

Why, Dene, I am very happy to find you in so Christian a spirit. Poor
Mr. Medhurst suffered greatly from the trap of his phraseology; it made
all intercourse with his fellows a source of self-consciousness so acute
that he felt justified in counting every visit as a mortification. Yet
he was unable to control it. Visits to Silas Dene were a special
mortification; he had to pray for strength before setting out, and now
Mrs. Gregory Dene, a good little soul, was not there to help him. Of
course, you are a church-goer; I often see you in the abbey, Mr.
Medhurst pursued.

Yes, sir, Silas replied gravely.

You seem to prefer the evening services? Ah well, I dare say they fit
in better with your work. Silas made no reply, but sat smiling to
himself. Mr. Medhurst started another topic, What pretty flowers you
have always in here, Dene.

Yes, sir, my sister-in-law does that.

She must be a great comfort to you, Dene, since ... well, since you
have been by yourself ... you know....

Since my wife was killed, sir.

Well ... yes; yes, after all, that is what I meant. I should like to
say, Dene, that I admire extremely the courage you have displayed under
your sorrow; I think I may claim that I am not unobservantâ€”although, God
knows, sorely wanting in other qualities, I add in all humility. I will
confess that your conduct at the inquest impressed me most painfully,
but we need not dwell upon that; since then I have had nothing but
praise for your demeanour.

Indeed, sir?

Yes, indeed. I was saying so to Sir Robert Malleson only the other day.
It gives me great pleasure to say so to you now. You are a brave man,
Dene. He pronounced the words brave man separately and with emphasis,
and allowed a suitable emotion to rise through his tone.

Thank you, sir.

Not at all, Dene, not at all. It is only your due.

Well, sir, perhaps we all have liftings towards honour, said Silas
demurely.

Hâ€™m! said Mr. Medhurst. What strange phrases the man employed!
Liftings towards honour. What could that mean? But he was certainly
quieter; quieter and better-mannered, and his frequent presence at
evening service was a hopeful sign, though Mr. Medhurst had noticed with
a vague misgiving that he took no part in the responses.


                                   II

Two days after the fire Silas received a summons from Lady Malleson, a
summons that he had been expecting because he knew Malleson was away. It
was brought to him not by Hambley as usual (that was scarcely
surprising), but by Emma, Lady Mallesonâ€™s maid. Would he come
immediately? she, Emma, was to bring him back. Iâ€™ll wait for you, Mr.
Dene; youâ€™ll be wanting to brush up a bit, she said, looking at his
dirty hands and untidy hair, but he scoffed at the suggestion and said
that they should start at once.

In his impatience he forced the maid to a great pace, dragging her along
rather than allowing her to lead him. She kept exclaiming that he would
stumble over roots and rabbit-holes as they crossed the park, but he
brushed her caution aside. Youâ€™re very particular not to keep her
ladyship waiting, said she meaningly, not appreciating this walk with
blind Dene, of whom so many strange tales were told. Little Hambley had
been seen that morning up at Malleson Place, scowling and limping in the
stable-yard, and the grooms with much relish had said that Silas Dene
had given him a thorough thrashing. Little Hambley had, of course, not
owned to it. He had snapped viciously in reply to their chaff. Emma
longed to ask Silas whether the story was true, but as no one ever asked
questions of Silas, she, like many others, held her tongue.


                                  III

He was taken up to the sitting-room, introduced by the maid, and left
just inside the door, as on the occasion of his first visit. But now he
knew the way about the room.

In the house to-day, my lady? he said, I like the garden-house
better.

And you want your own way, as usual? she asked.

You say that as though you hated me, he said, stopping dead.

What a sensitive ear you have, she replied cruelly. I do.

There was a finality about this pronouncement which caused him to take
it with the utmost seriousness. Her tones were chill and bloodless and
dead, and they disquieted him, so much that he advanced not another
step, but remained readjusting his mood, which had been eager, to one of
defence. He was horribly startled. It was fortunate for him that he
could not see her; she had retreated from him as far as the size of the
room would allow, behind the sofa, where she stood shivering as though
with cold, her eyes fixed and unblinking, her hand laid upon her loose
garment to hold it close at the throat, and all her muscles gathered
ready for swift escape at any sign of advance on his part.

I should not have sent for you, she said, but I knew you could not
read a letter if I wrote you one, and I did not care to send you a
message through any of my servants. I donâ€™t want to keep you long, as I
only want to tell you that I am leaving for London to-morrow and shall
not be seeing you again. I could certainly have sent you a message to
tell you that. But I wanted to tell you my reason myself.

She had prepared beforehand what she intended to say, for her safeguard
lay in frigidity of speech, and to achieve that she must maintain
frigidity of feeling. That had been easy before he came; but when she
saw him her cold anger had been shaken, her contempt had wavered beneath
a return of her old respect, and her audacity in risking danger had
revived. I wanted to tell you my reason, she resumed, but before
doing so I must own that you had completely taken me in. I thought I
knew you well, but I knew only that part of you which you were willing
that I should know. I thought I had made in you the discovery of
something really rather remarkable. I was rather pleased with myself
over it. I know now that I have been stupidly mistaken. Your elaborate
fraud deceived me as being a genuine thing....

I can see you have learnt all this by heart, he interrupted. She
flamed up no less at his perspicacity than at his rudeness.

Very well, she cried, Iâ€™ll drop my stilted phrases. I did prepare
them, but they are true, for all that. I have found you out. You
interested me, you even impressed me,â€”I hate you for it. Youâ€™re nothing
but a sham and a coward.

Itâ€™s not true, said Silas, growing very pale.

Itâ€™s so true, she said quickly, that the words Iâ€™ve just used to you
are the very words you have always most dreaded hearing. A sham and a
coward. Youâ€™re such a coward that there have been moments when you were
glad you were blind, because that saved you from dangers other men were
expected to undertake. You were quite safe to talk about danger; your
blindness sheltered you, and words couldnâ€™t possibly hurt. Am I not
speaking the truth? Your blindness has been your best friend, as well as
your worst enemy,â€”your worst enemy, because it favoured your horrible
imagination, and provided a darkness that you peopled with shapes; your
best friend, because all the time it preserved you from having to
practise what you preached. See how I know you now. I suppose it amused
you to deceive me, to see just how far you could go, and sometimes when
you thought youâ€™d put your foot an inch over the line of my credulity
you drew it back very skilfully. Now I have simply found you out for
what you are. I have learnt the story of the fire two nights ago.

Nan! exclaimed Silas, in a burst of fury.

Not at all; I have seen Hambley. I donâ€™t wish to make any mystery. He
came to see me this morning, whining and snivelling, and told me the
whole story: how you had lost your head, how you had gibbered with
frightâ€”gibbered was the word he usedâ€”he says you went like this, and
she imitated a man in the extremity of terror, working her mouth,
distending her eyes and nostrils, and clacking her fingers; he was not
pretty to watch, Dene. Then he told me how you had dragged him in and
beaten him for looking in through your window; he was quite shrewd
enough to see that you seized upon the pretext of beating him merely as
a relief to your nerves, that fright had exasperated. He came to me in
order to be revenged on you, and also, I think, because he wanted to
whimper to some one. He says you went upon your knees to young Morgan,
and that Morgan was laughing at you, though you didnâ€™t know it, and that
even your sister-in-law smiled more than once behind her hand. Well,
thatâ€™s the picture I carry away of you, Dene. You can hardly be
surprised that I regret the kindness I have shown to you. I have made a
great mistake which I shall know better than to repeat in the future.
She hardened herself, she mentally insisted on her relief at escaping
from a situation which she had felt to be getting beyond her control.
There were many incidents she remembered with discomfort, and her
husband had been very peremptory, when, the anonymous letter in his
hand, he had come to her, If I thought there was any truth in these
revolting hints ... yes, decidedly, Hambleyâ€™s revelations had been very
opportune as an excuse for getting rid of Silas. She thought, on the
whole, she had manÅ“uvred her opportunities ably.

Hambley shall pay for this.

Hambley must take care of himself, she replied, I have no doubt that
you will invent some form of revenge which will interest you very much
as a new experiment, and you will improve it and refine it and fiddle
over it, like some magician preparing a brew. I should never, at any
moment, have had any doubts as to that. I should like you to understand
that I always knew you for cruel, unscrupulous, and without heart or
conscience; I thought you a ruthless man, but where I went wrong was in
not thinking you despicable. I could have respected you for
thorough-going villainy,â€”yes, I thought there was a certain largeness of
gesture about your discontent,â€”but I have only contempt for the sham.

Her voice had grown still more cold and level; it licked sharply round
his vanity, and as ever, his instinct flew to physical violence. He
snarled, and moved in her direction, knocking over a small table, but
she dodged him.

Keep quiet, Dene, she said, in the same glacial tone, we really
cannot play this ridiculous game of blindmanâ€™s buff.


                                   IV

He saw that he could do nothing against her, and indeed was too proud to
try. His pride had risen correspondingly to his humiliation; he would
show her that something, at all events, in him was not a sham. He was
terribly, doubly hurt,â€”hurt in his heart, and hurt, too, with the uneasy
wound of pride, his pride towards her, his pride towards himself. All
that she had said had been so true; she had found the truth as a weapon,
and had beaten him with it across the face. He was so battered, so
gashed with scorn, that he was surprised to find himself still alive and
sentient. But he _was_ sentient. He _was_ indomitable. His life was so
strong that it had not been knocked even temporarily unconscious. It
stirred: he spoke.

I shall say nothing to justify myself, he began. If your ladyship
wishes to think ill of me you must do so, although I dare say I could
alter your opinion. He was prompted to say this by a phrase that had
occurred to his mind, and which gave him some private consolation, I
have, after all, murdered my wife, defied God, and banished my own son.
But he did not say these words aloud. You are of course free, my lady,
he went on, to dismiss me without being besought by me. You call me a
coward; you forget I have the courage to live alone.

The egoism, she amended.

No! he said sharply, itâ€™s discipline, not inclination, and it began
when I was a boy, because I wouldnâ€™t have pity. Now itâ€™s a habit. Iâ€™ve
shut myself off from pity. Iâ€™m well schooled.

Is that all you have to say? asked Lady Malleson, as he ceased.

Did you expect me to plead for mercy? You were quite right when you
said you knew only the part of me that I was willing for you to know. If
you had known everything, my lady, you might have been startled. He was
nursing his secret phrase. But I plan very carefully what I shall
betray to different people. Being blind, I must invent things to think
about.

You are a demon! broke from Lady Malleson.

Silas smiled a bitter, gratified smile; he had at least succeeded in
making her angry. Having done so, could he reconquer her? Should he risk
the affront of failure? She was all he had. No! if she cared so little,
let her go. He would not submit to being patronised, to being kept on
sufferance by the woman who alone had the privilege of twisting the
strings of his heart. If that privilege, so grudgingly, so agonisingly
accorded, were to be so little esteemed, let her go! What matter? A
loneliness the more.

I thought at first that I would tell Emma to bring you to the abbey,
she resumed, more quietly; I thought that the setting would please you
and satisfy your sense of histrionics. It would have been so thoroughly
Silasian. For you _are_ histrionic, arenâ€™t you, Silas?

Perhaps, he said.

You and I, sitting on two cane chairs, in the dark abbey, she went on,
while I poured out to you in an undertone all my opinion of you, my new
opinion, for the first time, my true opinion, and then, who knows? the
organist might have come in to practise, and so provided an
accompaniment for your answer. I really believe your answer would have
varied according to the music. It would tickle you to sway your life on
a dainty chance like that. I wonder that I overcame the temptation.

A great pity, said Silas indifferently, but as though he had allowed
himself to be beguiled a moment by the charm of the suggestion. She was
annoyed with herself; she felt that she had allowed her irony to run
away with her, to become a little too wild, especially when he continued
in a tone of irreproachable conventionality, I must now thank your
ladyship for the kindness shown in the past and for the many hours I
have been allowed to spend at Malleson Place. I appreciate that it isnâ€™t
many poor chaps like me thatâ€™s given the advantage. Itâ€™s been a gift
blown me by the ill wind of my wifeâ€™s death and my blindness. Your
ladyship has a kind heart,â€”they all say so in the village when they hear
of the favours shown to blind Dene. As he spoke he made small staccato
movements with his fingers, bearing a resemblance to the dart of
Gregoryâ€™s pencil in some minute alteration of his designs, a family
resemblance, that in its finicky precision was equally incongruous to
both brothers; in Silas the gestures seem to indicate the finishing
touches to a work of art about to be laid aside; the touches were given,
possibly, with regret, but still with a certain affectionate
satisfaction, as to work well done, and opportunely completed; (he
marvelled at himself even as he spoke and gesticulated); they irritated
Lady Malleson with a small, wiry irritation, like some insignificant but
exasperating physical pain, causing her to forget what she had called
the grandeur of Silas, and to remember only the warped, malicious
artistry in which he appeared to take delight.

Then he changed; he towered; he dwarfed her; all her superiority went in
a flash.

Listen, he said then, so suddenly that she had the impression that he
had stepped bodily out of a disguise,â€”Your interest in me may have been
unreal to you,â€”how could it have been otherwise? You are a fine lady,
you have been through many experiences; Iâ€™m a rough fellow, and I dare
say bitter and brutal enough....

You like to think yourself brutal, donâ€™t you? she interjected.

Such as I was, he said, you had me; are you proud of what you made of
me?â€”Oh! he said, hearing her movement of impatience, I wonâ€™t make you
discourse; only that question I wanted to ask you: are you proud of what
you made? Only this: was I _so_ unworthy of your ladyship? Have you been
sullied by my contact? Or have I, by God, he thundered at her, been
sullied by yours? Iâ€™m not so sure. What are you wondering in your mind
now? whether you can trust me to go away and hold my tongue? You think
you wonâ€™t risk putting the idea of indiscretion into my head; you
probably think it will come there quite soon enough by itself. Are you
any less of a coward than I? You need have no anxiety, Iâ€™m not tempted
to revenge myself on you in that way,â€”you think of that, youâ€™re
preoccupied with that, but do you think at all of what you may have done
to me? You picked me up casually, and you think you can put me down in
the same way. But, between picking me up and putting me down, youâ€™ve
worked on me; you donâ€™t leave me quite the same as you found me; and Iâ€™m
not an easy metal.

She was frightened when he said that, and muttered hurriedly, I hope I
havenâ€™t done you any harm.

One doesnâ€™t know what harm or good one does, he replied, working-man
or grand lady. Youâ€™ll go your way. Iâ€™m asking you only whether youâ€™ll
remember me with pride, or whether youâ€™ll think of yourself as one of
the things that dragged me back, when I was always trying to escape? Iâ€™m
not strong, you know. Iâ€™m not strong. Iâ€™m only cursed with a spirit
thatâ€™s totally beyond my strength.

I donâ€™t understand, she said uneasily; she tried to tell herself that
he was making a great fuss; but she could not get away from the idea
that the fuss was tragically weighted.

Youâ€™re quite safe, he said, with extraordinary gentleness. I never
wanted to love, you know, either you or any one else; I often told you
so; but it isnâ€™t love that I abuse, only the weakness that submits to
it. And I have to acknowledge that you are wise in getting rid of me.
Iâ€™m all awry, you know; misbegotten; and folk like me are better left
alone; their misfortune only rubs off on to other people. You are wise
to protect yourself; thatâ€™s always a wise thing to do. I could wish only
that you had done it earlier; you would have made it easier for me.

The melancholy of his reproach surprised her into saying, Is it at this
moment that youâ€™re speaking from your heart, or was it just now? and
she remembered the sharp finicky gestures he had made when he thanked
her for the kindness she had shown him. To what extent are you
theatrical? she asked, in a little outburst of bad temper.

That isnâ€™t a question I should answer, even if I had the answer at the
tip of my tongue, he replied. You may think, if you choose, that I am
never sincere. (She thought, He is going back to his old manner. She
was greatly thankful.) Perhaps I am no more sincere, he continued,
standing there, than any of your ladyshipâ€™s little gimcracks in this
room. His reference to her gimcracks was not contemptuous; he seemed
rather to be translated into a region where a large gentleness held
sway. Ironically enough, she thought that she had never seen him before,
although this was the last time she was seeing him. A similar idea
appeared to strike him at the same moment, for he said, All along, I
have fought against you, and tried to disguise myself from you. It
doesnâ€™t matter now. I seem always to be fighting,â€”floundering
about,â€”donâ€™t I? I wonder whether I shall ever get away? away from
myself? Would your ladyship ring for Emma now? I should like to go.

She got up wearily and crossed the room to the bell. He was standing
there, no longer scathing, but quiet, patient, and tired. She looked at
him; and, going swiftly to him, she caught his hand.

Listen, Silas. Perhaps Iâ€™ve been too hasty. Listen to me. Perhaps I
need not dismiss you altogether ... I might reconsider....

No, he brought out with extreme firmness, as though he extorted from a
long way off the last tragic effort of an overstrained will.

As you please, she said, dropping his hand, and in her angry haste she
threw open the door to urge the maid who was coming to lead him away.




                                  XII


                                   I

Gregory still worked obstinately among the vats. Calthorpe had tried to
coax him away to the engine-rooms, but got no more answer than a shake
of the head. In his secret mind, Gregory was preparing a scheme, now
nearly complete, that would reorganise the whole working of the factory;
he saw himself as its originator and supervisor, and was far too proud
to accept a preliminary post as a unit among a number of mechanics. He
was living for the day when, before an assembled board-meeting, he would
lay his designs upon the table; although he could not explain them by
speech, their beautiful precise simplicity would explain itself while he
stood aside, arms folded, and read the effect upon the faces of the
directors. (He had tested some designs upon Calthorpe,â€”not those
designs, of course,â€”and the overseer had been seriously impressed.
Gregory knew with calm certainty, untouched by diffidence, that his work
was good.) Perhaps he would take Nan with him as interpreter to the
board-meeting; she was intelligent, her small fingers flew fast, and it
would be a compensation, in some guise, for the hours he had spent away
from her in abstraction over his drawings.

Meanwhile, time progressing towards that day, he worked in the gallery
of vats. It was a sort of grotesque vigil. He hated the nauseous,
automatic work, but obliged himself to keep to it with a strength of
mind that Silas wholly appreciated. Day after day he climbed the long
iron ladder to the upper gallery, dressed in splashed and grimy
overalls, and renewed his occupation, trundling hand-barrows, emptying
an over-full or cooling an overheated vat. When he had to do this he
stripped to the waist, and stirred and flacked the boiling slime with a
weapon shaped like a flail. Sweat ran from him, and in the gaunt gallery
of iron girders, amongst the vats of moving yellow fat, the play of his
shining muscles and sculptural body stood out as a classical and noble
revelation.

Regarding Nan as his chattel, he never wondered whether he was or was
not agreeable to her, and in his egoism never noticed her sensitive
wilting under his caresses. His pride and his machines were
personalities infinitely more living to him than the instrument of
comfort and pleasure that was his wife. When he had married her, he
had loved her in a rough animal way, that never had in it a streak of
consideration or unselfishness; it had amused him to possess as a toy
something so weak, so little, and so pretty, and in the first weeks of
their marriage he had devised games for his own satisfaction, to pick
her up between both hands and lift her till her head touched the
ceiling, or to catch her up and run with her along the dykeâ€”such
eccentric sports, that half frightened her, half pleased her instinct
by his display of strength. Then he had grown accustomed to her
flitting presence. He had ceased to raise his head when she came into
the room, or to finger with wonderment her small hands, or to turn
over with derisive affection the ribbons, cottons, and odds and ends
in her work-box. She ceased to be so distinctly, so newly, Nan, and
became merely one of the little knot of four living in the
double-cottage,â€”himself, Silas, Nan, and Hannah. He watched her when
he had nothing better to do, just as he watched Silas or Hannah, or,
nowadays, Linnet, but within the vaults of silence his true life was
turned inwards upon himself.

And Silas was studying him; Silas studying Gregory! Communication
between them was almost non-existent; Silas could, indeed, write on a
piece of paper and Gregory could read the message, but, beyond a clumsy
finger-system relating only to elementary practical matters,â€”names of
objects, and such,â€”Gregory was quite unable to converse with Silas.
Silas foresaw therefore that he would have no means of judging the
effects of his observations on Gregoryâ€™s mind. But difficulties only
whetted his ingenuity. He needed an occupation and an opiate as he had
never needed them before,â€”not that he allowed himself to own to
this,â€”and the double disaster he had undergone, far from humbling him,
stung him to a determination of mischief that welcomed any obstacle as
an additional employment for his days. He stood at his work in the
shops, before a trestle table, making the square boxes into parcels, and
as he tied the string he fancied that every knot secured a further mesh
in the net he was weaving round unsuspecting lives.


                                   II

But all the while he was gnawed by sorrow for what he was doing. Nan!
Linnet! so young, so disarming! he knew he loved them both. In his mind
they were children. Could he but struggle out of the deadly groove of
perversity that held him, could he but shake off the innumerable fetters
of his small malignities! As well hope to shake off the physical
cowardice that was his secret torment and his shame. To rise! to escape!
to leave behind all the indignity of petulance and rancour! at times he
fancied almost that he could hear the beating of great wings, and a kind
of swoon overtook him, as one who has fasted, or has remained too long
in mystic contemplation; but, emerging from it, he was instantly wrapped
up again in the cold craftiness of his schemings, that tangled
themselves round him as surely as he would tangle them round others.


                                  III

He must forget Lady Malleson. He wished that the cause of his disgrace
could have been different; those words, a coward and a sham, left a
bad taste in his mouth; there was no getting round them, and no getting
round the incident of the fire; he wished passionately that the whole
thing might be blotted out: there was Nanâ€™s knowledge, Morganâ€™s
knowledge, Lady Mallesonâ€™s knowledge,â€”that was the worst,â€”and lastly
Hambleyâ€™s knowledge, but his contempt for Hambley was so great that he
could disregard everything from that quarter. But he could not pretend
to himself to disregard the knowledge of those other three; it
infuriated and mortified him. Lady Malleson knew him for what he was;
knew him for worse than he was, despised him more than he deserved. He
had to bear this, added to his loss of her; and he found it hard. Once
his angry pain drove him to write to her, as lackadaisical a letter as
he could compose, flicking at her the phrases that he had been slightly
drunk on the occasion of his last interview with her; that he apologised
for presenting himself to her in that condition, also for whatever wild
statement he might have uttered; he sent the letter; in his mind he
followed its journey; he wept bitter and angry tears on the morning when
it must be received.


                                   IV

Warily, above all, must he tickle Gregoryâ€™s suspicions.

No one knew of the system that grew up then in that house. The house was
secret enough at any time; now it contained a secret within its secret.
It contained the pursuit of Gregory by Silas, the difficult
tracking-down, the requisite, progressive measure of suggestion, the
pieces of paper bearing the poison of a phrase, the impotence of the
dumb man, his efforts to escape from his tormentor, then his return in
his cravings for a greater certainty. Silas was intent upon his own
skill; a touch here, a touch there; he placed them with a sharp and
delicate artistry. His only fear now was that Gregory might refuse to go
with Calthorpe, and to forestall that danger he got hold of the
overseer.

I hope, Mr. Calthorpe, youâ€™ll keep Gregory to this job. You know heâ€™s
diffident,â€”to look at the way he sticks to those vats, he whoâ€™s fit to
manage the engine room!â€”and now heâ€™s saying that youâ€™re wanting him to
go out of charity, like, and if he thinks that, he wonâ€™t be beholden to
you.

Iâ€™ll go in to him now, and fix it up once for all. Thereâ€™s no charity
about the matter; I donâ€™t want Gregory to _talk_ to the plants, I want
him to _look_ at them.

I knew I only had to mention it to you, said Silas demurely.


                                   V

Gregory was torn. He was bitterly unwilling to forego the chance offered
to his solitary ambition. He was forty-five, and he had given the whole
of his youth to the patient, meticulous study of machinery; could he
decline the chance, on the strength of a few words from Silas,â€”roguish,
busy old Silas! always meddling at something, never letting well aloneâ€”a
few words that perhaps were rooted in nothing but Silasâ€™s imagination?
No, he couldnâ€™t decline it! But what if Silas were right? Nan was young,
Morgan was young, he constantly saw them talking together, talking when
Nan should have been working and when Morgan, more naturally, might have
been kicking a ball with other young men on the green. Here he became
full of gloom. Should he charge Nan with it? no, women were too artful;
he would learn nothing through charging Nan. Better to trust Silas, then
by the time he came back from Birmingham Silas could tell him as a sure
fact whether or no.... For the first time he began to think of the
consequences, of the obligation that might be laid upon him....
Perfectly honest, he envisaged facts unflinchingly, in the sole light
under which they offered themselves to him. He was not a man to admit
alternatives.

He had only one slight hesitation: was it fair to lay a trap for Nan?
But he discarded the doubt. If she were innocent no trap could catch
her; if she were guilty, he had the right to protect his interests as
best he might; he and Silas both had that right. They were both
handicapped; their whole lives were, in some measure, the lives of
animals at bay.


                                   VI

He spent the interval before his departure in making observations for
himself, prowling round when he might least be expected, entering his
house, suddenly and noiselessly, or even looking in through the
window,â€”which, being tall, he could do with ease,â€”and sometimes on these
occasions he saw Nan and Morgan together, talking, in the midst of their
occupations, but he never saw more than that. To see them talking was,
however, a source of exasperation to him; he fancied that the most
tender words were passing between them under his very eyes, an affront,
an outrage, that drove him to gnaw his finger-tips in the same way that
Silas did, and to fly the house lest his black looks should arouse their
vigilance. His behaviour became wild and unaccountable. When he was
alone with Nan, he turned roughly demonstrative, while behind his
caresses lay the intention of finding out whether she would wince. It
was all too clear to him that she did wince. More than once he was upon
the point of questioning her, and again upon the point of refusing to
leave with Calthorpe, but he crushed these impulses. If he remained, he
might never know, so wily and circumspect would they be; if he went,
they would throw off much of their caution before blind Silas. Silas was
a good watch-dog, who in ten days would nose out certainty. To the
suspense of those ten days Gregory would expose himself; a martyrdom
which he undertook in the bleak spirit of a martyr, grimly, without
heroics, in the stern desire to win truth at the cost of pain.

She wincedâ€”oh yes! she winced. She turned away from him, said he
bothered her, kept herself unnecessarily busy. The more she evaded him,
the less willing was he to leave her alone; he followed her when she
fled into the scullery, and with a gasp she became aware of his silent
presence as his hands were laid from behind upon her shoulders. This was
a persecution worse than the verbal persecution she had endured from
Silas! She prayed ardently and with terror for the day when he should
go. The ten daysâ€™ reprieve stretched luminous as a lifetimeâ€”but even
then there would be Silas, Silas honeyed again, when, all her wits cried
to her, he was fifty times more dangerous. She thought that without
Linnet she would have become truly distracted; yet even to Linnet, at
home, she dared not speak overmuch. She could have kissed the forewoman
of her department who again sent her to his room with a message.


                                  VII

She knocked at his door with no less timidity than she had done the
first time, her hand clasping her beating heart. His voice called Come
in!; she slipped in; his dim room and the shining alembics were lovely
and mysterious, like a fairy-story, after the chill of the bare
linoleum-lined passage she had just followed. In a moment they were
close to one another, their fingers wove together without knowing how it
had so come about; the fact of being unexpectedly alone came like a
draught of water to the thirsty.

I hate that passage leading to your roomâ€”itâ€™s like a prison, she
murmured, raising her hand to his bright hair; it so cool and dim in
here; I wish, oh, how I wish I could work in here helping you.

It might be arranged ... he began enviously.

Oh no, she said, shaking her head, we mustnâ€™t think of it.

Weâ€™re never really alone, he said.

No.

They looked at each other gravely and pitifully.

It does seem so hard, her small voice took up again, that you and I,
who have never done any harm, should be spied on and hunted, because
thatâ€™s what I feel: hunted. We havenâ€™t done any harm, have we? only in
our thoughts, that is, she amended, scrupulous, and even then I donâ€™t
think itâ€™s terrible harm to wish we might sometimes be alone. I try not
to wish for more than that, Linnet; I do indeed. You mustnâ€™t come so
close to me, please, and she put out her hand to push him away a
little.

Why mustnâ€™t I?

You know quite well: I canâ€™t bear your nearness.

Nan, you are the most provoking mixture of frankness and prudery....

I donâ€™t mean to be. I came straight to you when I got into the room,
because I was happy and forgetful, but I am sorry; that wasnâ€™t
encouraging you to behave as I want you to behave. You know what I tell
you: we can _talk_, no more.

But talk can lay up trouble too, you know, Nan.

Her face took on a startled look, as a dismayed childâ€™s.

What! do you mean we ought to give that up too? Oh, no, Linnet, I
couldnâ€™t bear that, indeed I couldnâ€™t; you mustnâ€™t suggest it.

Of course I donâ€™t suggest it; is it likely? Only I think you trick
yourself into believing what you want to believe, and if your conscience
does prick you, you try to salve itâ€”and I dare say succeedâ€”by imposing
some quite hypocritical limitation.

Are you laughing at me or not? Or are you serious? do you mean that I
ought not to see you at all or talk to you? perhaps you are right....

Nan, you are too perverse! I only mean that if you allow yourself to
talk to me, and allow me to talk to you, and to make love to you, you
might consistently allow me to go further, to take your hand, for
instance, without pushing me away when I stand quite respectfully beside
you.

I see what you mean; I canâ€™t argue, but I think, please, I would rather
go on in the same way as before.

Very well, he said ruefully.

And why do you say â€˜make loveâ€™? she harked back after a little. As
though it were just a way of spending the time? Anyway, I think I would
rather you did not; we can talk quite well without that, and then you
need not think I am hypocritical.

You do keep me in order, Nan, donâ€™t you? he said.

No, I am often very weak and cowardly.

You are only cowardly when you wonâ€™t face what is to become of us, he
replied, with more seriousness.

Again she looked startled.

Oh, please, Linnet, I donâ€™t like talking about that.

Well, but, my dear, he said, you know quite well that we cannot go on
indefinitely as we are at present; you ought to be the first to realise
it, with your scrupulous mind always splitting hairs and dwelling on
niceties. If it were light come, light go, between usâ€”there a kiss and
here an arm round youâ€”it would be different. But you know it is not like
that. It is perhaps your very prudery that puts the whole thing on a
different footing. Anyway you know that it is a matter of all our
lives....

Yes, it is, isnâ€™t it? she said, with a contented sigh, and leaning up
against him.

Nan, you distract me! he exclaimed, I say that it is for all our
lives, and you murmur with pleasure, as though the whole thing were
thereby settled. In the meantime I am neither one thing nor the other; I
am neither your friend, nor your husband, nor your lover.

Oh, but you are surely....

Well, what am I? I wish I knew!

My lover, she said in a low voice.

Nan, donâ€™t hang your head so; for pityâ€™s sake donâ€™t; you are too
charming when you do it. No, I am not your lover ... worse luck....

But you do love me, donâ€™t you?

Good God, do you doubt it?

Well, you never say so. You never said it. Silas had to say it for
you.

But Iâ€™ve said so since.

Oh ... _since!_ she said.

But, my darling Nan, a little way back you forbade me to speak of love
to you.

Yes, you see, she said with another sigh, less contented, this one, I
want to have nothing on my conscience, nothing, nothing, nothingâ€”except
my thoughts, and I canâ€™t help those.

Wonâ€™t you tell them to me?

If I told them to you, they would be on my conscience, and thatâ€™s where
I donâ€™t want them to be.

You are deplorably logical, when it is for my undoing, he said,
sighing in his turn.

If I had a laden conscience, I should become a coward. If I became a
coward, I should never have the courage to face Gregory, she said,
checking the points off on her fingers. No, stop: I know what youâ€™re
about to say, â€˜then you do mean some day to face Gregory.â€™ I canâ€™t
answer that, and you must be patient to let these ten days go by; maybe
by the time weâ€™re in the middle of them I will have got back my wits.
Iâ€™m too scared now to have any wits at all. What is going on in our
house now? you know no more than I do, and yet you know just as I do
that there is something strange. Itâ€™s something between Silas and
Gregory. Oh, itâ€™s dreadful to think that there should be something
between them which they are working out for themselves, with all their
difficulties, because they canâ€™t ask _our_ help, either yours or mine.
It frightens me so. Oh, my dear, itâ€™s horrible to be afraid! Linnet, you
must take care of me.

You donâ€™t give me much chance....

No, I know I donâ€™t; Iâ€™m bad to you, I know. I seem to turn this way and
that for a way out, and things press upon me, and then I make you suffer
for it. Put it down that I scarcely know what Iâ€™m doing....

No, I know you donâ€™t, my pretty, my poor pretty, only tell me about it,
if thatâ€™s any help, and donâ€™t let things get magnified in your mind
bigger than they ought to be; hills look steeper than they are, you
know, before one starts going up them.

Oh, she said, her eyes brimming, youâ€™re good and patient, indeed you
are. I hardly understand, yet, whatâ€™s come over us, that sometimes my
breath comes short and I shut my eyes and think I must faint away with
the longing to see you. I wish, sometimes I wish that something would
happenâ€”something quite outside this life, I mean,â€”to relieve us; I donâ€™t
know what I mean, rightly. But itâ€™s the weight ... and the longing ... I
canâ€™t keep still under it, at times; I have to get up and move about ...
the longing ... the burning. She put her hand up to her throat as
though she were physically oppressed. And I put questions to
myselfâ€”about you, I meanâ€”and the answers come springing without my
having to think. They leap out, the answers do. Would I die for you? Oh,
so gladly! would I starve for you? yes, and never a word to let you
know. Would I die if you died? Iâ€™d pine if I lived an hour after youâ€™d
gone. Would I give myself up to you? yesâ€”to beat me if you chose; Iâ€™d
shut my eyes and let you.... Thatâ€™s love, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s like striking a
bell; it clangs back at once. And nowâ€”I canâ€™t help saying itâ€”for ten
days thereâ€™ll be times when weâ€™re alone, and Iâ€™ll be less starved than I
am now; it seems Iâ€™ve just been keeping alive for this, and reach it all
spent and gasping. Oh, nothing, nothing more! only to talk to you, and
look at you; weâ€™re strangers still. I want to _drink_ being with you.
Then Iâ€™ll be able to think, and weâ€™ll sort everything out, and get it
clear. Only now Iâ€™m too parched for you, and too frightened of _them_.
You must decide everything for me, and tell me what to do, and then take
me away,â€”oh, take me away!

She clung to him as she besought him, abandoning herself like a
frightened child, and putting her arms up round his neck exactly like a
child.

My God, I didnâ€™t know you could speak so, or feel so. _I_ felt so, but
I didnâ€™t dare to tell you.

I didnâ€™t know either ... one doesnâ€™t know.... She had sunk so
unrestrainedly against him, that but for his support she would have
slipped down without resistance upon the floor. He felt that she would
lie there, like a shot bird, at his feet, making no effort to rise, and
letting her will glide away from her in a passive extinction of self; it
would be for her the most exquisite, and at the same time the most
spiritually voluptuous experience of her life. As it was, she had never
known anything like the wild, fainting rapture of this half-surrender.
Linnet, Linnet, she said, pushing him away, where are we? it wonâ€™t
do; weâ€™re being swept along; Iâ€™m afraid. Go right over there, to the
other side of the room; no, farther away than that. She directed him
with an imperious urgent finger. You mustnâ€™t come any nearer. Promise.
Sit down on that chair. Iâ€™ll stop over here. She leant her head back
against the wall.

Now we couldnâ€™t well be farther apart, he said, having obeyed her.
They were both pale as they looked at one another across the width of
the room, and their breath came and went quickly between their parted
lips.

Itâ€™s to be like this the whole time that Gregory is away. Then when he
comes back I can tell him everything. If we had been different, I should
tell him less easily.

Morgan was just able to follow the ethics of this argument.

Now Iâ€™m going away, she continued; you mustnâ€™t move. If you moved, I
should run to you....

Oh, Nan! he said, stretching out his hands to her across the room.

No, no, no, she cried, vigorously shaking her head from side to side,
the shake becoming more vigorous as her need for determination
increased. Oh, my darling heart, she cried, I want so to come to
you, and she fled from the room, leaving him unbalanced and perplexed,
and in half a dozen minds as to whether he ought to submit as he did to
her directions, or to take the law away from her by adopting a bolder
course.




                                  XIII


                                   I

She lay still asleep in her bed while Gregory prepared himself for his
journey. He trod in stockinged feet upon the boards of the bedroom,
throwing articles of clothing into a carpet bag, and stopping to glance
at his wife who, with her hair loose on the pillow around her small
face, looked like some fragile child, and like a childâ€™s too was the
shape of her limbs beneath the thin covering of blanket. She lay
sleeping; her lips parted. Gregory had purposely not roused her. It was
her undoubted business to go downstairs, light the fire, and get him
some breakfast, but he would forego the meal sooner than watch her
moving about the house he was that day abandoning. He did not wish to
carry away the picture of her at her familiar tasks, in which, he
imagined, she would so soon be watched by another. In his fancy he
pictured Morgan entering the house as soon as he, Gregory, had safely
left it. Would they breakfast delightedly together? or would the fear of
Silas counsel prudence? Again, as many times before, he was upon the
point of renouncing his journey. He looked at Nan with his fists
clinched, a storm of hatred and possession tearing him. His placid
inward life, running as smoothly as the machines with which it was
always occupied, had been disturbed lately, disturbed with a violence he
would not have suspected; he was troubled and resentful, directing his
resentment particularly against Nan who had brought this disturbance
upon him. He glared at her as she lay asleep. He thought angrily that he
should be allowed to live as a privileged designer of engines, not drawn
into the fury of domestic calamity. His nature, once roused, held
elements so harsh and intolerant, he knew, that it fitted him all too
well for a part in such a calamity. Had he been aloof, indifferent ...
ah! how he coveted that gift of indifference. He had it not; he was too
much of a Dene. So he dressed himself, packed his bag, and brooded
resentment over Nan. She slept on; breathing softly; unconscious.

He was ready, but for his coat. He stood in his shirt sleeves looking at
Nan and wondering whether he should wake her or slip away to the station
with no farewell. Then he bent down and slid his arm beneath the pillow,
lifting her bodily towards him. She woke with a cry, to find Gregoryâ€™s
face near hers as he knelt on the floor. It was very fortunate that he
could not hear the cry, which, at first merely startled, changed to
horror as she recognised him. His sardonic smile and her widened eyes
were terribly close; their two faces, by reason of their nearness,
seemed large to one another. She pushed with both hands against his
chest, struggling silently; only half awake, she had not the wisdom not
to struggle; now, she knew only his distastefulness. He held her,
hardened to a cold fury by her resistance. He could see all her muscles
exerted in the effort to get rid of him; even the corners of her mouth
were drawn tight, and her eyes were fixed on him in concentration. She
could not plead with him, as she could have with another man; their
strife must be soundless; she pushed, and twisted herself within his
grasp, both quite in vain, then, relaxing, she lay quiet, with his arm
still beneath her. She stared up at him. She knew, and was terrified by,
the expression in his eyes. He drew his hand from beneath her and
sketched a rapid phrase on his fingers, at the same time moving towards
her. She answered vehemently in the same manner, her arms pitifully
slight and delicate as the loose nightgown fell back from them, and the
fingers racing in gesticulation. His whole face darkened as he read; she
saw that an angry obstinacy was taking possession of him. She tried to
escape from the opposite side of her bed, but he seized her again,
holding her down, determined, revengeful, and unshaken by pity. She
sought wildly in her mind for some means of release, finding none, when
she heard Calthorpeâ€™s voice calling for Gregory beneath the window.


                                   II

She was saved, he had gone, flinging on his coat and snatching his
carpet-bag, but for long she remained trembling and fearing his return.
She shuddered at intervals as she remembered their struggle, conducted
in that horrible silence; their antagonism had been so condensed; none
of it could slip away in words. She could still feel where his fingers
had gripped into her flesh. If Calthorpe had not come! Now, now, they
were on the road to Spalding; she was alone in the house, she was to
breakfast with Silas and Linnet. Her shudders of horror gave place to
the sweet shivering she knew when she thought of Linnet, an etherealised
desire, a trembling of her spirit more than of her body, a going out
towards a young and fit companion, who by a refinement of perfection was
also a lover. Gradually she ceased to think of Gregory, and lost herself
in the other thought, lying propped up on her pillow with an unconscious
smile of heavenly happiness in her eyes and upon her lips. She rose
presently, and in the same dream started to dress, delighting in the
touch of the cold water she splashed over her throat and arms. The
puritanical neatness of each garment, and the fibre of her laundered
linen, likewise satisfied her as she became clothed. She had noticed
how, without any exaggeration of fancy, small physical experiences were
intensified of late,â€”colours were brighter, the song of birds more
ringing, her flesh more sensitive to the touch, and in looking at people
she had observed how the pores of their skin were distinct, or the firm
planting of eyelashes, and sweep of eyebrow,â€”all these things, that were
foolishly unimportant, but that added a vividness to daily life. She was
in every detail more keenly alive; her nostrils dilated to smell the
air, and she touched the sill of the window, where the wood was faintly
warm under the sun, with a sense of comradeship. She moved, too, with a
difference; her tread became resilient; her foot was springy as it
poised upon the ground. Her small head carried itself with a light
elasticity in the air, and she was actually conscious of the soft mass
of her hair that caressed the nape of her neck as she turned her head.
She had a wish for woods and cornlands; to sit in the roots of a tree
beside a brook, allowing the water to eddy between her staying fingers;
to bathe her body in a lake or in the surf of the sea. So, in loving one
man, one loved the whole company of earth? Love was illimitable indeed,
if it conferred that privilege, a wider thing than mere absorption in a
fellow-being that was a creature, after all, of limitations as narrow as
any other.


                                  III

They were alone, the three of them, the absence of Gregory so
startlingly unprecedented that despite Silasâ€™s presence she obtained a
foretaste of complete and sudden solitude with Linnet. She was admitted,
she, the starved, to a feast of dominion. She found herself translated
into a world where she, most marvellously, was the object of reverence
and solicitude, and under this warmth of spoiling her natural grace
expanded even beyond the anticipation of his delight. Aware that those
ten days were but a reprieve, she gave herself up to making the most of
them,â€”in so far as was consistent with the narrow rulings of her
conscience. Linnet, exasperated at times, but ruefully submissive
always, acknowledged and obeyed her imperious orders. She was very happy
in her control of him; all the happier, perhaps in the knowledge that
she owed it solely to the consent of his chivalry, without which (O
exquisite danger!) her security would, like glass, be shivered.

There was, unforgettably, Silas. Silas proclaiming himself a friend,
but, nevertheless, remaining a spy, a jailer. Silas who seemed to come
upon them with a queer noiselessness; who cried, Well? over their
shoulders, and who then, suddenly swooping down upon them, swept with
his hands to learn whether they were sitting close together, or apart.
They were always apart. Angered, he would say, Well? again, this time
with a forced benevolence in his voice; and sometimes he would amuse
himself by walking along between them, hilarious, taking an arm of each.
This method of surprising them, this sham benevolence, this reasonless
hilarity, struck cold terror into Nan as something indefinably sinister.
Once, too, when she met Silas tapping his way over the cobbles towards
the letter-box, on the envelope which he carried in his hand she read
the name and address of Gregory. (Silas had adapted with delight this
method of communication. He rubbed his hands together when he thought of
Gregory, in Birmingham, tearing the flap open and scanning the lines of
those able, indefinite letters.) But at other times she was puzzled by
the hungry interest with which he questioned her, and in which her ear
did not detect the usual unalloyed malignity, but rather a wistfulness,
a desire to be admitted to a lovely secret, a genuine craving for
participation, however humble, however incomplete, and beggarly upon the
fringe of riches. At such times an eagerness crept into his face, as he
bent forward to question her, his hands hanging loosely interlaced
between his knees, the strong cords of his throat standing out in
sculptural masses of light and shadow; words came from him almost
timidly, as though he feared to presume or to give offence, but must
nevertheless urge his examination, irresistibly tempted and allured.
Nan, who sat sewing, looked into his face with wonderment. Experience
taught her mistrust, but instinct taught her a heart-searching pity.
There was always that same feeling which she had for Silas, which she
could not explain, and which nothing,â€”no dread, no premonition, no
knowledge,â€”could permanently destroy. It reawakened always at the sound
of his yearning voice. Once it led her to put her fingers on his
forehead, How much youâ€™ve missed!

He sprang away, detected at the very moment when forgetful absorption
had suspended his defiance.

Iâ€™ve had all I wanted. Make no mistake. Youâ€™re wasting your sloppy
pity....


                                   IV

Gregory had been so suddenly and so completely withdrawn! She adapted
herself without bewilderment to the new order. She became as a girl,
betrothed to Linnet. Their relationship had all the innocence of a
betrothal. Her past life might have been blotted out, the future so far
distant (down a vista of ten days!) as to be, for all practical
purposes, negligible. She could have drawn from this a proof that the
violence of the years lived between Gregory and Silas had made upon her
being only a mark such as might be soon effaced. She, the true Nan, had
slipped away from violence, because violence was so unalterably alien to
her. The lesson of violence was a lesson she might provisionally learn,
but would never long remember. She went out now to meet the condition
she had always wanted: the secure tenderness, the settlement, once and
for all, in her choice; she was not one who would demand variety upon
the face of existence. Variety! she had had it; excitement, uncertainty,
passion, and the weight of failure all around her, reckless because
resigned; she had had all that, compressed within the limits of an iron
circle; those were not the things she wanted. The things she wanted were
the things that Linnet could give her.

The subtle sarcasms of Silas were incapable of troubling her quiet
discernment.




                                  XIV


                                   I

Their last afternoon, a Saturday. They believed that Gregory was to
return at seven; only Silas knew that he was to return at five. With the
hoarding instinct that this knowledge might be useful to him, he kept it
a secret. They were very silent, and remained close to one another,
holding hands. How grave they were! They were very self-contained,
husbanding all their strength. He knew that they meant to beard Gregory
that evening, but he, Silas, equally, meant to outwit them, and he
thought with satisfaction that his cunning was greater than theirs. He
considered their silence with an irony more tragic than any of them
knew. The pain that their company had cost him during the last ten days;
the pain, too, which his own desire for their happiness had cost him;
his angry, resentful love for them both; the strain of remaining true to
his principles, and his vindictiveness (Christine! Christine! always
Christine, recurrent, gnawing,) all this mingled in his mind to a state
of folly with which he was almost unable prudently to deal. He
acknowledged that he had been partly to blame. He had drawn out Nanâ€™s
confidences. But his temperament inclined him harshly towards
self-flagellation....

Only a little time now, Nan, before heâ€™s here, he said. Youâ€™ll have
much to tell him, much thatâ€™ll interest him. Remember, if you want any
help, Iâ€™m here: Silas is here. Him being my brother, we understand one
another, like you and Linnet understand one another. Blood brothers is
close like lovers. Close as lovers.â€”But what call have I to talk of
love, seeing I never knew it, nor wanted it?

He went outside and sat on the doorstep, leaning his back against the
closed door. The village street was deserted, distant voices sounded
from the green; in the faint warmth of the April sun the paint of the
door smelt hot, and flies buzzed stickily in the corners of the
woodwork. Silas sat there clasping his knees, and swaying slightly to
the ironical rhythm of his own thoughts. He felt like a jailer, keeping
those two imprisoned inside; they were happy, in spite of the imminent
crisis; merely and childishly happy because they were together,â€”that
sufficed; he had learnt during those ten days the perfection of their
happiness. Nan had betrayed, under his questionings, more than she had
probably intended to betray, and under the pain of defrauded envy he had
accumulated a store of knowledge. They seemed to _be_ one another; it
was not so much sympathy that they enjoyed, as identity. Silas swayed
himself slowly backwards and forwards; he put the tip of his tongue
between his teeth and held it there; he tapped his boots softly together
because of his enjoyment. They were inside, talking; Gregory would be
home soon. It tickled Silasâ€™s fancy to think he had a surprise up his
sleeve in store for them; he, the unwanted third! he, the ostracised of
the village! they would soon learn, all of them, that he still had
fangs. He strained his ears to catch the first sound of the train,
which, after stopping at Spalding, crossed the fenny country at some
little distance. He wished for the dulled rumble indicative that the
train was upon its journey and therefore that Gregory and Calthorpe were
upon their way to Abbotâ€™s Etchery along the dyke, but at the same time
he wished this hour prolonged, an hour so entirely after his own heart.
He had so many revenges to take, so many old debts to wipe off, that no
luxury of procrastination could be too great. Provided only, indeed,
that the completion was sufficient, and sufficiently inevitable; and as
to this he had no misgivings.

He never heard the train. He continued to hear only the distant shouts
from the green, the small noises of insects, and the murmur within the
roomâ€”not a continued murmur, only an intermittent oneâ€”and the first
sound that drew him from his torpor of satisfaction was that of
footsteps on the cobbles and Calthorpeâ€™s voice, in its somewhat
irritatingly cheery tones, Friend Silas! well, Iâ€™ve brought back
Gregory safe and sound, and how are you all at home?

Gregory stood planted in the middle of the street watching his brotherâ€™s
face for his greeting of Calthorpe. His throat heaved, and his
suppressed violence, which was entirely apparent, made his stiff black
travelling suit and bowler hat seem puerile and ridiculous. He was in
one of those primitive moods when civilised trappings become laughable:
an angry man in a bowler hat.... Not only angry, but convulsed with
anxiety, and with a rage that prayed only to be released. Yes, even
though that rage must destroy his soul, it craved for an outlet. A man
so minded would not have thanked the reassuring speech that drove back
the straining rage as unwarrantable. The bag he carried was as paper in
his hand. His limbs seemed to burst out of his clothes; strong muscle
impatient for nakedness. His throat reared itself out of his collar. His
hands protruded starkly from his cuffs. Civilisation upon him was as
preposterous as the naked man wrestling beneath was superb. He stood
with his feet planted wide apart, in the attitude of one who awaits and
encourages an attack.

Silas was petulant at being taken by surprise; I didnâ€™t expect you, he
said, as though he had been cheated of his due. Well, now that weâ€™re
here, let us come in, said Calthorpe, still good-humoured, but slightly
uneasy; he would have liked the numbers increased, not fancying the part
of sole interpreter between the brothers; was he to act as light to the
one, and as sound to the other? The constant companionship of Gregory,
and, above all, the railway journey that day, and the walk along the
dyke, had convinced him that all was very far from well amongst the
Denes. No, said Silas, standing up and stretching his arms
crucifix-wise across the door, you canâ€™t go in there.

Gregory saw the gesture, which was intelligible enough, although he did
not hear the words. A perverse relief swept over him, at having his
worst dread confirmed. A horrible inarticulate noise broke from him,
which made Calthorpe swing round in his direction. Good God, said
Calthorpe appalled, itâ€™s like a baboon, and he continued to stare,
expecting the noise to be repeated. Silas, too, had heard; Yesâ€”like a
brute, he said, becoming transfigured with delight as he saw the
certainty of manÅ“uvring that brute with the cunning of his own
intellect. Gregory never uttered a sound unless he was extraordinarily
moved. Tell him, Mr. Calthorpe, said Silas, that he canâ€™t go into my
cottage.

He wants to know why, said Calthorpe, having delivered this message
and received the answer from Gregoryâ€™s quivering fingers. He looks as
though he might spring upon you at any moment, Silas. He watched,
anxiously, first one and then the other.

Gathering himself together, is he?

Yesâ€”he doesnâ€™t look as though heâ€™d hold himself in much longer. Oh, you
wouldnâ€™t chuckle if you could see him.

Tell him to trust me and not to be a fool.

He says, was it true?

Tell him first, that he must let me manage things.

I donâ€™t like the look of this, Silas; Iâ€™m all in the dark.

Never mind, sir; you just tell him to trust me.

Heâ€™ll be at your throat if I donâ€™t, and the communication passed
silently from Calthorpe to Gregory. He says he will trust you a bit
longer, but he wants to see things for himself.

Silas appeared to be perplexed by his brotherâ€™s impatience, and by the
danger of Calthorpe putting two and two together.

Ask him if he will wait till to-morrow, he said, at length.

This suggestion so enraged Gregory that he leapt at his brother and was
only warded off by Calthorpeâ€™s appeasing gesture. He fell back a pace,
and framed a message with shaking hands.

He says, said Calthorpe, that he will be damned if he waits another
five minutes. And I am damned myself, Silas, added the honest
instrument, if I understand a word of this, or if I will go on letting
you make a catâ€™s-paw of me for your black tricks. Call Mrs. Dene, who
perhaps knows what you are up to.

Silas was outwardly calm, but alert. He must lose no time in breaking up
the trio.

I shall explain everything to you, Mr. Calthorpe, he said earnestly,
still standing with his arms flung wide across the door, but heâ€™s a
dangerous man, my brother. Heâ€™s in a dangerous temper. To tell you the
truth, Mr. Calthorpe, he ran on with extreme glibness, he suspects
some one of tampering with his designsâ€”but keep that for yourself. Iâ€™ve
got the proofs inside my cottage, only I didnâ€™t expect you so early. We
must get him away. Tell him to go into his own place and change his
clothes, and Iâ€™ll send his wife to him.

Well, there seems to be no harm in that, said Calthorpe dubiously.

Believe me, sir, Iâ€™m acting for the best.

Hâ€™mâ€”you seem mighty eager to get your brother out of the way.

Surely you only have to look at him, Mr. Calthorpe.

Calthorpe looked, and, having done so, he asked Gregory to go. But I am
damned if I understand, he said again, taking off his hat and
scratching his head. You Denes are hard fellows to make out, he added
in an access of irritation, seeing the expression on Silasâ€™s face, and
indeed he felt that his irritation was only small and petulant beside
the anger of Gregory and the sardonic malevolence of Silas. If it were
not for Nan, he would wash his hands of the whole lot of them. His
easy-going philosophy of life was too greatly disturbed by the stress
and inexplicable ferment of the Denes. He saw Gregory scowling in his
indecision, than a message came from the able fingers, which he passed
on to Silas. He says he will wait for his wife in his own cottage.

Tell him she shall join him there, said Silas grimly.


                                   II

Devastation met Nanâ€™s eyes when she hurried into her cottage. The white
lace curtains were torn from the windows and the pictures lay scattered
about the floor. Any ornament or attempt at decoration had been snatched
from its place and flung across the room. In the midst of this wreckage
stood Gregory, in his shirt sleeves, his chest heaving and his bronze
forehead shining with sweat. He held out to Nan a paper upon which he
had written, _Plain deel tables and chairs is good enough for us,
without fal-lals._ She read it, and with tears running over her cheeks
knelt down to gather up her broken china, collecting the pieces tenderly
into the shreds of the curtains. Gregory came towards her and kicked the
things away from her hand. She knelt upon the floor, gazing up at him
without protest but with inexpressible sorrow. Every time she renewed
her gesture of gathering up the shares, he scattered them again by a
kick, until in discouragement she desisted, waiting for his next
manifestation. She dared not get up while he stood over her in his
threatening attitude.

Silas came in; Nan found herself turning to him as towards a friend.
Here, at least, was one who had some influence over Gregory! She felt
herself the alien before the brothers.

Silas was sympathetic. Silas commiserated. Let her go away for a little,
and he would soothe Gregory. Gregory had behaved like a peevish child.
He, Silas, would remonstrate. He even patted Nanâ€™s shoulder kindly as
she passed him, drying her eyes, to leave the brothers together as she
was bid.




                                   XV


                                   I

It was not long before she returned, and saw Silas alone, with the
wreckage created by Gregoryâ€™s rage still around him.

Silas! she exclaimed, going up to him, whereâ€™s Gregory?â€”whereâ€™s
Linnet?

You ask for them in the same breath? he replied.

But I must know! she said, catching hold of his arm and peering
urgently into his face. Silas, what dreadful excitement is making you
so quiet, so strung-up like? Donâ€™t think that I canâ€™t see it. Youâ€™re
gathered all into yourself, like as though you were waiting, and your
face looks so strange. Silas! you are in a trance? For pityâ€™s sake,
speak to me. If you wonâ€™t speak, I must go. I canâ€™t stop here. Iâ€™m going
outâ€”to look for them both. Only, if you can tell me aught, wonâ€™t you do
so, Silas? you could if you would, Iâ€™m sure, and Iâ€™m so broken by
terror, Silas, if you can help me now youâ€™ll surely not refuse?

The sinner must expect to pay, he said slowly, his eyes wide open and
glazed into impassivity.

But I havenâ€™t sinned, God be my judge! she cried, wringing her hands
together. Silas, I do conjure you, as you hope for mercy yourself, let
your lips speak; tell meâ€”for you knowâ€”where theyâ€™ve gone, and why? Tell
me where I can find them. Oh, if I were there, I could come between
them, and if Gregory must injure me, why, then, he must, but I should
_know_, I should know; itâ€™s this doubt, this knowing that theyâ€™re
together, this not knowing what they may be saying! it kills me, Silas.
Silas, see here, listen to me, Silas: Iâ€™ve not been bad to you, have I,
Silas? Weâ€™ve not been bad to you, Linnet and I? Well, have a little
mercy on us now: weâ€™ve loved, yes, but weâ€™ve done no more wrong than
that. I wouldnâ€™t, with Gregory away. We were to tell Gregory everything,
so soon as he came back. You know that, Silas.â€”Oh, youâ€™ll not help me: I
see it by your face. What are you thinking of? I never saw you look so
terrible. But I havenâ€™t time to beseech you more; I must go, and take my
chance of finding them, and may your wicked heart be afraid for whatever
goes amiss.

Youâ€™ll not go, he said suddenly, holding her down.

She struggled against him.

Silas, you hurt my wrist; let go, I say. Oh, I see it: youâ€™re in with
Gregory, youâ€™ve tricked us; my God, what can Linnet and I do against you
and Gregory?â€”You laugh at that, you fiend, she said, quietening into
despair; you laugh, she said, rocking her head piteously from side to
side, you laugh, you laugh!

Gregoryâ€™s honest, he pronounced; Iâ€™ve got three of you, not two, in
the net. Gregoryâ€™s my dupe too; heâ€™s an honest man.

But, then, why? in Godâ€™s name, _why_? what is it, Silas? are you mad or
sane? Are we to be your toys? What have we done to you? What had Hannah
done?

Hannah?...

You killed Hannah.

He still held her down on a chair, and by the high standard of their
present stress the retrospective admission that he had killed Hannah
seemed to them both subordinate. He was breathing heavily.

Hannah laughed at me and fooled me; she was rough with me, and
sweet-tongued enough with other men. I wasnâ€™t going to be fooled by
Hannah. Sheâ€™d thrown in her lot with mine, and if I suffered she should
suffer too. Thatâ€™s why I killed Hannah. The worldâ€™s been made black for
me; Iâ€™ll make it black for others.

Itâ€™s awful, your revengefulness.... But I tried to make it _less_
black, Silas, so did Linnet; look, I donâ€™t ask you now to help me, or to
tell me anything, but only to let me go,â€”wonâ€™t you, Silas? Itâ€™s so easy
for you to keep me here; I canâ€™t escape from your strength if youâ€™re
determined to hold me. But I beg you; I beseech you. Often you tried me
high, and if I failed you I ask your forgiveness. Only let me go now.
Donâ€™t _help_ me; I donâ€™t ask that; only give me the chance of helping
myself. I ask with all the patience and humbleness in me; Iâ€™m in bitter
anguish, Silas. Gregoryâ€™s hard enough, Heaven knows, but heâ€™s got the
heart of a woman next to you.

Gregoryâ€™s less bereft than I; I only have my own mind to feed upon.

Surely thatâ€™s true of us all, blind or not blind? she said, in a weak
attempt at argument.

Then I was born with a darkened mind, not only with darkened eyes, he
exclaimed violently, and with renewed determination. Iâ€™m cursed with
the one as much as with the other, and though God knows no justice Iâ€™ll
throw in my quota to balance the scales: I never deserved the curse I
got, but, since I got it, Iâ€™ll deserve it; and Iâ€™ll see to it that
others get something they donâ€™t deserve, as I did myself. Did you ever
consider what blindness meant? To be dependent on othersâ€™ charity, to be
a burden, a maimed thing? above all to have to submit to pity, when you
were born with a spirit that wanted the _envy_ of other men?

Silas, Silas, all thatâ€™s just words, and meantime youâ€™re draining the
life out of me.

Youâ€™re not Nan, he said, not Nancy Dene; youâ€™re just the victim of
_my_ curse. What does it matter that you never knew Lady Malleson?
Blind, you call me? why, I think weâ€™re all blindâ€”blind instruments, not
more blind one than the other.

Gregory only breaks my things, she cried out, kicking with her toe at
a fragment of china, but youâ€™re putting all my happiness in pieces.

Yes, said Silas, I told you he was an honest man.

Thatâ€™s why we would have put everything to him honestly, she began
with extreme earnestness; we would have told him we hadnâ€™t sought one
another out, but that something led us.... We had talked it all over,
what we would say. Silas, will nothing soften you? You talk about
courage: we meant to be brave, not deceitful; you even urged us, once,
after the fire, to hold to one another if we loved truly. You said we
were the builders; you talked beautiful. I never knew a man talk like
you talk, sometimes, Silas. You seem all lifted-up.... Maybe you
wouldnâ€™t see so bright if you didnâ€™t see so black. I had a feeling for
you; oh yes, I had! Though all the while I knew about Hannah, and after
Hannah, Martin. But I didnâ€™t know then that after Hannah and Martin it
would be me and Linnetâ€”and Linnet! You seemed kindly to us, of late. Was
it _all_ a trap? did you never _feel_ kindly while you spoke us fair?
Oh, Silas, everythingâ€™s going from me. Itâ€™ll go badly between Linnet and
Gregory. If I was there, Iâ€™d manage; you fight things as they come
along; and Linnet, he needs me to look after him. Heâ€™ll be stiff and
buttoned-up with Gregory, but thatâ€™s not the worst: itâ€™s Gregory Iâ€™m
afraid of. Not speaking, he puts everything into his fists; you know
what heâ€™s like, Silas. And Linnetâ€™s my life,â€”my life. Iâ€™m telling you
more than I ever told him, save once. Wonâ€™t you let me go? She moved
her wrist tentatively within the clench of his fingers.

I waste, I fail, said Silas, holding her wrist more closely than
before; the day you came from Sussex to Abbotâ€™s Etchery you were meant
to fall in with me. I told you already, youâ€™re not Nan Dene; youâ€™re a
thing. Youâ€™re part of my design. You, and your little loves, and dreams
and what-notâ€”Iâ€™ll _grind_ you. When I was a boy, I set out to give
people as bad a time as I had myself. My mother hated my father and was
afraid of him; he used to jeer at her when he saw how much she hated
Gregory and me. Because we were deformed, you understand. Once I was
given a rabbit for a pet; well, I put out its eyes with a needle. That
makes you shiver: I hold that it was only just. Now Iâ€™ve got you; youâ€™ll
be better game than Hannah, because that was over too quickly; but you,
once Linnet is taken away from you, and youâ€™re brought back where you
belong, to my brother, to be my brotherâ€™s wife, his faithful, broken,
submissive wifeâ€”Iâ€™ll know that every day your prettiness will wither,
youâ€™ll never sing, youâ€™ll never put out china for Gregory to break,
youâ€™ll shun young men because youâ€™ll have known the pain of love, youâ€™ll
bury your heart below a mound, and your hopes beside your heart, and so
youâ€™ll grow old between Gregory and me, and weâ€™ll speak less and less,
until you and I sit as silent as Gregory himself.

He paused, but she gave only a small moan.

You were right, he went on, Linnet is with Gregory now. I sent Linnet
off, and now Iâ€™ve sent Gregory to join him. You wonâ€™t see him again,â€”not
if I know Gregory. Gregory wonâ€™t tell us what took place between
them,â€”not he! Heâ€™ll come home presently, and youâ€™ll get our supper, and
have yours between us, and after supper Gregoryâ€™ll get out his drawings.
And every evening afterwards will be the same,â€”exactly the same. Maybe
youâ€™ll have children and watch them growing like me; you donâ€™t know,
yet, what seeds might be lying in your childrenâ€™s minds. Iâ€™d watch over
them, never fear; Iâ€™ll not have my nephews grow into milksops, into
sentimental dabs....

He spoke with such virulence that Nan cried out, unbearably slashed.
That seemed to gratify him, for he settled down into an intermittent
growl:â€”

Your children.â€”Your sons.â€”But Denes, all the same.â€”Who stands alone?
he muttered, taken up on that revived train of thought, Who stands
single? no one, it seems; your sons wouldnâ€™t be solely yours. Whereâ€™s
independence? not in this world. O folly! to let it slide, even in part,
into anotherâ€™s keeping. Where would be your trouble now, if Linnet
hadnâ€™t your heart? Freedom goes when the heart goes.â€”Not strong
enough.â€”Loneliness and labour,â€”yes, surely.

â€™Tisnâ€™t all that, â€™tis happiness you grudge, said Nan, suddenly
bitter.

Thatâ€™s your little view: there spoke Nan Dene!â€”And if you thought that,
anyway why did you flaunt your happiness in my face? Eh?

Oh, Silas, you kept asking me....

And if I did! Was it part of your kindness that you boast of, to give
me the glimpse of a feast I couldnâ€™t share? Was it meant as a treat?
Youâ€™d be willing to give me kindness; I couldnâ€™t expect more,â€”a blind
man like me. Very lucky to get as much. He roared suddenly with
laughter. Thatâ€™s a pallid sort of thing to offer,â€”I wonâ€™t give you
thanks for that, he cried.

Nan thought that he was really going mad; madness and disaster had
broken crashing over her world. The forces loosed were too great and too
bewildering for her to strive against; the sanity of Linnet, the sanity
of their joy, was lost for ever, lost, foundered in the madness of the
hurricane brought about by Silas and Gregory. For Gregory there might be
some excuse; Silas appeared to be possessed by a senseless, impersonal
fury of destruction. She thought she might as well argue with the
unleashed elements as with Silas in his bitterness and diabolical
delight. Yet life still moved, still endeavoured; and, pricked by its
promptings, she struggled,â€”

You hurt me and Linnet because we are safe to hurt; we canâ€™t hurt you
back.

Itâ€™s not true! he yelled.

She was utterly astonished at the effect she had produced.

But, Silas, she said, inspired, we all know you for a coward. We all
know your talk for bluster. Did you think we didnâ€™t know that, by now?


                                   II

She had not at first spoken tauntingly. She thought she had meant only
to pronounce the truth. Then she perceived that the truth had cut deeper
than any taunt. She was as a naked, unarmed person driven up against a
wall, that finds suddenly a blade put into their hands. She held it, but
was perplexed how best to use it. She made a thrust,â€”

All your talk is talk. It costs you nothing to ruin Linnet and me. It
cost you nothing to throw out Martin.â€”And Hannah, she whispered, and
Hannah!â€”What have you ever done that hurt yourself?

From the tremor of the hand still clutching her wrist she discovered
that he was shuddering.

You dare speak to me so? he threatened.

Hit me,â€”I canâ€™t hit back, she replied, upheld.

But he made no movement to injure her. His defeat was as complete as it
was sudden. Against his determination, which no appeal could have moved,
no bribe impressed, she had turned the sole effective weapon, his own
intrinsic weakness. There was no repair possible to a breach that had
started from the inside. She had struck down upon the rot within him and
the inner walls of his defences crumbled.


                                  III

Failing to understand what she had brought about, she sat watching him,
alarmed, perplexed, but, through her confusion, something stirred, which
might perhaps not be called hope, but which was at least removed from
the despondency of death that had lately descended upon her. He
maintained upon her wrist a grasp that had now become automatic; he sat
bent, covering his eyes with his free hand. She recognised only that he
must work his way towards his decision without interference on her part;
he was beyond such interference, and although the stealing away of time
roused her anxiety to the pitch of physical pain, she constrained
herself to wait, tense, in the knowledge that Silas passed through a
crisis no less momentous than her own. He moved his body uneasily about,
and unintelligible mumblings like groans escaped him. He fought; he
wrestled. He fixed that sightless gaze upon Nan, saying in tones of
reluctant abnegation, And am I to end so? He cried out once, startling
her by the anguish that tore his voice, Failure! failure! beaten by a
jeer! weakness beats me; poor blind Silas, poor weak Silas, couldnâ€™t
stick to his purpose even when his end was in sight! One thing was
clear, that he suffered intensely; but the complexity of his sufferings
was hopelessly beyond her comprehension. She could only wait, and,
trembling, watch. She no longer tried to free her wrist, fearing by that
mere flutter of self-assertion to recall his former mood. She tried to
pray, and her mind produced a prayer like a childâ€™s, Please, God....
His ravings had ceased, and nothing now came from him but the small
phrases that jerked themselves to the surface, after which the riot and
despair of his thoughts were again submerged. Flotsam and jetsam, he
muttered. Striking his chest, he said, Here stands Silas Dene, who
helped two children to happiness,â€”let that be my epitaph! Whereâ€™s
truth? do I know my own mind, or donâ€™t I? After these disjointed
remarks, that emerged at intervals, like milestones marking off the
painful road he was travelling, he released her and stood up. Iâ€™ll save
you yet, he pronounced. Stay you there and let me manage things my own
way. Youâ€™ve nothing to fear now,â€”once there was something to fear in me,
perhaps, but thatâ€™s a thing of the past. Thatâ€™s finished. You stay where
you are, and Iâ€™ll bring Linnet to you.

You may be too late, she said.

Iâ€™m not too late, he replied, with such certainty that she was misled
into thinking he had some inner knowledge.

He put her quite gently away from him as she tried to detain him,
pleading to be allowed to help.


                                   IV

He passed out of the house, guiding himself by his finger-tips that
brushed lightly against the doorpost. Not daring to disobey by following
him, Nan saw him thus lower himself to the doorstep, whence he set out
down the street in the direction of the factory, slipping his fingers
along the walls of the houses. She wondered whether she might venture to
follow at a distance. Inactivity seemed, in that pregnant hour,
intolerable.â€”Slowly she put her shawl over her head and stood in the
doorway holding the edges of the shawl close under her chin, and
exerting her eyes to keep pace with Silas. He strode on as though
confident in perfect vision; only that outstretched hand slipping
rapidly from house to house set any peculiar mark upon his progress. But
Nan, with a solicitude whose almost maternal quality she recognised with
a shock of dismay, thought, Heâ€™s going much too fast, for she made no
allowance for the quickening of all his instincts under the exalted
condition of his mind. She had now no enmity towards him. She was too
well-used to his violence to bear him any grudge for that, and moreover,
in her eyes, if he intervened on her behalf and Linnetâ€™s, he was
redeemed. She recognised obscurely that he had considered himself
shamed,â€”shamed to the extent of catastropheâ€”but this problem she
banished as beyond the scope of her understanding. If he would but come
to her aid and Linnetâ€™s she would accept,â€”oh, with what
thankfulness!â€”the benefit at his hands without perplexity or
investigation.

He had turned the corner, and, keeping her distance, she began to
follow.


                                   V

When the factory came in sight she realised from the absence of movement
about the buildings, that six oâ€™clock had long since struck and that the
work-people, in consequence, had left their employment for the day. The
evening shift, reduced to a minimum, would be occupied in one or two
specialised portions only,â€”in the boiler-rooms, for example, or amongst
the engines. For all practical purposes the Denes had the place to
themselves. A terrible doubt overcame her: might Silas, still, be
playing the double game? She pressed onward, dwarfed by the immense
sheds and chimneys that bulked around her. She could see Silas as he
crossed the tessellated square. He advanced with scarce more caution,
although he had now no wall to guide him, and, having no stick, held his
hand at armâ€™s length before him until some contact should bring him up
short. She had the dread that, did he but turn round, he would perceive
her. She walked on tiptoe, skirting the sheds under cover of the great
water-butts. Sick terror possessed her, and the imminence of disaster
weighed her down.

She saw Silas reach the foot of the long, outside, ladder-like stairs
that led to the upper gallery of the main building, and, setting his
feet confidently upon the iron steps, begin to climb.


                                   VI

He climbed without pause, dwindling to a small figure aloft, to Nan so
far below. She leant in collapse against a huge tarred water-butt,
pitiably undecided whether by ascending after him she would do more harm
or good. The question was of such importance to her, but its resolution
depended upon her poor unguided wisdom, and she shrank from the
responsibility. Still Silas climbed, and stood at last upon the topmost
landing, and disappeared from her view.

When he disappeared she hesitated no longer, but ran from her shelter of
concealment, and started pulling herself up on the ascent. She went up
the steep stairs, pulling hand over hand on the iron rail that served on
one side as banister. She thought that she would soon be on a level with
the black smoke floating from the chimneys. Through the perforations of
the iron steps she could see the ground below, and when she turned her
head she found that the roofs of the village had become apparent. She
had never been up this way before, but always by the inner staircase.
But Silas, of course, had chosen the more gaunt, the more perilous
method of approach.

Landings on the way up admitted to two other storeys; these she passed,
having a glimpse of machinery within. The top windows, square and bleak,
were those of the gallery,â€”Gregoryâ€™s gallery. She was upon the landing,
and slipped in through the door which had been left ajar. Everything
moved quickly now, too quickly to admit of any interference or
direction, and what would be done now would never have the chance of
being undone, nor would there be time for any reckoning or dexterity, in
the vehemence of colliding passions that listened to no argument and
were endowed with a strength beyond the reasoned energy of will.

Inside the five-hundred foot length of gallery the vats stretched away
in low regular ranks, under the even light of the flat windows,
pale-brown with dirt. The soap in the vats shifted and breathed; spat
and slithered as it boiled. Linnet lay unconscious on the ground, as
though he had been dropped there by a man surprised at his work; cast
down with no more care than a toy by some formidable strength; and
forgetful of prudence, Nan was instantly on her knees beside him. The
other two were at a little distance, obvious of all save their last
terrible combat. Speech and sight respectively denied them, a finer
understanding taught them mutual penetration. They might have been
ringed about by flames. They were alert only for one another. Kneeling
on the ground at Linnetâ€™s side, Nan kept her gaze fastened upon them: it
was to her very strange that Gregory should appear so fully aware of his
brotherâ€™s change of front. That he was aware of it, there could be no
doubt; he had set himself ready in the attitude of a wrestler awaiting
an onslaught. And Silas,â€”had heaven miraculously restored sight to
Silas, that he advanced with such slow certainty towards his brother? He
crouched, stalking him. He never once blundered against a vat.

Gregory leapt suddenly upon him, and in an instant their limbs were
locked.


                                  VII

Thus grappled, they seemed to sway as a double monster heroically
proportioned, a Herculean group against the flat light of the pale-brown
windows. So superbly matched were they in physique that they remained
almost motionless, swaying very slightly and with difficulty under the
strain of their utmost effort. That stillness and that silence
accompanying so supreme a struggle, were startling, portentous, and
unnaturally impressive, as though the contained violence within were too
mighty, too self-sufficient, to seek the relief of any visible outlet
whether of noise or movement. Their meeting was a muffled encounter of
force with force; it had not the crash of a collision. So they remained,
arrested, stirred only by that almost imperceptible rocking, until doubt
might have arisen whether they so held one another grasped with deadly
intent, or, as the likeness between them more palpably emerged, in a
brotherly welding against some danger imminent and extraneous. Their
feet yielded not at all from their original planting upon the boards,
their arms flung around one another had neither relaxed nor shifted, the
slight angle at which their bodies were bent remained the same. The
group they formed was of bronze beneath the spanning iron girders. But
indeed the question became one of endurance, while the bodyâ€™s tension,
flung on the hollowed hips, the quivering thighs, the knotted calves,
and lean ankles, strained and cracked under the sustained tautening of
human sinew. The one who was first to yield, by so much as the stagger
of a foot, would find the advantage narrowly pursued, his opponent
weighing down upon him, pressing him hard across their meagre
margin.â€”Yet, were they meeting in alliance or hostility, the two
brothers, so alike in their carved features, in the duplication of torso
and huge opposing members?

Very slowly they bent together, straining; very slowly straightened
themselves again to their formation of deadlock. All this strife took
place without a sound, and seemed to occupy a long period of time, as
though that group were permanent in the gallery, taking on the dingy
monochrome and adapting itself to the proportions of the galleryâ€™s
enormous setting. Nan, the impotent onlooker, could foresee no ending,
no outcome. She saw that Gregory stared into his brotherâ€™s face with a
concentration of hatred. There was very little to indicate the intense
pressure of strength that each was putting forth. But a difference was
creeping in,â€”certainly a difference was creeping in. Gregoryâ€™s
determination was becoming the determination of misgiving, Silasâ€™s that
of ultimate mastery. He did not appear triumphant, but quietly sure.
Throughout, he had been guided by that security of vouchsafed insight.

Nan dared not stir. She continued to kneel beside Linnet, who still lay
with his eyes closed, and the mark of a bruise blackening rapidly on his
temple. She was deeply thankful for his unconsciousness.

The other two held her eyes. Gregory shifted a foot backwards to steady
his balance; it was their first definite movement. Their faces were
close; not angry, but concentrated, and Silasâ€™s was like a cast mask of
unflinching patience. It frightened Nan to look at Silasâ€™s face, he was
so immeasurably beyond both the greatness and the smallness of things
human. He was like an incarnation of purpose, summoned for one set,
finite task. His pressure was beginning to tell upon Gregory, who sought
to improve his grip, but lost ground in so doing, and, staggering
backwards, was driven to prop himself against the side of a vat. Here
their grapple became more desperate, more final, in the same unbroken
silence. Nanâ€™s imagination could not extend to reasons or to outcome; it
did not extend beyond the struggle of the moment. She was numbed; all
energy was absorbed by that group of wrestling Titans.

She bent down to Linnet, whose eyes had opened dazedly upon her. When
she looked up again she saw a change. Silas had stooped until his arms
clasped his brother below the waist. For one terrible moment she saw
Gregory lifted off his feet, his arms flung impotently up, his body bent
back in its supreme effort, his throat extended, to give vent to the
most hideous sound she had ever heard uttered. Silas bore him up for a
moment in that gesture of appalling ravishment, rearing like a centaur
in the full magnificence of his strength; and with one mighty heave cast
the burden from him into the boiling yellow slime of the vat.




                                  XVI


                                   I

Nan rose upright, crying aloud; the wind of terror had blown violently
in upon the stillness of the gallery. Silas towered amongst the vats; he
wore an air of unearthly triumph and exaltation. Nan! Nan! he said,
stretching up both arms with the gesture of the fanatic over the
blood-offering. What have you done? what have you done? she cried.
Saved you,â€”bought you free, he answered loudly, still lit up by his
triumph, but she hid her face in her hands, and moaned, shuddering.

Morgan stirred, and lay gazing without comprehension. He whispered Nanâ€™s
name; she started, and turned to him, but seeing his eyes opened she
wildly laid her hand across them. You mustnâ€™t look,â€”you mustnâ€™t look,
she said, distraught, in the effort to preserve him although she
understood nothing herself.

In that absence of understanding she saw only Silas erect there with his
arms still stretched out, as a sinner might stare into heaven, or a
martyr into hell, accepting either, because enlightened as to both.

Silas! she called, unbearably alarmed.

Builders and destroyers, he replied from afar, and in the tone of one
giving utterance to a quotation of secret familiarity.

What am I to do? she cried, in a lost whisper. She felt immeasurably
removed from the succour of mankind, forced into the kindred of the
Denes, amongst grotesque surroundings, and grotesque and terrible
events, high above the comings and goings of the temperate world. There
was no room in her mind for the thought that the body of Gregory was
pitched sinking through the morass of that deadly cauldron. Then the
word Gregory! came to her, and, wonderingly, she pronounced it aloud,
Gregory, thereby bringing realisation upon herself, and the first
conscious dismay.

She went to Silas and seized him by the arm.

Silas, speak to me....

He turned his eyes full upon her face.

O God, can you _see_ me? she murmured, shrinking away.

There was nothing else to be done, he said.

Oh, yes, yes! she protested, inarticulate in her extreme distress and
bewilderment.

There was nothing else, he repeated.


                                   II

She perceived then that, according to the temper of his mind, there was
indeed nothing else. She ceased to protest, overtaken by the actual
consequence of his uncompromising creed.

You have killed Gregory, she said.

A change came over him; his look of flaming justification died down.

Hannah. Martin. Christine. Gregory, he said sorrowfully.

Nan was crying; she was frightened by the monstrous, fantastic
extravagance of the scene. Silas must have decoyed her to the heart of
some distorted maze, where death was not solemn, nor grief venerable;
and therein she was lost. Crying, her arm crooked across her eyes, she
made her way over to Linnet, who had risen to his feet. Itâ€™s
soap,â€”_soap_, she stammered, taking refuge against him.

He held her, since no words could help, and she made herself as small as
possible within his arm. Silas called out to him across the gallery, I
have thrown Gregory into the vat, pointing to the wrong vat, and
forcing himself to laugh very loudly.

But what is to become of _you_? madman! Linnet exclaimed.

This was a new idea to Silas.

Yes, I must think of getting away, itâ€™s true, he replied, suddenly
busy; and he moved excitably in what he thought to be the direction of
the door. But he had lost his bearings, and struck himself against the
corner of a vat. Whatâ€™s that? he called out. Iâ€™ll have no nonsense,
he added, speaking in a tone of incipient panic which he tried to cover
up by menace. There is no time to be lost; I canâ€™t be kept hanging
about here, or I shall be taken. I must get away, and hide somewhere. I
must hide in a barn. You will have to bring me food. The first thing to
be done is to get away. All the while he was speaking he moved about,
groping amongst the vats, trying to find his way out, but amongst that
number, where nothing helped him to distinguish one from the other, with
each step he became more confusedly lost. Iâ€™m blind! he cried, at last
standing stock-still, and from the anguish in his voice it might have
been believed that he had never made the discovery before.

Then he started to stride about, up and down, in and out of the gangways
left between the vats, taking any opening that offered itself. Linnet
tried to speak to him; he was interrupted, reasonable words fluttered
vainly amongst the vibrant emotions with which Silasâ€™s soul was strung.
Neither Linnet nor Nan could have any cognisance of such a diapason.
You shall not come near me, Silas shouted; how am I to know you
wouldnâ€™t give me up? although I killed Gregory for you; and I loved
Gregory.â€”Weâ€™ve destroyed one another. Itâ€™s right,â€”people like us ought
to go. Thereâ€™s no place for us. I canâ€™t save myself, he said, Iâ€™m
blind; every one can take advantage of me. How could I live hidden for
weeks in the country? But Iâ€™ll give them trouble first....

He was full of a crazy, hopeless defiance; he turned upon them the wild
flash of his sightless eyes. It _must_ end in defeat, he said, what
match is a blind man for clear-seeing men? You had me at a disadvantage,
all my life,â€”all of you! You were orderly, while I struggled. Gone
under! but not as tamely as you think. As he spoke he found the door
that gave access to the outside stairs, and dragged it open, blundering
out into the air on the iron landing. They saw him there, against the
sky, silhouetted for a moment, before he disappeared on his reckless
descent of the hazardous stair.


                                  III

Evening was rapidly falling, but the coming of night would befriend him,
since it could not hinder. As he reached the foot of the stair he stood
for a moment in hesitation. He listened. The tessellated square was
silent, but for a drip of water off a gutter into one of the great
butts; no footsteps rang across the cobbles; no voice exclaimed Why,
Dene!; no call from Nan or Linnet echoed down to him from above. He
felt himself more utterly alone than ever in his life before, more
finally at bay. Never for an instant did the idea of giving himself up
cross his mind. He was calmer now than he had been up in the gallery,
where he had bruised himself so cruelly against these serried vats.
Here, at least, he had space around him; and out there, where he meant
to go, would be still wider space, the flat freedom of the Fens, the sky
above his head, and night, the only ally that could begin to equalise
his chances with other men.

But there would be uncertainty. Always the uncertainty whether he had or
had not been seen. He might be ringed about by pursuers closing in upon
him, and not know it. He must make up his mind to that; he must make up
his mind to the knowledge that defeat would overtake him in the end.
This knowledge came to him with a strangely familiar quietness; it was
as though it had been with him all his life, although he might not have
given it a name.

In the silence of the evening he passed beyond the factory and gained
the road on the top of the great dyke stretching across the Fens. Upon
its eminence he paused, forlorn, uncertain, and derelict. That
illumination which had sustained him before, seemed now to have deserted
him; he no longer trod with the same assurance, but cautiously, afraid
of making a false step and of slipping down the sides of the dyke,
afraid of being seen, upright upon the skyline, yet not venturing to
leave the road and to make his way across the flooded country. Yet as he
stumbled on, he realised that therein lay his wisest course: the floods
would reveal no footmarks, and he would be less conspicuous than erect
on the height of the dyke. In so far as his hopelessness could devise a
plan, that was the plan to follow. He struck across the road, and,
crouching on his heels, allowed himself to slither down the escarpment.
At the bottom he found the water, icy about his ankles, and shivered at
its sinister touch. Nevertheless, he plunged forward into it, his hands
outstretched before him, determined to put all possible distance between
himself and Abbotâ€™s Etchery. Behind him the three chimneys of the
factory vomited their black plumes of noiseless smoke that trailed
across the sky, but of this he did not reckon; he was aware only of the
cry of the curlew circling above him, and of the marshy ground that
sucked back his steps beneath the water. He fought his way, each foot
held down and his progress hampered as in a nightmare, and with an
effort he dragged one foot after the other stickily out, ploughing
onwards into the unknown breadth of the marshes, ignorant of his
surroundings, of whether night had fallen, concealing him, or whether
the last bars of day still made of him a distinguishable mark. And, for
his greater misery and discomfort, as he advanced across the submerged
fields, he came periodically to the ditches that were their boundaries,
and knew them because his footing suddenly failed him and threw him
forward into the water, pitching down upon hands and knees, so that
presently he was drenched, and the touch of the water which at first had
been only about his ankles now conquered his body also, little by
little, penetrating to his skin, glacial as the presaged touch of death.
Still he advanced, striving towards no known prospective refuge, but
merely, irrationally, to increase the distance, without considering the
paltriness of the help those few poor miles could afford him.

By now, although he could not be certain of it, night had fully come. A
huge, low moon stole up above the horizon, and sailed slowly higher into
the heavens over the flooded country. In its light the few bare trees
stood up like twigs, black and stark; and still across the now shining
expanse of water the blind man held on his laborious, hindered way the
splash of his steps breaking the placid surface into a ripple of jet and
silver. He had no notion how far he might have gone; he was uncertain
even whether he had succeeded in keeping straight in the same direction.
Every now and then he came to a hillock of higher ground, which lifted
him for the moment out of the floods, and every now and then he stumbled
into a ditch, from which he extricated himself, his teeth chattering;
and all the time he walked with his hands groping before him, but they
could not save him from the ditches that seemed to lie in wait for him
and to take pleasure in trapping him unawares. He thought that he must
have been walking half the night. Even the curlews had ceased to cry
long since, and no owl hooted across the waste of waters. His extreme
weariness deadened him; but fever reanimated him; and it was a conflict
as to which would gain the advantage. At one moment he thought that he
must sink down from exhaustion, even into the floods; the next moment, a
bout of fear and determination spurred him on, and he splashed forward,
behind his groping hands, while obscure mutterings came in the immense
silence of the night from his moving lips.

Morning found him crouching beside some meagre trees upon one of the
hillocks out of reach of the water. His hair was matted, his eyes
bloodshot, his clothes wet and dankly clinging to his limbs. He crouched
as closely as possible to the ground, feeling about for the shelter of
the trees, which, leafless as they were, offered no shelter at all. He
crept about amongst them,â€”they might be half a dozen in number, a small
clump;â€”he crept over the twenty square feet or so of the little island
on which he was marooned, and once or twice he seemed tempted to renew
his passage through the water, for he cautiously adventured down to its
edge, and stretched out his foot towards it, but, although he essayed
this on different sides of the mound, he always took his foot back
shuddering as soon as he encountered the water, and withdrew himself in
the same shambling, furtive fashion to the shelter of the trees.

It was here that in the afternoon he was found by the men who were out
for his capture. They came beating across the flooded fields in extended
order, as men beating for game. When they first descried him from a
little way off, he still was stealing about his patch of refuge,
rambling uneasily and without purpose, now coming down to the waterâ€™s
edge, now out of sight over the curve of the hillock, now reappearing to
slink between the trees. Uncouth, haggard, his clothes torn and soiled,
his hands always at their unhappy groping, his useless eyes turning
hither and thither, he resembled some half-crazy castaway that might
have subsisted there for days on berries and foul water, too bemused now
for further endeavour; too broken in spirit for any frenzy of despair;
merely acquiescent in his climax of the long premonitory years; waiting
for the end which, after all the riot and the burden, could not be
otherwise than welcome.


                                   IV

After that day clean April poured sunlight over the marshes. Flocks of
plover settled on the emerging pasture; and the sea, whose presence was
divined rather than seen over the edge of the fens, ceased to be a
threat, and became a promise, for the peculiar void of the sky above it,
where land stopped short, grew luminous with the transparency of
shower-washed spaces. The very roads, the very railway line with its

Like a great bowl opened to the gold-moted emptiness of heaven the

                                   BY

                            MICHAEL SADLEIR

        The story of the decline and fall of Whern is always
        poignant and never dismal. The romance is of the stuff
        of the story, seen by an author who knows the world we
        live in.... The picture, for all of its rich colour and
        noble gesture, is essentially true. And it is full of
        that queer fascination exerted by greatness that is
        passing or has passed.â€”_Times Literary Supplement._

               =Hamilton Fyfe in the _DAILY MAIL_ says:=

        About â€˜Privilegeâ€™ I find it hard to write without
        exaggeration. It is so truly imagined, this story of the
        decline of an ancient family; so skilfully presented,
        and written with so sure a hand, that we must put its
        author among the most distinguished not only of our
        younger but of all our novelists.... The entire book is
        a piece of literature, satisfying from every point of
        view.

                            =_PUNCH_ says:=

        I can imagine few books that would give to some modern
        Rip van Winkle a better understanding of the attitude of
        aristocratic youth towards the life of to-day.... A
        novel both individual and touched with a dignity too
        rare in these days of slovenly fiction.




                     The House in Queen Anne Square


                                   By

                              W. D. Lyell

        An admirably written novel of intrigue.... The author
        depicts all the various situations by which a plot most
        dexterously contrived is unravelled.... This is
        melodrama, to be sure, but it is very distinctly of the
        police variety. Both in characterization and in style it
        is far superior to the ordinary mystery story.

                                   _From The Providence Journal_

        The House in Queen Anne Square can be pronounced the
        best mystery story recently found on a constantly
        lengthening list.... It is about the cleverest mystery
        that anybody could conceive.... It may now be suspected
        that the absorbing story is written with unusual
        skill.... It is not your ordinary detective tale turned
        out as you wait.

                                   _From The Pittsburg Dispatch_

        An interesting and well-sustained mystery story, whose
        solution baffles the reader until the very end.

                                       _From The New York Times_

        Mystery, the confusion of identities and crime of a
        horrible subtle nature carry the reader through exciting
        chapters. There are many dramatic moments.... At the
        taleâ€™s close comes a very astonishing climax.

                                        _The Buffalo Commercial_




                     The Man with the Brooding Eyes


                                   By

                              John Goodwin
                       Author of Without Mercy

        A romance full of excitement and surprises, woven around
        the plots not only of the execrable Callaghan Gang,
        who get into their clutches a stenographer who turns out
        to be an heiress, but of the counter-plots of a devoted
        lover and clever lawyer, and of a tall, lean man with
        brooding eyes, who plays providence in a story in the
        early part of which he figures as one of the principal
        villains.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  Inscribed to a dear Child:
  in memory of golden summer hours
  and whispers of a summer sea.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,
      Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well
  Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask
          The tale one loves to tell.

  Rude scoffer of the seething outer strife,
      Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
  Deem, if thou wilt, such hours a waste of life,
          Empty of all delight!

  Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy
      Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled;
  Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy,
          The heart-love of a child!

  Away, fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!
      Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days
  Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore
          Yet haunt my dreaming gaze!

PHANTASMAGORIA.


CANTO I.

The Trystyng.

  One winter night, at half-past nine,
      Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,
  I had come home, too late to dine,
  And supper, with cigars and wine,
      Was waiting in the study.

  There was a strangeness in the room,
      And Something white and wavy
  Was standing near me in the gloom--
  _I_ took it for the carpet-broom
      Left by that careless slavey.

[Illustration]

  But presently the Thing began
      To shiver and to sneeze:
  On which I said "Come, come, my man!
  That's a most inconsiderate plan.
      Less noise there, if you please!"

  "I've caught a cold," the Thing replies,
      "Out there upon the landing."
  I turned to look in some surprise,
  And there, before my very eyes,
      A little Ghost was standing!

  He trembled when he caught my eye,
      And got behind a chair.
  "How came you here," I said, "and why?
  I never saw a thing so shy.
      Come out! Don't shiver there!"

  He said "I'd gladly tell you how,
      And also tell you why;
  But" (here he gave a little bow)
  "You're in so bad a temper now,
      You'd think it all a lie.

  "And as to being in a fright,
      Allow me to remark
  That Ghosts have just as good a right,
  In every way, to fear the light,
      As Men to fear the dark."

  "No plea," said I, "can well excuse
      Such cowardice in you:
  For Ghosts can visit when they choose,
  Whereas we Humans ca'n't refuse
      To grant the interview."

  He said "A flutter of alarm
      Is not unnatural, is it?
  I really feared you meant some harm:
  But, now I see that you are calm,
      Let me explain my visit.

  "Houses are classed, I beg to state,
      According to the number
  Of Ghosts that they accommodate:
  (The Tenant merely counts as _weight_,
      With Coals and other lumber).

  "This is a 'one-ghost' house, and you
      When you arrived last summer,
  May have remarked a Spectre who
  Was doing all that Ghosts can do
      To welcome the new-comer.

  "In Villas this is always done--
      However cheaply rented:
  For, though of course there's less of fun
  When there is only room for one,
      Ghosts have to be contented.

  "That Spectre left you on the Third--
      Since then you've not been haunted:
  For, as he never sent us word,
  'Twas quite by accident we heard
      That any one was wanted.

  "A Spectre has first choice, by right,
      In filling up a vacancy;
  Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite--
  If all these fail them, they invite
      The nicest Ghoul that they can see.

  "The Spectres said the place was low,
      And that you kept bad wine:
  So, as a Phantom had to go,
  And I was first, of course, you know,
      I couldn't well decline."

  "No doubt," said I, "they settled who
      Was fittest to be sent:
  Yet still to choose a brat like you,
  To haunt a man of forty-two,
      Was no great compliment!"

  "I'm not so young, Sir," he replied,
      "As you might think. The fact is,
  In caverns by the water-side,
  And other places that I've tried,
      I've had a lot of practice:

  "But I have never taken yet
      A strict domestic part,
  And in my flurry I forget
  The Five Good Rules of Etiquette
      We have to know by heart."

  My sympathies were warming fast
      Towards the little fellow:
  He was so utterly aghast
  At having found a Man at last,
      And looked so scared and yellow.

[Illustration: "IN CAVERNS BY THE WATER-SIDE"]

  "At least," I said, "I'm glad to find
      A Ghost is not a _dumb_ thing!
  But pray sit down: you'll feel inclined
  (If, like myself, you have not dined)
      To take a snack of something:

  "Though, certainly, you don't appear
      A thing to offer _food_ to!
  And then I shall be glad to hear--
  If you will say them loud and clear--
      The Rules that you allude to."

  "Thanks! You shall hear them by and by
      This _is_ a piece of luck!"
  "What may I offer you?" said I.
  "Well, since you _are_ so kind, I'll try
      A little bit of duck.

  "_One_ slice! And may I ask you for
      Another drop of gravy?"
  I sat and looked at him in awe,
  For certainly I never saw
      A thing so white and wavy.

[Illustration]

  And still he seemed to grow more white,
      More vapoury, and wavier--
  Seen in the dim and flickering light,
  As he proceeded to recite
      His "Maxims of Behaviour."


CANTO II.

Hys Fyve Rules.

  "My First--but don't suppose," he said,
      "I'm setting you a riddle--
  Is--if your Victim be in bed,
  Don't touch the curtains at his head,
      But take them in the middle,

  "And wave them slowly in and out,
      While drawing them asunder;
  And in a minute's time, no doubt,
  He'll raise his head and look about
      With eyes of wrath and wonder.

  "And here you must on no pretence
      Make the first observation.
  Wait for the Victim to commence:
  No Ghost of any common sense
      Begins a conversation.

[Illustration]

  "If he should say '_How came you here?_'
      (The way that _you_ began, Sir,)
  In such a case your course is clear--
  '_On the bat's back, my little dear!_'
      Is the appropriate answer.

  "If after this he says no more,
      You'd best perhaps curtail your
  Exertions--go and shake the door,
  And then, if he begins to snore,
      You'll know the thing's a failure.

  "By day, if he should be alone--
      At home or on a walk--
  You merely give a hollow groan,
  To indicate the kind of tone
      In which you mean to talk.

  "But if you find him with his friends,
      The thing is rather harder.
  In such a case success depends
  On picking up some candle-ends,
      Or butter, in the larder.

  "With this you make a kind of slide
      (It answers best with suet),
  On which you must contrive to glide,
  And swing yourself from side to side--
      One soon learns how to do it.

  "The Second tells us what is right
      In ceremonious calls:--
  '_First burn a blue or crimson light_'
  (A thing I quite forgot to-night),
      '_Then scratch the door or walls._'"

[Illustration: "AND SWING YOURSELF FROM SIDE TO SIDE"]

  I said "You'll visit _here_ no more,
      If you attempt the Guy.
  I'll have no bonfires on _my_ floor--
  And, as for scratching at the door,
      I'd like to see you try!"

  "The Third was written to protect
      The interests of the Victim,
  And tells us, as I recollect,
  _To treat him with a grave respect,
      And not to contradict him_."

  "That's plain," said I, "as Tare and Tret,
      To any comprehension:
  I only wish _some_ Ghosts I've met
  Would not so _constantly_ forget
      The maxim that you mention!"

  "Perhaps," he said, "_you_ first transgressed
      The laws of hospitality:
  All Ghosts instinctively detest
  The Man that fails to treat his guest
      With proper cordiality.

[Illustration]

  "If you address a Ghost as 'Thing!'
      Or strike him with a hatchet,
  He is permitted by the King
  To drop all _formal_ parleying--
      And then you're _sure_ to catch it!

  "The Fourth prohibits trespassing
      Where other Ghosts are quartered:
  And those convicted of the thing
  (Unless when pardoned by the King)
      Must instantly be slaughtered.

  "That simply means 'be cut up small':
      Ghosts soon unite anew:
  The process scarcely hurts at all--
  Not more than when _you're_ what you call
      'Cut up' by a Review.

  "The Fifth is one you may prefer
      That I should quote entire:--
  _The King must be addressed as 'Sir.'
  This, from a simple courtier,
      Is all the Laws require_:

  "_But, should you wish to do the thing
      With out-and-out politeness,
  Accost him as 'My Goblin King!'
  And always use, in answering,
      The phrase 'Your Royal Whiteness!'_

  "I'm getting rather hoarse, I fear,
      After so much reciting:
  So, if you don't object, my dear,
  We'll try a glass of bitter beer--
      I think it looks inviting."

CANTO III.

Scarmoges.

  "And did you really walk," said I,
      "On such a wretched night?
  I always fancied Ghosts could fly--
  If not exactly in the sky,
      Yet at a fairish height."

  "It's very well," said he, "for Kings
      To soar above the earth:
  But Phantoms often find that wings--
  Like many other pleasant things--
      Cost more than they are worth.

  "Spectres of course are rich, and so
      Can buy them from the Elves:
  But _we_ prefer to keep below--
  They're stupid company, you know.
      For any but themselves:

[Illustration]

  "For, though they claim to be exempt
      From pride, they treat a Phantom
  As something quite beneath contempt--
  Just as no Turkey ever dreamt
      Of noticing a Bantam."

  "They seem too proud," said I, "to go
      To houses such as mine.
  Pray, how did they contrive to know
  So quickly that 'the place was low,'
      And that I 'kept bad wine'?"

  "Inspector Kobold came to you--"
      The little Ghost began.
  Here I broke in--"Inspector who?
  Inspecting Ghosts is something new!
      Explain yourself my man!"

  "His name is Kobold," said my guest:
      "One of the Spectre order:
  You'll very often see him dressed
  In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,
      And a night-cap with a border.

  "He tried the Brocken business first,
      But caught a sort of chill;
  So came to England to be nursed,
  And here it took the form of _thirst_,
      Which he complains of still.

[Illustration: "AND HERE IT TOOK THE FORM OF _THIRST_"]

  "Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound,
      Warms his old bones like nectar:
  And as the inns, where it is found,
  Are his especial hunting-ground,
      We call him the _Inn-Spectre_."

  I bore it--bore it like a man--
      This agonizing witticism!
  And nothing could be sweeter than
  My temper, till the Ghost began
      Some most provoking criticism.

  "Cooks need not be indulged in waste;
      Yet still you'd better teach them
  Dishes should have _some sort_ of taste.
  Pray, why are all the cruets placed
      Where nobody can reach them?

  "That man of yours will never earn
      His living as a waiter!
  Is that queer _thing_ supposed to burn?
  (It's far too dismal a concern
      To call a Moderator).

  "The duck was tender, but the peas
      Were very much too old:
  And just remember, if you please,
  The _next_ time you have toasted cheese,
      Don't let them send it cold.

  "You'd find the bread improved, I think,
      By getting better flour:
  And have you anything to drink
  That looks a _little_ less like ink,
      And isn't _quite_ so sour?"

  Then, peering round with curious eyes,
      He muttered "Goodness gracious!"
  And so went on to criticise--
  "Your room's an inconvenient size:
      It's neither snug nor spacious.

  "That narrow window, I expect,
      Serves but to let the dusk in--"
  "But please," said I, "to recollect
  'Twas fashioned by an architect
      Who pinned his faith on Ruskin!"

  "I don't care who he was, Sir, or
      On whom he pinned his faith!
  Constructed by whatever law,
  So poor a job I never saw,
      As I'm a living Wraith!

  "What a re-markable cigar!
      How much are they a dozen?"
  I growled "No matter what they are!
  You're getting as familiar
      As if you were my cousin!

  "Now that's a thing _I will not stand_,
      And so I tell you flat."
  "Aha," said he, "we're getting grand!"
  (Taking a bottle in his hand)
      "I'll soon arrange for _that_!"

  And here he took a careful aim,
      And gaily cried "Here goes!"
  I tried to dodge it as it came,
  But somehow caught it, all the same,
      Exactly on my nose.

  And I remember nothing more
      That I can clearly fix,
  Till I was sitting on the floor,
  Repeating "Two and five are four,
      But _five and two_ are six."

  What really passed I never learned,
      Nor guessed: I only know
  That, when at last my sense returned,
  The lamp, neglected, dimly burned--
      The fire was getting low--

  Through driving mists I seemed to see
      A Thing that smirked and smiled:
  And found that he was giving me
  A lesson in Biography,
      As if I were a child.

CANTO IV.

Hys Nouryture.

  "Oh, when I was a little Ghost,
      A merry time had we!
  Each seated on his favourite post,
  We chumped and chawed the buttered toast
      They gave us for our tea."

  "That story is in print!" I cried.
      "Don't say it's not, because
  It's known as well as Bradshaw's Guide!"
  (The Ghost uneasily replied
      He hardly thought it was).

  "It's not in Nursery Rhymes? And yet
      I almost think it is--
  'Three little Ghosteses' were set
  'On posteses,' you know, and ate
      Their 'buttered toasteses.'

  "I have the book; so, if you doubt it--"
      I turned to search the shelf.
  "Don't stir!" he cried. "We'll do without it;
  I now remember all about it;
      I wrote the thing myself.

  "It came out in a 'Monthly,' or
      At least my agent said it did:
  Some literary swell, who saw
  It, thought it seemed adapted for
      The Magazine he edited.

  "My father was a Brownie, Sir;
      My mother was a Fairy.
  The notion had occurred to her,
  The children would be happier,
      If they were taught to vary.

  "The notion soon became a craze;
      And, when it once began, she
  Brought us all out in different ways--
  One was a Pixy, two were Fays,
      Another was a Banshee;

  "The Fetch and Kelpie went to school,
      And gave a lot of trouble;
  Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul,
  And then two Trolls (which broke the rule),
      A Goblin, and a Double--

  "(If that's a snuff-box on the shelf,"
      He added with a yawn,
  "I'll take a pinch)--next came an Elf,
  And then a Phantom (that's myself),
      And last, a Leprechaun.

  "One day, some Spectres chanced to call,
      Dressed in the usual white:
  I stood and watched them in the hall,
  And couldn't make them out at all,
      They seemed so strange a sight.

[Illustration]

  "I wondered what on earth they were,
      That looked all head and sack;
  But Mother told me not to stare,
  And then she twitched me by the hair,
      And punched me in the back.

  "Since then I've often wished that I
      Had been a Spectre born.
  But what's the use?" (He heaved a sigh).
  "_They_ are the ghost-nobility,
      And look on _us_ with scorn.

  "My phantom-life was soon begun:
      When I was barely six,
  I went out with an older one--
  And just at first I thought it fun,
      And learned a lot of tricks.

  "I've haunted dungeons, castles, towers--
      Wherever I was sent:
  I've often sat and howled for hours,
  Drenched to the skin with driving showers,
      Upon a battlement.

  "It's quite old-fashioned now to groan
      When you begin to speak:
  This is the newest thing in tone--"
  And here (it chilled me to the bone)
      He gave an _awful_ squeak.

  "Perhaps," he added, "to _your_ ear
      That sounds an easy thing?
  Try it yourself, my little dear!
  It took _me_ something like a year,
      With constant practising.

  "And when you've learned to squeak, my man
      And caught the double sob,
  You're pretty much where you began:
  Just try and gibber if you can!
      That's something _like_ a job!

  "_I've_ tried it, and can only say
      I'm sure you couldn't do it, e-
  ven if you practised night and day,
  Unless you have a turn that way,
      And natural ingenuity.

  "Shakspeare I think it is who treats
      Of Ghosts, in days of old,
  Who 'gibbered in the Roman streets,'
  Dressed, if you recollect, in sheets--
      They must have found it cold.

  "I've often spent ten pounds on stuff,
      In dressing as a Double;
  But, though it answers as a puff,
  It never has effect enough
      To make it worth the trouble.

  "Long bills soon quenched the little thirst
      I had for being funny.
  The setting-up is always worst:
  Such heaps of things you want at first,
      One must be made of money!

[Illustration]

  "For instance, take a Haunted Tower,
      With skull, cross-bones, and sheet;
  Blue lights to burn (say) two an hour,
  Condensing lens of extra power,
      And set of chains complete:

  "What with the things you have to hire--
      The fitting on the robe--
  And testing all the coloured fire--
  The outfit of itself would tire
      The patience of a Job!

  "And then they're so fastidious,
      The Haunted-House Committee:
  I've often known them make a fuss
  Because a Ghost was French, or Russ,
      Or even from the City!

  "Some dialects are objected to--
      For one, the _Irish_ brogue is:
  And then, for all you have to do,
  One pound a week they offer you,
      And find yourself in Bogies!"


CANTO V.

Byckerment.

  "Don't they consult the 'Victims,' though?"
      I said. "They should, by rights,
  Give them a chance--because, you know,
  The tastes of people differ so,
      Especially in Sprites."

  The Phantom shook his head and smiled.
      "Consult them? Not a bit!
  'Twould be a job to drive one wild,
  To satisfy one single child--
      There'd be no end to it!"

  "Of course you can't leave _children_ free,"
      Said I, "to pick and choose:
  But, in the case of men like me,
  I think 'Mine Host' might fairly be
      Allowed to state his views."

  He said "It really wouldn't pay--
      Folk are so full of fancies.
  We visit for a single day,
  And whether then we go, or stay,
      Depends on circumstances.

  "And, though we don't consult 'Mine Host'
      Before the thing's arranged,
  Still, if he often quits his post,
  Or is not a well-mannered Ghost,
      Then you can have him changed.

  "But if the host's a man like you--
      I mean a man of sense;
  And if the house is not too new--"
  "Why, what has _that_," said I, "to do
      With Ghost's convenience?"

  "A new house does not suit, you know--
      It's such a job to trim it:
  But, after twenty years or so,
  The wainscotings begin to go,
      So twenty is the limit."

  "To trim" was not a phrase I could
      Remember having heard:
  "Perhaps," I said, "you'll be so good
  As tell me what is understood
      Exactly by that word?"

[Illustration]

  "It means the loosening all the doors,"
      The Ghost replied, and laughed:
  "It means the drilling holes by scores
  In all the skirting-boards and floors,
      To make a thorough draught.

  "You'll sometimes find that one or two
      Are all you really need
  To let the wind come whistling through--
  But _here_ there'll be a lot to do!"
      I faintly gasped "Indeed!

  "If I'd been rather later, I'll
      Be bound," I added, trying
  (Most unsuccessfully) to smile,
  "You'd have been busy all this while,
      Trimming and beautifying?"

  "Why, no," said he; "perhaps I should
      Have stayed another minute--
  But still no Ghost, that's any good,
  Without an introduction would
      Have ventured to begin it.

  "The proper thing, as you were late,
      Was certainly to go:
  But, with the roads in such a state,
  I got the Knight-Mayor's leave to wait
      For half an hour or so."

  "Who's the Knight-Mayor?" I cried. Instead
      Of answering my question,
  "Well! If you don't know _that_," he said,
  "Either you never go to bed,
      Or you've a grand digestion!

  "He goes about and sits on folk
      That eat too much at night:
  His duties are to pinch, and poke,
  And squeeze them till they nearly choke."
      (I said "It serves them right!")

  "And folk that sup on things like these--"
      He muttered, "eggs and bacon--
  Lobster--and duck--and toasted cheese--
  If they don't get an awful squeeze,
      I'm very much mistaken!

  "He is immensely fat, and so
      Well suits the occupation:
  In point of fact, if you must know,
  We used to call him, years ago,
      _The Mayor and Corporation_!

[Illustration: "HE GOES ABOUT AND SITS ON FOLK"]

  "The day he was elected Mayor
      I _know_ that every Sprite meant
  To vote for _me_, but did not dare--
  He was so frantic with despair
      And furious with excitement.

[Illustration]

  "When it was over, for a whim,
      He ran to tell the King;
  And being the reverse of slim,
  A two-mile trot was not for him
      A very easy thing.

  "So, to reward him for his run
      (As it was baking hot,
  And he was over twenty stone),
  The King proceeded, half in fun,
      To knight him on the spot."

  "'Twas a great liberty to take!"
      (I fired up like a rocket).
  "He did it just for punning's sake:
  'The man,' says Johnson, 'that would make
      A pun, would pick a pocket!'"

  "A man," said he, "is not a King."
      I argued for a while,
  And did my best to prove the thing--
  The Phantom merely listening
      With a contemptuous smile.

  At last, when, breath and patience spent,
      I had recourse to smoking--
  "Your _aim_," he said, "is excellent:
  But--when you call it _argument_--
      Of course you're only joking?"

[Illustration]

  Stung by his cold and snaky eye,
      I roused myself at length
  To say "At least I do defy
  The veriest sceptic to deny
      That union is strength!"

  "That's true enough," said he, "yet stay--"
      I listened in all meekness--
  "_Union_ is strength, I'm bound to say;
  In fact, the thing's as clear as day;
      But _onions_--are a weakness."


CANTO VI.

Dyscomfyture.

  As one who strives a hill to climb,
      Who never climbed before:
  Who finds it, in a little time,
  Grow every moment less sublime,
      And votes the thing a bore:

  Yet, having once begun to try,
      Dares not desert his quest,
  But, climbing, ever keeps his eye
  On one small hut against the sky,
      Wherein he hopes to rest:

  Who climbs till nerve and force are spent,
      With many a puff and pant:
  Who still, as rises the ascent,
  In language grows more violent,
      Although in breath more scant:

[Illustration]

  Who, climbing, gains at length the place
      That crowns the upward track;
  And, entering with unsteady pace,
  Receives a buffet in the face
      That lands him on his back:

  And feels himself, like one in sleep,
      Glide swiftly down again,
  A helpless weight, from steep to steep,
  Till, with a headlong giddy sweep,
      He drops upon the plain--

  So I, that had resolved to bring
      Conviction to a ghost,
  And found it quite a different thing
  From any human arguing,
      Yet dared not quit my post

  But, keeping still the end in view
      To which I hoped to come,
  I strove to prove the matter true
  By putting everything I knew
      Into an axiom:

  Commencing every single phrase
      With 'therefore' or 'because,'
  I blindly reeled, a hundred ways,
  About the syllogistic maze,
      Unconscious where I was.

  Quoth he "That's regular clap-trap:
      Don't bluster any more.
  Now _do_ be cool and take a nap!
  Such a ridiculous old chap
      Was never seen before!

  "You're like a man I used to meet,
      Who got one day so furious
  In arguing, the simple heat
  Scorched both his slippers off his feet!"
      I said "_That's very curious!_"

[Illustration: "SCORCHED BOTH HIS SLIPPERS OFF HIS FEET"]

  "Well, it _is_ curious, I agree,
      And sounds perhaps like fibs:
  But still it's true as true can be--
  As sure as your name's Tibbs," said he.
      I said "My name's _not_ Tibbs."

  "_Not_ Tibbs!" he cried--his tone became
      A shade or two less hearty--
  "Why, no," said I. "My proper name
  Is Tibbets--" "Tibbets?" "Aye, the same."
      "Why, then YOU'RE NOT THE PARTY!"

  With that he struck the board a blow
      That shivered half the glasses.
  "Why couldn't you have told me so
  Three quarters of an hour ago,
      You prince of all the asses?

  "To walk four miles through mud and rain,
      To spend the night in smoking,
  And then to find that it's in vain--
  And I've to do it all again--
      It's really _too_ provoking!

[Illustration]

  "Don't talk!" he cried, as I began
      To mutter some excuse.
  "Who can have patience with a man
  That's got no more discretion than
      An idiotic goose?

  "To keep me waiting here, instead
      Of telling me at once
  That this was not the house!" he said.
  "There, that'll do--be off to bed!
      Don't gape like that, you dunce!"

  "It's very fine to throw the blame
      On _me_ in such a fashion!
  Why didn't you enquire my name
  The very minute that you came?"
      I answered in a passion.

  "Of course it worries you a bit
      To come so far on foot--
  But how was _I_ to blame for it?"
  "Well, well!" said he. "I must admit
      That isn't badly put.

  "And certainly you've given me
      The best of wine and victual--
  Excuse my violence," said he,
  "But accidents like this, you see,
      They put one out a little.

  "'Twas _my_ fault after all, I find--
      Shake hands, old Turnip-top!"
  The name was hardly to my mind,
  But, as no doubt he meant it kind,
      I let the matter drop.

  "Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!
      When I am gone, perhaps
  They'll send you some inferior Sprite,
  Who'll keep you in a constant fright
      And spoil your soundest naps.

  "Tell him you'll stand no sort of trick;
      Then, if he leers and chuckles,
  You just be handy with a stick
  (Mind that it's pretty hard and thick)
      And rap him on the knuckles!

  "Then carelessly remark 'Old coon!
      Perhaps you're not aware
  That, if you don't behave, you'll soon
  Be chuckling to another tune--
      And so you'd best take care!'

  "That's the right way to cure a Sprite
      Of such-like goings-on--
  But gracious me! It's getting light!
  Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!"
      A nod, and he was gone.

CANTO VII.

Sad Souvenaunce.

[Illustration]

  "What's this?" I pondered. "Have I slept?
      Or can I have been drinking?"
  But soon a gentler feeling crept
  Upon me, and I sat and wept
      An hour or so, like winking.

  "No need for Bones to hurry so!"
      I sobbed. "In fact, I doubt
  If it was worth his while to go--
  And who is Tibbs, I'd like to know,
      To make such work about?

  "If Tibbs is anything like me,
      It's _possible_," I said,
  "He won't be over-pleased to be
  Dropped in upon at half-past three,
      After he's snug in bed.

  "And if Bones plagues him anyhow--
      Squeaking and all the rest of it,
  As he was doing here just now--
  _I_ prophesy there'll be a row,
      And Tibbs will have the best of it!"

  Then, as my tears could never bring
      The friendly Phantom back,
  It seemed to me the proper thing
  To mix another glass, and sing
      The following Coronach.

[Illustration: "AND TIBBS WILL HAVE THE BEST OF IT"]

  '_And art thou gone, beloved Ghost?
      Best of Familiars!
  Nay then, farewell, my duckling roast,
  Farewell, farewell, my tea and toast,
      My meerschaum and cigars!_

  '_The hues of life are dull and gray,
      The sweets of life insipid,
  When thou, my charmer, art away--
  Old Brick, or rather, let me say,
      Old Parallelepiped!_'

  Instead of singing Verse the Third,
      I ceased--abruptly, rather:
  But, after such a splendid word,
  I felt that it would be absurd
      To try it any farther.

  So with a yawn I went my way
      To seek the welcome downy,
  And slept, and dreamed till break of day
  Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay
      And Leprechaun and Brownie!

  For years I've not been visited
      By any kind of Sprite;
  Yet still they echo in my head,
  Those parting words, so kindly said,
      "Old Turnip-top, good-night!"

ECHOES.


          Lady Clara Vere de Vere
          Was eight years old, she said:
  Every ringlet, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden thread.

          She took her little porringer:
          Of me she shall not win renown:
  For the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down.

          "Sisters and brothers, little Maid?
          There stands the Inspector at thy door:
  Like a dog, he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four."

          "Kind words are more than coronets,"
          She said, and wondering looked at me:
  "It is the dead unhappy night, and I must hurry home to tea."




A SEA DIRGE.

[Illustration]


  There are certain things--as, a spider, a ghost,
    The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three--
  That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most
        Is a thing they call the Sea.

  Pour some salt water over the floor--
    Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be:
  Suppose it extended a mile or more,
        _That's_ very like the Sea.

  Beat a dog till it howls outright--
    Cruel, but all very well for a spree:
  Suppose that he did so day and night,
        _That_ would be like the Sea.

  I had a vision of nursery-maids;
    Tens of thousands passed by me--
  All leading children with wooden spades,
        And this was by the Sea.

  Who invented those spades of wood?
    Who was it cut them out of the tree?
  None, I think, but an idiot could--
        Or one that loved the Sea.

  It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
    With 'thoughts as boundless, and souls as free':
  But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,
        How do you like the Sea?

[Illustration: "AND THIS WAS BY THE SEA"]

  There is an insect that people avoid
    (Whence is derived the verb 'to flee').
  Where have you been by it most annoyed?
        In lodgings by the Sea.

  If you like your coffee with sand for dregs,
    A decided hint of salt in your tea,
  And a fishy taste in the very eggs--
        By all means choose the Sea.

  And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,
    You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,
  And a chronic state of wet in your feet,
      Then--I recommend the Sea.

  For _I_ have friends who dwell by the coast--
    Pleasant friends they are to me!
  It is when I am with them I wonder most
        That any one likes the Sea.

  They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,
    To climb the heights I madly agree;
  And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,
        They kindly suggest the Sea.

  I try the rocks, and I think it cool
    That they laugh with such an excess of glee,
  As I heavily slip into every pool
        That skirts the cold cold Sea.

HIAWATHA'S PHOTOGRAPHING.

[In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight
attempt at doing what is known to be so easy. Any fairly practised writer,
with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in
the easy running metre of 'The Song of Hiawatha.' Having, then, distinctly
stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its
merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his
criticism to its treatment of the subject.]


  From his shoulder Hiawatha
  Took the camera of rosewood,
  Made of sliding, folding rosewood;
  Neatly put it all together.
  In its case it lay compactly,
  Folded into nearly nothing;
  But he opened out the hinges,
  Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,
  Till it looked all squares and oblongs,
  Like a complicated figure
  In the Second Book of Euclid.

[Illustration]

    This he perched upon a tripod--
  Crouched beneath its dusky cover--
  Stretched his hand, enforcing silence--
  Said "Be motionless, I beg you!"
  Mystic, awful was the process.
    All the family in order
  Sat before him for their pictures:
  Each in turn, as he was taken,
  Volunteered his own suggestions,
  His ingenious suggestions.
    First the Governor, the Father:
  He suggested velvet curtains
  Looped about a massy pillar;
  And the corner of a table,
  Of a rosewood dining-table.
  He would hold a scroll of something,
  Hold it firmly in his left-hand;
  He would keep his right-hand buried
  (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;
  He would contemplate the distance
  With a look of pensive meaning,
  As of ducks that die in tempests.
    Grand, heroic was the notion:
  Yet the picture failed entirely:
  Failed, because he moved a little,
  Moved, because he couldn't help it.
    Next, his better half took courage;
  She would have her picture taken.
  _She_ came dressed beyond description,
  Dressed in jewels and in satin
  Far too gorgeous for an empress.

[Illustration: "FIRST THE GOVERNOR, THE FATHER"]

  Gracefully she sat down sideways,
  With a simper scarcely human,
  Holding in her hand a bouquet
  Rather larger than a cabbage.
  All the while that she was sitting,
  Still the lady chattered, chattered,
  Like a monkey in the forest.
  "Am I sitting still?" she asked him.
  "Is my face enough in profile?
  Shall I hold the bouquet higher?
  Will it come into the picture?"
  And the picture failed completely.
    Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:
  He suggested curves of beauty,
  Curves pervading all his figure,
  Which the eye might follow onward,
  Till they centered in the breast-pin,
  Centered in the golden breast-pin.
  He had learnt it all from Ruskin
  (Author of 'The Stones of Venice,'
  'Seven Lamps of Architecture,'
  'Modern Painters,' and some others);
  And perhaps he had not fully
  Understood his author's meaning;
  But, whatever was the reason,
  All was fruitless, as the picture
  Ended in an utter failure.

[Illustration: "NEXT THE SON, THE STUNNING-CANTAB"]

    Next to him the eldest daughter:
  She suggested very little,
  Only asked if he would take her
  With her look of 'passive beauty.'
    Her idea of passive beauty
  Was a squinting of the left-eye,
  Was a drooping of the right-eye,
  Was a smile that went up sideways
  To the corner of the nostrils.
    Hiawatha, when she asked him,
  Took no notice of the question,
  Looked as if he hadn't heard it;
  But, when pointedly appealed to,
  Smiled in his peculiar manner,
  Coughed and said it 'didn't matter,'
  Bit his lip and changed the subject.
    Nor in this was he mistaken,
  As the picture failed completely.
    So in turn the other sisters.

[Illustration: "NEXT TO HIM THE ELDEST DAUGHTER"]

    Last, the youngest son was taken:
  Very rough and thick his hair was,
  Very round and red his face was,
  Very dusty was his jacket,
  Very fidgety his manner.
  And his overbearing sisters
  Called him names he disapproved of:
  Called him Johnny, 'Daddy's Darling,'
  Called him Jacky, 'Scrubby School-boy.'
  And, so awful was the picture,
  In comparison the others
  Seemed, to one's bewildered fancy,
  To have partially succeeded.
    Finally my Hiawatha
  Tumbled all the tribe together,
  ('Grouped' is not the right expression),
  And, as happy chance would have it,
  Did at last obtain a picture
  Where the faces all succeeded:
  Each came out a perfect likeness.

[Illustration: "LAST, THE YOUNGEST SON WAS TAKEN"]

    Then they joined and all abused it,
  Unrestrainedly abused it,
  As the worst and ugliest picture
  They could possibly have dreamed of.
  Giving one such strange expressions--
  Sullen, stupid, pert expressions.
  Really any one would take us
  (Any one that did not know us)
  For the most unpleasant people!'
  (Hiawatha seemed to think so,
  Seemed to think it not unlikely).
  All together rang their voices,
  Angry, loud, discordant voices,
  As of dogs that howl in concert,
  As of cats that wail in chorus.
    But my Hiawatha's patience,
  His politeness and his patience,
  Unaccountably had vanished,
  And he left that happy party.
  Neither did he leave them slowly,
  With the calm deliberation,
  The intense deliberation
  Of a photographic artist:
  But he left them in a hurry,
  Left them in a mighty hurry,
  Stating that he would not stand it,
  Stating in emphatic language
  What he'd be before he'd stand it.
  Hurriedly he packed his boxes:
  Hurriedly the porter trundled
  On a barrow all his boxes:
  Hurriedly he took his ticket:
  Hurriedly the train received him:
  Thus departed Hiawatha.

MELANCHOLETTA.


  With saddest music all day long
    She soothed her secret sorrow:
  At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong
    Such cheerful words to borrow.
  Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song
    I'll sing to thee to-morrow."

  I thanked her, but I could not say
    That I was glad to hear it:
  I left the house at break of day,
    And did not venture near it
  Till time, I hoped, had worn away
    Her grief, for nought could cheer it!

[Illustration: "AT NIGHT SHE SIGHED"]

  My dismal sister! Couldst thou know
    The wretched home thou keepest!
  Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
    Is thankful when thou sleepest;
  For if I laugh, however low,
    When thou'rt awake, thou weepest!

  I took my sister t'other day
    (Excuse the slang expression)
  To Sadler's Wells to see the play,
    In hopes the new impression
  Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay
    Effect some slight digression.

  I asked three gay young dogs from town
    To join us in our folly,
  Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown
    My sister's melancholy:
  The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,
    And Robinson the jolly.

  The maid announced the meal in tones
    That I myself had taught her,
  Meant to allay my sister's moans
    Like oil on troubled water:
  I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,
    And begged him to escort her.

  Vainly he strove, with ready wit,
    To joke about the weather--
  To ventilate the last '_on dit_'--
    To quote the price of leather--
  She groaned "Here I and Sorrow sit:
    Let us lament together!"

  I urged "You're wasting time, you know:
    Delay will spoil the venison."
  "My heart is wasted with my woe!
    There is no rest--in Venice, on
  The Bridge of Sighs!" she quoted low
    From Byron and from Tennyson.

  I need not tell of soup and fish
    In solemn silence swallowed,
  The sobs that ushered in each dish,
    And its departure followed,
  Nor yet my suicidal wish
    To _be_ the cheese I hollowed.

  Some desperate attempts were made
    To start a conversation;
  "Madam," the sportive Brown essayed,
    "Which kind of recreation,
  Hunting or fishing, have you made
    Your special occupation?"

  Her lips curved downwards instantly,
    As if of india-rubber.
  "Hounds _in full cry_ I like," said she:
    (Oh how I longed to snub her!)
  "Of fish, a whale's the one for me,
    _It is so full of blubber_!"

  The night's performance was "King John."
    "It's dull," she wept, "and so-so!"
  A while I let her tears flow on,
    She said they soothed her woe so!
  At length the curtain rose upon
    'Bombastes Furioso.'

  In vain we roared; in vain we tried
    To rouse her into laughter:
  Her pensive glances wandered wide
    From orchestra to rafter--
  "_Tier upon tier!_" she said, and sighed;
    And silence followed after.

A VALENTINE.

[Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him
when he came, but didn't seem to miss him if he stayed away.]


  And cannot pleasures, while they last,
  Be actual unless, when past,
  They leave us shuddering and aghast,
          With anguish smarting?
  And cannot friends be firm and fast,
          And yet bear parting?

  And must I then, at Friendship's call,
  Calmly resign the little all
  (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
          I have of gladness,
  And lend my being to the thrall
          Of gloom and sadness?

  And think you that I should be dumb,
  And full _dolorum omnium_,
  Excepting when _you_ choose to come
          And share my dinner?
  At other times be sour and glum
          And daily thinner?

  Must he then only live to weep,
  Who'd prove his friendship true and deep?
  By day a lonely shadow creep,
          At night-time languish,
  Oft raising in his broken sleep
          The moan of anguish?

  The lover, if for certain days
  His fair one be denied his gaze,
  Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
          But, wiser wooer,
  He spends the time in writing lays,
          And posts them to her.

  And if the verse flow free and fast,
  Till even the poet is aghast,
  A touching Valentine at last
          The post shall carry,
  When thirteen days are gone and past
          Of February.

  Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
  In desert waste or crowded street,
          Perhaps before this week shall fleet,
  Perhaps to-morrow,
  I trust to find _your_ heart the seat
          Of wasting sorrow.




THE THREE VOICES.


The First Voice.

[Illustration]

  He trilled a carol fresh and free:
  He laughed aloud for very glee:
  There came a breeze from off the sea:

  It passed athwart the glooming flat--
  It fanned his forehead as he sat--
  It lightly bore away his hat,

  All to the feet of one who stood
  Like maid enchanted in a wood,
  Frowning as darkly as she could.

  With huge umbrella, lank and brown,
  Unerringly she pinned it down,
  Right through the centre of the crown.

  Then, with an aspect cold and grim,
  Regardless of its battered rim,
  She took it up and gave it him.

  A while like one in dreams he stood,
  Then faltered forth his gratitude
  In words just short of being rude:

  For it had lost its shape and shine,
  And it had cost him four-and-nine,
  And he was going out to dine.

[Illustration: "UNERRINGLY SHE PINNED IT DOWN."]

  "To dine!" she sneered in acid tone.
  "To bend thy being to a bone
  Clothed in a radiance not its own!"

  The tear-drop trickled to his chin:
  There was a meaning in her grin
  That made him feel on fire within.

  "Term it not 'radiance,'" said he:
  "'Tis solid nutriment to me.
  Dinner is Dinner: Tea is Tea."

  And she "Yea so? Yet wherefore cease?
  Let thy scant knowledge find increase.
  Say 'Men are Men, and Geese are Geese.'"

  He moaned: he knew not what to say.
  The thought "That I could get away!"
  Strove with the thought "But I must stay."

  "To dine!" she shrieked in dragon-wrath.
  "To swallow wines all foam and froth!
  To simper at a table-cloth!

  "Say, can thy noble spirit stoop
  To join the gormandising troop
  Who find a solace in the soup?

  "Canst thou desire or pie or puff?
  Thy well-bred manners were enough,
  Without such gross material stuff."

  "Yet well-bred men," he faintly said,
  "Are not unwilling to be fed:
  Nor are they well without the bread."

  Her visage scorched him ere she spoke:
  "There are," she said, "a kind of folk
  Who have no horror of a joke.

  "Such wretches live: they take their share
  Of common earth and common air:
  We come across them here and there:

  "We grant them--there is no escape--
  A sort of semi-human shape
  Suggestive of the man-like Ape."

  "In all such theories," said he,
  "One fixed exception there must be.
  That is, the Present Company."

  Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:
  He, aiming blindly in the dark,
  With random shaft had pierced the mark.

  She felt that her defeat was plain,
  Yet madly strove with might and main
  To get the upper hand again.

  Fixing her eyes upon the beach,
  As though unconscious of his speech,
  She said "Each gives to more than each."

  He could not answer yea or nay:
  He faltered "Gifts may pass away."
  Yet knew not what he meant to say.

  "If that be so," she straight replied,
  "Each heart with each doth coincide.
  What boots it? For the world is wide."

[Illustration: "HE FALTERED 'GIFTS MAY PASS AWAY.'"]

  "The world is but a Thought," said he:
  "The vast unfathomable sea
  Is but a Notion--unto me."

  And darkly fell her answer dread
  Upon his unresisting head,
  Like half a hundredweight of lead.

  "The Good and Great must ever shun
  That reckless and abandoned one
  Who stoops to perpetrate a pun.

  "The man that smokes--that reads the _Times_--
  That goes to Christmas Pantomimes--
  Is capable of _any_ crimes!"

  He felt it was his turn to speak,
  And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,
  Moaned "This is harder than Bezique!"

  But when she asked him "Wherefore so?"
  He felt his very whiskers glow,
  And frankly owned "I do not know."

[Illustration: "THIS IS HARDER THAN BEZIQUE!"]

  While, like broad waves of golden grain,
  Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,
  His colour came and went again.

  Pitying his obvious distress,
  Yet with a tinge of bitterness,
  She said "The More exceeds the Less."

  "A truth of such undoubted weight,"
  He urged, "and so extreme in date,
  It were superfluous to state."

  Roused into sudden passion, she
  In tone of cold malignity:
  "To others, yea: but not to thee."

  But when she saw him quail and quake,
  And when he urged "For pity's sake!"
  Once more in gentle tone she spake.

  "Thought in the mind doth still abide:
  That is by Intellect supplied,
  And within that Idea doth hide:

  "And he, that yearns the truth to know,
  Still further inwardly may go,
  And find Idea from Notion flow:

  "And thus the chain, that sages sought,
  Is to a glorious circle wrought,
  For Notion hath its source in Thought."

  So passed they on with even pace:
  Yet gradually one might trace
  A shadow growing on his face.

The Second Voice.

[Illustration]

  They walked beside the wave-worn beach;
  Her tongue was very apt to teach,
  And now and then he did beseech

  She would abate her dulcet tone,
  Because the talk was all her own,
  And he was dull as any drone.

  She urged "No cheese is made of chalk":
  And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,
  Tuned to the footfall of a walk.

  Her voice was very full and rich,
  And, when at length she asked him "Which?"
  It mounted to its highest pitch.

  He a bewildered answer gave,
  Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,
  Lost in the echoes of the cave.

  He answered her he knew not what:
  Like shaft from bow at random shot,
  He spoke, but she regarded not.

  She waited not for his reply,
  But with a downward leaden eye
  Went on as if he were not by:

  Sound argument and grave defence,
  Strange questions raised on "Why?" and "Whence?"
  And wildly tangled evidence.

  When he, with racked and whirling brain,
  Feebly implored her to explain,
  She simply said it all again.

  Wrenched with an agony intense,
  He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,
  And careless of all consequence:

  "Mind--I believe--is Essence--Ent--
  Abstract--that is--an Accident--
  Which we--that is to say--I meant--"

  When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,
  At length his speech was somewhat hushed,
  She looked at him, and he was crushed.

  It needed not her calm reply:
  She fixed him with a stony eye,
  And he could neither fight nor fly,

  While she dissected, word by word,
  His speech, half guessed at and half heard,
  As might a cat a little bird.

[Illustration: "HE SPAKE, NEGLECTING SOUND AND SENSE."]

  Then, having wholly overthrown
  His views, and stripped them to the bone,
  Proceeded to unfold her own.

  "Shall Man be Man? And shall he miss
  Of other thoughts no thought but this,
  Harmonious dews of sober bliss?

  "What boots it? Shall his fevered eye
  Through towering nothingness descry
  The grisly phantom hurry by?

  "And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;
  See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare
  And redden in the dusky glare?

  "The meadows breathing amber light,
  The darkness toppling from the height,
  The feathery train of granite Night?

  "Shall he, grown gray among his peers,
  Through the thick curtain of his tears
  Catch glimpses of his earlier years,

[Illustration: "SHALL MAN BE MAN?"]

  "And hear the sounds he knew of yore,
  Old shufflings on the sanded floor,
  Old knuckles tapping at the door?

  "Yet still before him as he flies
  One pallid form shall ever rise,
  And, bodying forth in glassy eyes

  "The vision of a vanished good,
  Low peering through the tangled wood,
  Shall freeze the current of his blood."

  Still from each fact, with skill uncouth
  And savage rapture, like a tooth
  She wrenched some slow reluctant truth.

  Till, like a silent water-mill,
  When summer suns have dried the rill,
  She reached a full stop, and was still.

  Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,
  As when the loaded omnibus
  Has reached the railway terminus:

  When, for the tumult of the street,
  Is heard the engine's stifled beat,
  The velvet tread of porters' feet.

  With glance that ever sought the ground,
  She moved her lips without a sound,
  And every now and then she frowned.

  He gazed upon the sleeping sea,
  And joyed in its tranquillity,
  And in that silence dead, but she

  To muse a little space did seem,
  Then, like the echo of a dream,
  Harped back upon her threadbare theme.

  Still an attentive ear he lent
  But could not fathom what she meant:
  She was not deep, nor eloquent.

  He marked the ripple on the sand:
  The even swaying of her hand
  Was all that he could understand.

  He saw in dreams a drawing-room,
  Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,
  Waiting--he thought he knew for whom:

  He saw them drooping here and there,
  Each feebly huddled on a chair,
  In attitudes of blank despair:

  Oysters were not more mute than they,
  For all their brains were pumped away,
  And they had nothing more to say--

  Save one, who groaned "Three hours are gone!"
  Who shrieked "We'll wait no longer, John!
  Tell them to set the dinner on!"

  The vision passed: the ghosts were fled:
  He saw once more that woman dread:
  He heard once more the words she said.

  He left her, and he turned aside:
  He sat and watched the coming tide
  Across the shores so newly dried.

[Illustration: "HE SAT AND WATCHED THE COMING TIDE"]

  He wondered at the waters clear,
  The breeze that whispered in his ear,
  The billows heaving far and near,

  And why he had so long preferred
  To hang upon her every word:
  "In truth," he said, "it was absurd."

[Illustration]


The Third Voice.

[Illustration]

  Not long this transport held its place:
  Within a little moment's space
  Quick tears were raining down his face.

  His heart stood still, aghast with fear;
  A wordless voice, nor far nor near,
  He seemed to hear and not to hear.

  "Tears kindle not the doubtful spark.
  If so, why not? Of this remark
  The bearings are profoundly dark."

  "Her speech," he said, "hath caused this pain.
  Easier I count it to explain
  The jargon of the howling main,

  "Or, stretched beside some babbling brook,
  To con, with inexpressive look,
  An unintelligible book."

  Low spake the voice within his head,
  In words imagined more than said,
  Soundless as ghost's intended tread:

  "If thou art duller than before,
  Why quittedst thou the voice of lore?
  Why not endure, expecting more?"

  "Rather than that," he groaned aghast,
  "I'd writhe in depths of cavern vast,
  Some loathly vampire's rich repast."

[Illustration: "HE GROANED AGHAST"]

  "'Twere hard," it answered, "themes immense
  To coop within the narrow fence
  That rings _thy_ scant intelligence."

  "Not so," he urged, "nor once alone:
  But there was something in her tone
  That chilled me to the very bone.

  "Her style was anything but clear,
  And most unpleasantly severe;
  Her epithets were very queer.

  "And yet, so grand were her replies,
  I could not choose but deem her wise;
  I did not dare to criticise;

  "Nor did I leave her, till she went
  So deep in tangled argument
  That all my powers of thought were spent."

  A little whisper inly slid,
  "Yet truth is truth: you know you did."
  A little wink beneath the lid.

  And, sickened with excess of dread,
  Prone to the dust he bent his head,
  And lay like one three-quarters dead.

  The whisper left him--like a breeze
  Lost in the depths of leafy trees--
  Left him by no means at his ease.

  Once more he weltered in despair,
  With hands, through denser-matted hair,
  More tightly clenched than then they were.

  When, bathed in Dawn of living red,
  Majestic frowned the mountain head,
  "Tell me my fault," was all he said.

  When, at high Noon, the blazing sky
  Scorched in his head each haggard eye,
  Then keenest rose his weary cry.

  And when at Eve the unpitying sun
  Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,
  "Alack," he sighed, "what _have_ I done?"

[Illustration: "TORTURED, UNAIDED, AND ALONE"]

  But saddest, darkest was the sight,
  When the cold grasp of leaden Night
  Dashed him to earth, and held him tight.

  Tortured, unaided, and alone,
  Thunders were silence to his groan,
  Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:

  "What? Ever thus, in dismal round,
  Shall Pain and Mystery profound
  Pursue me like a sleepless hound,

  "With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,
  Me, still in ignorance of the cause,
  Unknowing what I broke of laws?"

  The whisper to his ear did seem
  Like echoed flow of silent stream,
  Or shadow of forgotten dream,

  The whisper trembling in the wind:
  "Her fate with thine was intertwined,"
  So spake it in his inner mind:

[Illustration: "A SCARED DULLARD, GIBBERING LOW"]

  "Each orbed on each a baleful star:
  Each proved the other's blight and bar:
  Each unto each were best, most far:

  "Yea, each to each was worse than foe:
  Thou, a scared dullard, gibbering low,
  AND SHE, AN AVALANCHE OF WOE!"




TÈMA CON VARIAZIÓNI.

[Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of
Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music? The
Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air, then a dozen
bars of his own, then a few more notes of the Air, and so on alternately:
thus saving the listener, if not from all risk of recognising the melody
at all, at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce
in a more concentrated form. The process is termed "setting" by Composers,
and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly
set down in a heap of mortar, will recognise the truthfulness of this
happy phrase.

For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of
supreme Venison--whose every fibre seems to murmur "Excelsior!"--yet
swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of
oatmeal-porridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in
Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or
more of boarding-school beer: so also----


  I never loved a dear Gazelle--
    _Nor anything that cost me much:
  High prices profit those who sell,
    But why should I be fond of such?_

  To glad me with his soft black eye
    _My son comes trotting home from school;
  He's had a fight, but can't tell why--
    He always was a little fool!_

  But, when he came to know me well,
    _He kicked me out, her testy Sire:
  And when I stained my hair, that Belle,
    Might note the change, and thus admire_

  And love me, it was sure to dye
    _A muddy green or staring blue:
  Whilst one might trace, with half an eye,
    The still triumphant carrot through_.




A GAME OF FIVES.

  Five little girls, of Five, Four, Three, Two, One:
  Rolling on the hearthrug, full of tricks and fun.

  Five rosy girls, in years from Ten to Six:
  Sitting down to lessons--no more time for tricks.

  Five growing girls, from Fifteen to Eleven:
  Music, Drawing, Languages, and food enough for seven!

  Five winsome girls, from Twenty to Sixteen:
  Each young man that calls, I say "Now tell me which you _mean_!"

[Illustration: "NOW TELL ME WHICH YOU _MEAN_!"]

  Five dashing girls, the youngest Twenty-one:
  But, if nobody proposes, what is there to be done?

  Five showy girls--but Thirty is an age
  When girls may be _engaging_, but they somehow don't _engage_.

  Five dressy girls, of Thirty-one or more:
  So gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before!

         *       *       *       *       *

  Five _passé_ girls--Their age? Well, never mind!
  We jog along together, like the rest of human kind:
  But the quondam "careless bachelor" begins to think he knows
  The answer to that ancient problem "how the money goes"!




POETA FIT, NON NASCITUR.

[Illustration]


  "How shall I be a poet?
    How shall I write in rhyme?
  You told me once 'the very wish
    Partook of the sublime.'
  Then tell me how! Don't put me off
    With your 'another time'!"

  The old man smiled to see him,
    To hear his sudden sally;
  He liked the lad to speak his mind
    Enthusiastically;
  And thought "There's no hum-drum in him,
    Nor any shilly-shally."

  "And would you be a poet
    Before you've been to school?
  Ah, well! I hardly thought you
    So absolute a fool.
  First learn to be spasmodic--
    A very simple rule.

  "For first you write a sentence,
    And then you chop it small;
  Then mix the bits, and sort them out
    Just as they chance to fall:
  The order of the phrases makes
    No difference at all.

  "Then, if you'd be impressive,
    Remember what I say,
  That abstract qualities begin
    With capitals alway:
  The True, the Good, the Beautiful--
    Those are the things that pay!

  "Next, when you are describing
    A shape, or sound, or tint;
  Don't state the matter plainly,
    But put it in a hint;
  And learn to look at all things
    With a sort of mental squint."

  "For instance, if I wished, Sir,
    Of mutton-pies to tell,
  Should I say 'dreams of fleecy flocks
    Pent in a wheaten cell'?"
  "Why, yes," the old man said: "that phrase
    Would answer very well.

  "Then fourthly, there are epithets
    That suit with any word--
  As well as Harvey's Reading Sauce
    With fish, or flesh, or bird--
  Of these, 'wild,' 'lonely,' 'weary,' 'strange,'
    Are much to be preferred."

  "And will it do, O will it do
    To take them in a lump--
  As 'the wild man went his weary way
    To a strange and lonely pump'?"
  "Nay, nay! You must not hastily
    To such conclusions jump.

  "Such epithets, like pepper,
    Give zest to what you write;
  And, if you strew them sparely,
    They whet the appetite:
  But if you lay them on too thick,
    You spoil the matter quite!

[Illustration: "THE WILD MAN WENT HIS WEARY WAY"]

  "Last, as to the arrangement:
    Your reader, you should show him,
  Must take what information he
    Can get, and look for no im-
  mature disclosure of the drift
    And purpose of your poem.

  "Therefore, to test his patience--
    How much he can endure--
  Mention no places, names, or dates,
    And evermore be sure
  Throughout the poem to be found
    Consistently obscure.

  "First fix upon the limit
    To which it shall extend:
  Then fill it up with 'Padding'
    (Beg some of any friend):
  Your great SENSATION-STANZA
    You place towards the end."

  "And what is a Sensation,
    Grandfather, tell me, pray?
  I think I never heard the word
    So used before to-day:
  Be kind enough to mention one
    '_Exempli gratiâ_.'"

  And the old man, looking sadly
    Across the garden-lawn,
  Where here and there a dew-drop
    Yet glittered in the dawn,
  Said "Go to the Adelphi,
    And see the 'Colleen Bawn.'

  "The word is due to Boucicault--
    The theory is his,
  Where Life becomes a Spasm,
    And History a Whiz:
  If that is not Sensation,
    I don't know what it is.

  "Now try your hand, ere Fancy
    Have lost its present glow--"
  "And then," his grandson added,
    "We'll publish it, you know:
  Green cloth--gold-lettered at the back--
    In duodecimo!"

  Then proudly smiled that old man
    To see the eager lad
  Rush madly for his pen and ink
    And for his blotting-pad--
  But, when he thought of _publishing_,
    His face grew stern and sad.

THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK,

An Agony in Eight Fits.


PREFACE.

If--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense were
ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it
would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p. 144)

  "Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:"

In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a
deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of this
poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in
it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will take the more
prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.

The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to
have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished; and it
more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one
on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. They knew it
was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it--he would
only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty
Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand--so it
generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The
helmsman[1] used to stand by with tears in his eyes: _he_ knew it was all
wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, "_No one shall speak to the Man at
the Helm_," had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words "_and
the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one_." So remonstrance was
impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day.
During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards.

As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me, how to pronounce "slithy toves." The "i" in "slithy" is long, as
in "writhe"; and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves."
Again, the first "o" in "borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in
"borrow." I have heard people try to give it the sound of the "o" in
"worry." Such is Human Perversity.

     [1] This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found in it
     a refuge from the Baker's constant complaints about the insufficient
     blacking of his three pair of boots.

This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that
poem. Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a
portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.

For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious." Make up your mind
that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say
first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so
little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious"; if they turn, by
even a hair's breadth towards "furious," you will say "furious-fuming";
but if you have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will
say "frumious."

Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--

  "Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!"

Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,
but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he
would have gasped out "Rilchiam!"


Fit the First.

_THE LANDING._

  "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
    As he landed his crew with care;
  Supporting each man on the top of the tide
    By a finger entwined in his hair.

  "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
    That alone should encourage the crew.
  Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
    What I tell you three times is true."

  The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
  A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
    And a Broker, to value their goods.

[Illustration: "SUPPORTING EACH MAN ON THE TOP OF THE TIDE"]

  A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
    Might perhaps have won more than his share--
  But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
    Had the whole of their cash in his care.

  There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
    Or would sit making lace in the bow:
  And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
    Though none of the sailors knew how.

  There was one who was famed for the number of things
    He forgot when he entered the ship:
  His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
    And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

  He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
    With his name painted clearly on each:
  But since he omitted to mention the fact,
    They were all left behind on the beach.

  The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
    He had seven coats on when he came,
  With three pair of boots--but the worst of it was
    He had wholly forgotten his name.

[Illustration: "HE HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HIS NAME"]

  He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,
    Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"
  To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"
    But especially "Thing-um-a jig!"

  While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
    He had different names from these:
  His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"
    And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."

  "His form is ungainly--his intellect small--"
    (So the Bellman would often remark)--
  "But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,
    Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."

  He would joke with hyænas, returning their stare
    With an impudent wag of the head:
  And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
    "Just to keep up its spirits," he said.

  He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
    And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
  He could only bake Bride-cake--for which, I may state,
    No materials were to be had.

  The last of the crew needs especial remark,
    Though he looked an incredible dunce:
  He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"
    The good Bellman engaged him at once.

  He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
    When the ship had been sailing a week,
  He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
    And was almost too frightened to speak:

  But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
    There was only one Beaver on board;
  And that was a tame one he had of his own,
    Whose death would be deeply deplored.

  The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
    Protested, with tears in its eyes,
  That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
    Could atone for that dismal surprise!

  It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
    Conveyed in a separate ship:
  But the Bellman declared that would never agree
    With the plans he had made for the trip:

[Illustration: "THE BEAVER KEPT LOOKING THE OPPOSITE WAY"]

  Navigation was always a difficult art,
    Though with only one ship and one bell:
  And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
    Undertaking another as well.

  The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
    A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
  So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure
    Its life in some Office of note:

  This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
    (On moderate terms), or for sale,
  Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
    And one Against Damage From Hail.

  Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
    Whenever the Butcher was by,
  The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
    And appeared unaccountably shy.


Fit the Second.

_THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH._

  The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
    Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
  Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
    The moment one looked in his face!

  He had bought a large map representing the sea,
    Without the least vestige of land:
  And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
    A map they could all understand.

  "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
    Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"
  So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
    "They are merely conventional signs!

[Illustration: OCEAN-CHART.]

  "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
    But we've got our brave Captain to thank"
  (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought _us_ the best--
    A perfect and absolute blank!"

  This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out
    That the Captain they trusted so well
  Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
    And that was to tingle his bell.

  He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
    Were enough to bewilder a crew.
  When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"
    What on earth was the helmsman to do?

  Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
    A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
  That frequently happens in tropical climes,
    When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."

  But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
    And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
  Said he _had_ hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
    That the ship would _not_ travel due West!

  But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
    With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
  Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
    Which consisted of chasms and crags.

  The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
    And repeated in musical tone
  Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
    But the crew would do nothing but groan.

  He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
    And bade them sit down on the beach:
  And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
    As he stood and delivered his speech.

  "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!
    (They were all of them fond of quotations:
  So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers
    While he served out additional rations).

  "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
    (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
  But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
    Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

  "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
    (Seven days to the week I allow),
  But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
    We have never beheld till now!

  "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
    The five unmistakable marks
  By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
    The warranted genuine Snarks.

  "Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,
    Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
  Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
    With a flavour of Will-o-the wisp.

  "Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
    That it carries too far, when I say
  That it frequently breakfasts at five o'clock tea,
    And dines on the following day.

  "The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
    Should you happen to venture on one,
  It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
    And it always looks grave at a pun.

  "The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
    Which it constantly carries about,
  And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
    A sentiment open to doubt.

  "The fifth is ambition. It next will be right
    To describe each particular batch:
  Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
    From those that have whiskers, and scratch.

  "For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
    Yet I feel it my duty to say
  Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
    For the Baker had fainted away.


Fit the Third.

_THE BAKER'S TALE._

  They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
    They roused him with mustard and cress--
  They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
    They set him conundrums to guess.

  When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
    His sad story he offered to tell;
  And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!"
    And excitedly tingled his bell.

  There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream;
    Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
  As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe
    In an antediluvian tone.

  "My father and mother were honest, though poor--"
    "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.
  "If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
    We have hardly a minute to waste!"

  "I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,
    "And proceed without further remark
  To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
    To help you in hunting the Snark.

  "A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
    Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"
  "Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,
    As he angrily tingled his bell.

  "He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,
    "'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
  Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens
    And it's handy for striking a light.

  "'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;
    You may hunt it with forks and hope;
  You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
    You may charm it with smiles and soap--'"

  ("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold
    In a hasty parenthesis cried,
  "That's exactly the way I have always been told
    That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")

  "'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
    If your Snark be a Boojum! For then
  You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
    And never be met with again!'

  "It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
    When I think of my uncle's last words:
  And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
    Brimming over with quivering curds!

  "It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!"
    The Bellman indignantly said.
  And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.
    It is this, it is this that I dread!

  "I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
    In a dreamy delirious fight:
  I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
    And I use it for striking a light:

[Illustration: "BUT OH, BEAMISH NEPHEW, BEWARE OF THE DAY"]

  "But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
    In a moment (of this I am sure),
  I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
    And the notion I cannot endure!"


Fit the Fourth.

_THE HUNTING._

  The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.
    "If only you'd spoken before!
  It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
    With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

  "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
    If you never were met with again--
  But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
    You might have suggested it then?

  "It's excessively awkward to mention it now--
    As I think I've already remarked."
  And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,
    "I informed you the day we embarked.

  "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--
    (We are all of us weak at times):
  But the slightest approach to a false pretence
    Was never among my crimes!

  "I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--
    I said it in German and Greek:
  But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)
    That English is what you speak!"

  "'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face
    Had grown longer at every word:
  "But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,
    More debate would be simply absurd.

  "The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)
    "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.
  But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!
    'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!

  "To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;
    To pursue it with forks and hope;
  To threaten its life with a railway-share;
    To charm it with smiles and soap!

[Illustration: "TO PURSUE IT WITH FORKS AND HOPE."]

  "For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't
    Be caught in a commonplace way.
  Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:
    Not a chance must be wasted to-day!

  "For England expects--I forbear to proceed:
    'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:
  And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need
    To rig yourselves out for the fight."

  Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),
    And changed his loose silver for notes:
  The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
    And shook the dust out of his coats:

  The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
    Each working the grindstone in turn:
  But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
    No interest in the concern:

  Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
    And vainly proceeded to cite
  A number of cases, in which making laces
    Had been proved an infringement of right.

  The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
    A novel arrangement of bows:
  While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand
    Was chalking the tip of his nose.

  But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
    With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--
  Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
    Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."

  "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,
    "If we happen to meet it together!"
  And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
    Said "That must depend on the weather."

  The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
    At seeing the Butcher so shy:
  And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,
    Made an effort to wink with one eye.

  "Be a man!" cried the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
    The Butcher beginning to sob.
  "Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,
    We shall need all our strength for the job!"


Fit the Fifth.

_THE BEAVER'S LESSON._

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap.

  Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
    For making a separate sally;
  And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
    A dismal and desolate valley.

  But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
    It had chosen the very same place:
  Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
    The disgust that appeared in his face.

  Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
    And the glorious work of the day;
  And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
    That the other was going that way.

  But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
    And the evening got darker and colder,
  Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)
    They marched along shoulder to shoulder.

  Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
    And they knew that some danger was near:
  The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
    And even the Butcher felt queer.

  He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
    That blissful and innocent state--
  The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
    A pencil that squeaks on a slate!

  "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.
    (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")
  "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,
    "I have uttered that sentiment once."

  "'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
    You will find I have told it you twice.
  'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
    If only I've stated it thrice."

  The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
    Attending to every word:
  But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
    When the third repetition occurred.

  It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
    It had somehow contrived to lose count,
  And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
    By reckoning up the amount.

  "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"
    It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs!"
  Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
    It had taken no pains with its sums.

  "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.
    The thing must be done, I am sure.
  The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,
    The best there is time to procure."

  The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
    And ink in unfailing supplies:
  While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
    And watched them with wondering eyes.

  So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
    As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
  And explained all the while in a popular style
    Which the Beaver could well understand.

  "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
    A convenient number to state--
  We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
    By One Thousand diminished by Eight.

  "The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
    By Nine-Hundred-and-Ninety-and-Two:
  Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
    Exactly and perfectly true.

  "The method employed I would gladly explain,
    While I have it so clear in my head,
  If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
    But much yet remains to be said.

[Illustration: "THE BEAVER BROUGHT PAPER, PORTFOLIO, PENS"]

  "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
    Enveloped in absolute mystery,
  And without extra charge I will give you at large
    A Lesson in Natural History."

  In his genial way he proceeded to say
    (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
  And that giving instruction, without introduction,
    Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

  "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
    Since it lives in perpetual passion:
  Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
    It is ages ahead of the fashion:

  "But it knows any friend it has met once before:
    It never will look at a bribe:
  And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
    And collects--though it does not subscribe.

  "Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
    Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
  (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
    And some, in mahogany kegs:)

  "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
    You condense it with locusts and tape:
  Still keeping one principal object in view--
    To preserve its symmetrical shape."

  The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
    But he felt that the Lesson must end,
  And he wept with delight in attempting to say
    He considered the Beaver his friend:

  While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
    More eloquent even than tears,
  It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
    Would have taught it in seventy years.

  They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
    (For a moment) with noble emotion,
  Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days
    We have spent on the billowy ocean!"

  Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
    Have seldom if ever been known;
  In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
    You could never meet either alone.

  And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
    Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--
  The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
    And cemented their friendship for ever!


Fit the Sixth.

_THE BARRISTER'S DREAM._

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap.

  But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
    That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
  Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
    That his fancy had dwelt on so long.

  He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
    Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
  Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
    On the charge of deserting its sty.

[Illustration: "'YOU MUST KNOW--' SAID THE JUDGE: BUT THE SNARK EXCLAIMED
'FUDGE!'"]

  The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
    That the sty was deserted when found:
  And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
    In a soft under-current of sound.

  The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
    And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
  And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
    What the pig was supposed to have done.

  The Jury had each formed a different view
    (Long before the indictment was read),
  And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
    One word that the others had said.

  "You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!
    That statute is obsolete quite!
  Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
    On an ancient manorial right.

  "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
    To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
  While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
    If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'

  "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:
    But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
  (So far as relates to the costs of this suit)
    By the Alibi which has been proved.

  "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes."
    Here the speaker sat down in his place,
  And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
    And briefly to sum up the case.

  But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
    So the Snark undertook it instead,
  And summed it so well that it came to far more
    Than the Witnesses ever had said!

  When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
    As the word was so puzzling to spell;
  But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
    Undertaking that duty as well.

  So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
    It was spent with the toils of the day:
  When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned
    And some of them fainted away.

  Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
    Too nervous to utter a word:
  When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
    And the fall of a pin might be heard.

  "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,
    "And _then_ to be fined forty pound."
  The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
    That the phrase was not legally sound.

  But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
    When the jailer informed them, with tears,
  Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
    As the pig had been dead for some years.

  The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
    But the Snark, though a little aghast,
  As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,
    Went bellowing on to the last.

  Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
    To grow every moment more clear:
  Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
    Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.


Fit the Seventh.

_THE BANKER'S FATE._

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap.

  And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
    It was matter for general remark,
  Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
    In his zeal to discover the Snark.

  But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
    A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
  And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
    For he knew it was useless to fly.

  He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
    (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
  But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
    And grabbed at the Banker again.

  Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
    Went savagely snapping around--
  He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
    Till fainting he fell to the ground.

  The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
    Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
  And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"
    And solemnly tolled on his bell.

  He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
    The least likeness to what he had been:
  While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--
    A wonderful thing to be seen!

[Illustration: "SO GREAT WAS HIS FRIGHT THAT HIS WAISTCOAT TURNED WHITE."]

  To the horror of all who were present that day,
    He uprose in full evening dress,
  And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
    What his tongue could no longer express.

  Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
    And chanted in mimsiest tones
  Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
    While he rattled a couple of bones.

  "Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!"
    The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
  "We have lost half the day. Any further delay,
    And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!"


Fit the Eighth.

_THE VANISHING._

  They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
    They pursued it with forks and hope;
  They threatened its life with a railway-share;
    They charmed it with smiles and soap.

  They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
    And the Beaver, excited at last,
  Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
    For the daylight was nearly past.

  "There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said.
    "He is shouting like mad, only hark!
  He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
    He has certainly found a Snark!"

  They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
    "He was always a desperate wag!"
  They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--
    On the top of a neighbouring crag,

  Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.
    In the next, that wild figure they saw
  (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
    While they waited and listened in awe.

  "It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,
    And seemed almost too good to be true.
  Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
    Then the ominous words "It's a Boo--"

  Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air
    A weary and wandering sigh
  That sounded like "--jum!" but the others declare
    It was only a breeze that went by.

[Illustration: "THEN, SILENCE"]

  They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
    Not a button, or feather, or mark,
  By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
    Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

  In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
    In the midst of his laughter and glee,
  He had softly and suddenly vanished away--
    For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.




SIZE AND TEARS.

[Illustration]


  When on the sandy shore I sit,
    Beside the salt sea-wave,
  And fall into a weeping fit
    Because I dare not shave--
  A little whisper at my ear
  Enquires the reason of my fear.

  I answer "If that ruffian Jones
    Should recognise me here,
  He'd bellow out my name in tones
    Offensive to the ear:
  He chaffs me so on being stout
  (A thing that always puts me out)."

  Ah me! I see him on the cliff!
    Farewell, farewell to hope,
  If he should look this way, and if
    He's got his telescope!
  To whatsoever place I flee,
  My odious rival follows me!

  For every night, and everywhere,
    I meet him out at dinner;
  And when I've found some charming fair,
    And vowed to die or win her,
  The wretch (he's thin and I am stout)
  Is sure to come and cut me out!

[Illustration: "HE'S THIN AND I AM STOUT"]

  The girls (just like them!) all agree
    To praise J. Jones, Esquire:
  I ask them what on earth they see
    About him to admire?
  They cry "He is so sleek and slim,
  It's quite a treat to look at him!"

  They vanish in tobacco smoke,
    Those visionary maids--
  I feel a sharp and sudden poke
    Between the shoulder-blades--
  "Why, Brown, my boy! You're growing stout!"
  (I told you he would find me out!)

  "My growth is not _your_ business, Sir!"
    "No more it is, my boy!
  But if it's _yours_, as I infer,
    Why, Brown, I give you joy!
  A man, whose business prospers so,
  Is just the sort of man to know!

  "It's hardly safe, though, talking here--
    I'd best get out of reach:
  For such a weight as yours, I fear,
    Must shortly sink the beach!"--

  Insult me thus because I'm stout!
  I vow I'll go and call him out!

ATALANTA IN CAMDEN-TOWN.


            Ay, 'twas here, on this spot,
              In that summer of yore,
            Atalanta did not
              Vote my presence a bore,
  Nor reply to my tenderest talk "She had heard all that nonsense before."

            She'd the brooch I had bought
              And the necklace and sash on,
            And her heart, as I thought,
              Was alive to my passion;
  And she'd done up her hair in the style that the Empress had brought
    into fashion.

[Illustration]

            I had been to the play
              With my pearl of a Peri--
            But, for all I could say,
              She declared she was weary,
  That "the place was so crowded and hot, and she couldn't abide that
    Dundreary."

            Then I thought "'Tis for me
              That she whines and she whimpers!"
            And it soothed me to see
              Those sensational simpers,
  And I said "This is scrumptious!"--a phrase I had learned from the
    Devonshire shrimpers.

            And I vowed "'Twill be said
              I'm a fortunate fellow,
            When the breakfast is spread,
              When the topers are mellow,
  When the foam of the bride-cake is white, and the fierce orange-blossoms
    are yellow!"

            O that languishing yawn!
              O those eloquent eyes!
            I was drunk with the dawn
              Of a splendid surmise--
  I was stung by a look, I was slain by a tear, by a tempest of sighs.

            And I whispered "'Tis time!
              Is not Love at its deepest?
            Shall we squander Life's prime,
              While thou waitest and weepest?
  Let us settle it, License or Banns?--though undoubtedly Banns are the
    cheapest."

            "Ah, my Hero," said I,
              "Let me be thy Leander!"
            But I lost her reply--
              Something ending with "gander"--
  For the omnibus rattled so loud that no mortal could quite understand
    her.




THE LANG COORTIN'.


  The ladye she stood at her lattice high,
      Wi' her doggie at her feet;
  Thorough the lattice she can spy
      The passers in the street.

  "There's one that standeth at the door,
      And tirleth at the pin:
  Now speak and say, my popinjay,
      If I sall let him in."

  Then up and spake the popinjay
      That flew abune her head:
  "Gae let him in that tirls the pin:
      He cometh thee to wed."

  O when he cam' the parlour in,
      A woeful man was he!
  "And dinna ye ken your lover agen,
      Sae well that loveth thee?"

[Illustration]

  "And how wad I ken ye loved me, Sir,
      That have been sae lang away?
  And how wad I ken ye loved me, Sir?
      Ye never telled me sae."

  Said--"Ladye dear," and the salt, salt tear
      Cam' rinnin' doon his cheek,
  "I have sent thee tokens of my love
      This many and many a week.

  "O didna ye get the rings, Ladye,
      The rings o' the gowd sae fine?
  I wot that I have sent to thee
      Four score, four score and nine."

  "They cam' to me," said that fair ladye.
      "Wow, they were flimsie things!"
  Said--"that chain o' gowd, my doggie to howd,
      It is made o' thae self-same rings."

  "And didna ye get the locks, the locks,
      The locks o' my ain black hair,
  Whilk I sent by post, whilk I sent by box,
      Whilk I sent by the carrier?"

  "They cam' to me," said that fair ladye;
      "And I prithee send nae mair!"
  Said--"that cushion sae red, for my doggie's head,
      It is stuffed wi' thae locks o' hair."

  "And didna ye get the letter, Ladye,
      Tied wi' a silken string,
  Whilk I sent to thee frae the far countrie,
      A message of love to bring?"

  "It cam' to me frae the far countrie
      Wi' its silken string and a';
  But it wasna prepaid," said that high-born maid,
      "Sae I gar'd them tak' it awa'."

  "O ever alack that ye sent it back,
      It was written sae clerkly and well!
  Now the message it brought, and the boon that it sought,
      I must even say it mysel'."

  Then up and spake the popinjay,
      Sae wisely counselled he.
  "Now say it in the proper way:
      Gae doon upon thy knee!"

  The lover he turned baith red and pale,
      Went doon upon his knee:
  "O Ladye, hear the waesome tale
      That must be told to thee!

  "For five lang years, and five lang years,
      I coorted thee by looks;
  By nods and winks, by smiles and tears,
      As I had read in books.

  "For ten lang years, O weary hours!
      I coorted thee by signs;
  By sending game, by sending flowers,
      By sending Valentines.

  "For five lang years, and five lang years,
      I have dwelt in the far countrie,
  Till that thy mind should be inclined
      Mair tenderly to me.

  "Now thirty years are gane and past,
      I am come frae a foreign land:
  I am come to tell thee my love at last--
      O Ladye, gie me thy hand!"

  The ladye she turned not pale nor red,
      But she smiled a pitiful smile:
  "Sic' a coortin' as yours, my man," she said
      "Takes a lang and a weary while!"

  And out and laughed the popinjay,
      A laugh of bitter scorn:
  "A coortin' done in sic' a way,
      It ought not to be borne!"

  Wi' that the doggie barked aloud,
      And up and doon he ran,
