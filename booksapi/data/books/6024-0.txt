SCENE I


                                _The Vatican_

                       _Enter_ CÆSAR _and_ VANNOZZA

                                  CÆSAR

   Now, mother, though thou love my brother more,
   Am I not more thy son than he?

                                 VANNOZZA

         Not more.

                                  CÆSAR

   Have I more Spaniard in me—less of thee?
   Did our Most Holiest father thrill thy womb
   With more Italian passion than brought forth
   Me?

                                 VANNOZZA

      Child, thine elder never was as thou—
   Spake never thus.

                                  CÆSAR

         I doubt it not.  But I,
   Mother, am not mine elder.  He desires
   And he enjoys the life God gives him—God,
   The Pope our father, and thy sacred self,
   Mother beloved and hallowed.  I desire
   More.

                                 VANNOZZA

      Thou wast ever sleepless as the wind—
   A child anhungered for thy time to be
   Man.  See thy purple about thee.  Art thou not
   Cardinal?

                                  CÆSAR

      Ay; my father’s eminence
   Set so the stamp on mine.  I will not die
   Cardinal.

                                 VANNOZZA

      Cæsar, wilt thou cleave my heart?
   Have I not loved thee?

                                  CÆSAR

         Ay, fair mother—ay.
   Thou hast loved my father likewise.  Dost thou love
   Giulia—the sweet Farnese—called the Fair
   In all the Roman streets that call thee Rose?
   And that bright babe Giovanni, whom our sire,
   Thy holy lord and hers, hath stamped at birth
   As duke of Nepi?

                                 VANNOZZA

         When thy sire begat
   Thee, sinful though he ever was—fierce, fell,
   Spaniard—I fear me, Jesus for his sins
   Bade Satan pass into him.

                                  CÆSAR

            And fill thee full,
   Sweet sinless mother.  Fear it not.  Thou hast
   Children more loved of him and thee than me—
   Our bright Francesco, born to smile and sway,
   And her whose face makes pale the sun in heaven,
   Whose eyes outlaugh the splendour of the sea,
   Whose hair has all noon’s wonders in its weft,
   Whose mouth is God’s and Italy’s one rose,
   Lucrezia.

                                 VANNOZZA

      Dost thou love them then?  My child,
   How should not I then love thee?

                                  CÆSAR

            God alone
   Knows.  Was not God—the God of love, who bade
   His son be man because he hated man,
   And saw him scourged and hanging, and at last
   Forgave the sin wherewith he had stamped us, seeing
   So fair a full atonement—was not God
   Bridesman when Christ’s crowned vicar took to bride
   My mother?

                                 VANNOZZA

         Speak not thou to me of God.
   I have sinned, I have sinned—I would I had died a nun,
   Cloistered!

                                  CÆSAR

      There too my sire had found thee.  Priests
   Make way where warriors dare not—save when war
   Sets wide the floodgates of the weirs of hell.
   And what hast thou to do with sin?  Hath he
   Whose sin was thine not given thee there and then
   God’s actual absolution?  Mary lived
   God’s virgin, and God’s mother: mine art thou,
   Who am Christlike even as thou art virginal.
   And if thou love me or love me not God knows,
   And God, who made me and my sire and thee,
   May take the charge upon him.  I am I.
   Somewhat I think to do before my day
   Pass from me.  Did I love thee not at all,
   I would not bid thee know it.

                                 VANNOZZA

            Alas, my son!

                                  CÆSAR

   Alas, my mother, sounds no sense for men—
   Rings but reverberate folly, whence resounds
   Returning laughter.  Weep or smile on me,
   Thy sunshine or thy rainbow softens not
   The mortal earth wherein thou hast clad me.  Nay,
   But rather would I see thee smile than weep,
   Mother.  Thou art lovelier, smiling.

                                 VANNOZZA

            What is this
   Thou hast at heart to do?  God’s judgment hangs
   Above us.  I that girdled thee in me
   As Mary girdled Jesus yet unborn
   —Thou dost believe it?  A creedless heretic
   Thou art not?

                                  CÆSAR

         I?  God’s vicar’s child?

                                 VANNOZZA

            Be God
   Praised!  I, then, I, thy mother, bid thee, pray,
   Pray thee but say what hungers in thy heart,
   And whither thou wouldst hurl the strenuous life
   That works within thee.

                                  CÆSAR

         Whither?  Am not I
   Hinge of the gate that opens heaven—that bids
   God open when my sire thrusts in the key—
   Cardinal?  Canst thou dream I had rather be
   Duke?

                            _Enter_ FRANCESCO

                                FRANCESCO

      Wilt thou take mine office, Cæsar mine?
   I heard thy laugh deride it.  Mother, whence
   Comes that sweet gift of grace from dawn to dawn
   That daily shows thee sweeter?

                                  CÆSAR

            Knowest thou none
   Lovelier?

                                 VANNOZZA

      My Cæsar finds me not so fair.
   Thou art over fond, Francesco.

                                  CÆSAR

            Nay, no whit.
   Our heavenly father on earth adores no less
   Our mother than our sister: and I hold
   His heart and eye, his spirit and his sense,
   Infallible.

                              Enter the POPE

                                ALEXANDER

         Jest not with God.  I heard
   A holy word, a hallowing epithet,
   Cardinal Cæsar, trip across thy tongue
   Lightly.

                                  CÆSAR

      Most holiest father, I desire
   Paternal absolution—when thy laugh
   Has waned from lip and eyelid.

                                ALEXANDER

            Take it now,
   And Christ preserve thee, Cæsar, as thou art,
   To serve him as I serve him.  Rose of mine,
   My rose of roses, whence has fallen this dew
   That dims the sweetest eyes love ever lit
   With light that mocks the morning?

                                 VANNOZZA

            Nay, my lord,
   I know not—nay, I knew not if I wept.

                                ALEXANDER

   Our sons and Christ’s and Peter’s whom we praise,
   Are they—are these—fallen out?

                                FRANCESCO

            Not I with him,
   Nor he, I think, with me.

                                  CÆSAR

         Forbid it, God!
   The God that set thee where thou art, and there
   Sustains thee, bids the love he kindles bind
   Brother to brother.

                                ALEXANDER

         God or no God, man
   Must live and let man live—while one man’s life
   Galls not another’s.  Fools and fiends are men
   Who play the fiend that is not.  Why shouldst thou,
   Girt with the girdle of the church, and given
   Power to preside on spirit and flesh—or thou,
   Clothed with the glad world’s glory—priest or prince,
   Turn on thy brother an evil eye, or deem
   Your father God hath dealt his doom amiss
   Toward either or toward any?  Hath not Rome,
   Hath not the Lord Christ’s kingdom, where his will
   Is done on earth, enough of all that man
   Thirsts, hungers, lusts for—pleasure, pride, and power—
   To sate you and to share between you?  Whence
   Should she, the godless heathen’s goddess once,
   Discord, heave up her hissing head again
   Between love’s Christian children—love’s?  Hath God
   Cut short the thrill that glorifies the flesh,
   Chilled the sharp rapturous pang that burns the blood,
   Because an hundred even as twain at once
   Partake it?  Boys, my boys, be wise, and rest,
   Whatever fire take hold upon your flesh,
   Whatever dream set all your life on fire,
   Friends.

                                  CÆSAR

      Friends?  Our father on earth, thy will be done.

                                FRANCESCO

   Christ’s body, Cæsar! dost thou mock?

                                  CÆSAR

            Not I.
   Hast thou fallen out with me, then, that thy tongue
   Disclaims its lingering utterance?

                                ALEXANDER

         Now, by nought,
   As nought abides to swear by, folly seen
   So plain and heard so loud might well nigh make
   Wise men believe in even the devil and God.
   What ails you?  Whence comes lightning in your eyes,
   With hissing hints of thunder on your lips?
   Fools! and the fools I thought to make for men
   Gods.  Is it love or hate divides you—turns
   Tooth, fang, or claw, when time provides them prey,
   To nip, rip, rend each other?

                                  CÆSAR

            Hate or love,
   Francesco?

                                FRANCESCO

         Why, I hate thee not—thou knowest
   I hate thee not, my Cæsar.

                                  CÆSAR

            I believe
   Thou dost not hate or love or envy me;
   Even as I know, and knowing believe, we all—
   Our father, thou and I—triune in heart—
   Hold loveliest of all living things to love
   This.

                             _Enter_ LUCREZIA

                                 LUCREZIA

   Mother!  What do tears and thou for once
   Together?  Rain in sunshine?

                                 VANNOZZA

            Ask thy sire,
   Am I not now the moon?  Saint Anna bore
   Saint Mary Virgin—did not God prefer
   The child, and thrust behind with scarce a smile
   The mother?

                                ALEXANDER

         Thrust not out thy thorns at heaven,
   Rose.

                                 LUCREZIA

      But what ailed her?  And she will not say.

                                  CÆSAR

   Sister, I sinned—sin must be mine.  A word
   Fell out askance between us, and she wept
   Because our father chid us.

                                 LUCREZIA

            How should strife
   Find here a tongue to hiss with?  Are not we,
   Brothers and sire and sister, sealed of God
   Lovers—made one in love?

                                ALEXANDER

            Deride not God,
   Lucrezia.

                                 LUCREZIA

      Father, dost thou fear him, then?

                                ALEXANDER

   I say not and I know not if I fear.

                                FRANCESCO

   Thou canst not.  Father, were he terrible,
   How long wouldst thou live—thou, his mask on earth?

                                ALEXANDER

   Boy, art thou all a child?  What knew they more,
   The men that loved and feared and died for God,
   Than I and thou who know him not?  We know
   This life is ours, and sweet, if shame and fear
   Make us not less than man: and less were they
   Who crawled and writhed and cowered and called on God
   To save them from him.  Here I stand as he,
   God, or God’s very figure wrought in flesh,
   More godlike than was Jesus.  Dare I fear
   Whipping and hanging?  Thou, my cardinal,
   Canst think not to be scourged and crucified—
   Ha?

                                  CÆSAR

      Nay: there lurks no God in me.  And thou,
   Father, dost thou fear?

                                ALEXANDER

         I?  Nought less than God.
   But if we take him lightly on our lips
   Too light his name will sound in all men’s ears
   Till earth and air, when man says God, respond
   Laughter.  Forbear him.

                                  CÆSAR

         Wisdom lives in thee,
   And cries not out along the streets as when
   None of God’s folk that heard regarded her,
   As all that hear thy word regard—or die,
   Being not outside God’s eyeshot.  Dost thou sleep
   Here in his special keeping—here—to-night,
   Brother?

                                FRANCESCO

      What bids thee care to know?

                                  CÆSAR

            They say
   These holy streets of heaven’s most holiest choice
   Lie dangerous now in darkness if a man
   Walk not on holiest errands.  Thou, they say,
   Wert scarce a Christlike sacrifice if slain.
   Too many dead flow down the Tiber’s flow
   Nightly.  They say it.

                                FRANCESCO

            I never called thee yet
   Fool.

                                  CÆSAR

      Ah, my lord and brother, didst thou now,
   Were this not thankless?  God—our father’s God—
   Guide thee!

                                                        [_Exit_ FRANCESCO.

      He goes, and thanks me not.  Our sire,
   What says the God that lives upon thy lips
   And withers in thy silence?

                                 LUCREZIA

         Vex him not,
   Cæsar.  Thou seest he is weary.

                                ALEXANDER

            Yea.  Come ye
   With me.  Bethink thee, Cæsar.  Vex me not.

              _Exeunt_ ALEXANDER, VANNOZZA, _and_ LUCREZIA.

                                  CÆSAR

   Thou wilt not bid me this, I think, again,
   Father.

                            _Enter_ MICHELOTTO

      Thou art swift of speed at need.  I bade thee
   Abide my bidding.

                                MICHELOTTO

         Till my lord were left
   Alone.

                                  CÆSAR

      Thou knewest it?

                                MICHELOTTO

         Where my lord may be
   And what beseems his thrall to know of him
   I were not worthy, knew I not, to know.

                                  CÆSAR

   I do not ask thee where my brother sleeps.
   And where to-morrow sees him yet asleep—

                                MICHELOTTO

   Ask of the fishers’ nets on Tiber.

                                  CÆSAR

            Nay—
   Not I but Rome shall ask it.  Pass in peace.
   The benediction of my sire be thine.

                                                                [_Exeunt_.




SCENE II


                  _A narrow street opening on the Tiber_

                    _Enter_ MICHELOTTO _and_ ASSASSINS

                                MICHELOTTO

   Ye know the lordlier harlot’s house—there?

                              FIRST ASSASSIN

            Ay,
   Surely.

                                MICHELOTTO

      The first whose foot comes forth is he.

                             SECOND ASSASSIN

   How know we this?

                                MICHELOTTO

         I know it.  Ye need but slay.

                                                                  [_Exit_.

                            _Enter_ FRANCESCO

                          FRANCESCO (_singing_)

   Love and night are life and light;
      Sleep and wine and song
   Speed and slay the halting day
      Ere it live too long.

                              FIRST ASSASSIN

   That shalt not thou.  Sing, whosoe’er thou be,
   Thy next of songs to Satan.

                                                         [_They stab him_.

                                FRANCESCO

         Dogs!  Ye dare?
   God!  Pity me!  God!

                                                                  [_Dies_.

                             SECOND ASSASSIN

         God receive his soul!
   This was a Christian: many a man I have slain
   Died with all hell between his lips.

                              FIRST ASSASSIN

            Be thine
   Dumb.  Lift his feet as I the head.

                             SECOND ASSASSIN

            A boy!
   And fair of face as angels

                              FIRST ASSASSIN

            If the nets
   Snare not this fish betimes ere others feed,
   None that shall heave it airward for the sun
   To mock and mar shall say so.  Bring him down.
   Tiber hath fed on choicer fare than we
   May think to feed his throat with ere we die.

                                                  [_Exeunt with the body_.




SCENE III


                              _The Vatican_

                          ALEXANDER and LUCREZIA

                                ALEXANDER

   The day burns high.  Thou hast not seen them—thou?

                                 LUCREZIA

   My brethren, sire?  Nay, not since yesternight.

                                ALEXANDER

   The night is newly dead.  Since yestereven?

                                 LUCREZIA

   Nor then.  I saw them when we parted here
   Last.

                                ALEXANDER

      I believe thou liest not.  Girl, the day
   Looks pale before thy glory.  Brow, cheek, eye,
   Lips, throat, and bosom, thou dost overshine
   All womanhood man ever worshipped.  Once
   I held thy mother fairest born of all
   That ever turned old Rome to heaven.  Thou hast read
   Her golden Horace?

                                 LUCREZIA

         Else were I cast out
   From all their choir who serve the Muses.

                                ALEXANDER

            Ay.
   ‘Fair mother’s fairer daughter,’ dost thou deem
   That praise was ever merited as by thee?
   I cannot.

                                 LUCREZIA

      I concern myself no whit
   If so it were or were not.

                                ALEXANDER

            Thou dost well.
   Thou hast not seen, thou sayest, Francesco?

                                 LUCREZIA

            Nay—
   Give me some reliquary to swear it on—
   Some rosary—crucifix or amulet,
   Sorcerous or sacred.

                                ALEXANDER

         Never twins were born
   More like than thou and he—nor lovelier: yet
   No twins were ye.

                                 LUCREZIA

         What ails thy Holiness?

                                ALEXANDER

   I am ill at ease: my heart is sick.  Last night
   No revel here was held, and yet the day
   Strikes heavier on me wearier, body and soul,
   Than though we had rioted out with raging mirth
   The lifelong length of darkness.

                                 LUCREZIA

            Evil hours
   Fret somewhiles all folk living; none sees why:
   No child sleeps always all night long.

                                ALEXANDER

            Wast thou
   Wakeful?  No trouble clung about thee?  Nought
   Made the air of night heavier with presage felt
   As joy feels fear and withers?  I am not
   Afraid: methinks I am very fear itself.

                   _Enter an Officer of the household_

                                 OFFICER

   His holiness be gracious towards me.

                                ALEXANDER

            Speak.
   Thy face is death’s: let death upon thy lips
   Live.

                                 OFFICER

      Sire, the humblest hireling knave in Rome—
   A waterman that plies his craft all night—
   Craves audience even of thee.

                                ALEXANDER

         A Roman?

                                 OFFICER

            Nay.
   Some outlander—some Greek—they call the knave
   George the Slavonian.

                                ALEXANDER

      They?

                                 OFFICER

            The fisherfolk
   On Tiber.

                                ALEXANDER

      Bid him in: bid God himself
   Come in with doom upon me.

                                                          [_Exit Officer_.

            Hear’st thou, child—
   Daughter?

                                 LUCREZIA

      What horror hangs on thee?

                                ALEXANDER

            Abide,
   And thou shalt know as I know.

                        _Enter_ GIORGIO SCHIAVONE

            Speak.  I say,
   Speak.  What thou art I know: and what I am
   Thou knowest—and yet thou knowest not.

                                 GIORGIO

         Holiest sire,
   Last night I kept my boat on Tiber—Sire,
   The thing I saw was nothing of my deed—
   It shook me out of sleep to see it—Lord,
   Have mercy: look not so upon me.

                                ALEXANDER

            Dog,
   Speak, while thy tongue is thine.

                                 GIORGIO

         Two men came down
   And peered along the water-side: and two
   Came after—men whose eyes raked all the night,
   Searching the shore—I lay beneath my boat—
   Beside it on the darkling side—and saw.
   Then came a horseman—Sire, his horse was white—
   The moonshine made his mane like dull white fire—
   And on his crupper heavily hung a corpse,
   Arms held from swaying on this side, legs on that,
   I know not which on either—but the men
   Held fast that held: and hard on Tiber side
   They swung the crupper towards the water—sharp
   And swift as man may steer a horse—and caught
   And slung their dead into the stream: and he
   Drifted, and caught the moon across his face
   That shone like life against it: and the chief
   Till then sat silent as the moon at watch,
   And then bade hurl stones on the drifting dead
   And sink him out of sight; and seeing this done,
   Rode thence, and they strode after.

                                ALEXANDER

            Man, and thou—
   Thou?

                                 GIORGIO

      Sire, I set my heart again to sleep:
   I turned and slept under my boatside.

                                ALEXANDER

            Man—
   Dog—devil, if this be truth, and if my fear
   Lie not—how hadst thou heart to hold thy peace?
   How comes it that the warders of the shore
   Knew not of thee, while yet the crime was hot,
   What crime had made night hell?

                                 GIORGIO

         A thousand times
   I have seen such sights, but never till this hour
   Seen him who cared to hear of them.

                                ALEXANDER

            Till now,
   Never.  He looks in God’s mute face and mine,
   And says it.  God be good to me!  But God
   Will not—or is not.  Where is then thy dead,
   Devil, called of God from hell to smite—to scourge—
   Me?

                                 GIORGIO

      Sire, at hand I left him.

                                ALEXANDER

            Stir not.  Bid
   Thy fellows bring my dead before me.

                                                          [_Exit Officer_.

               Nay,
   But mine it is not yet—it may not be
   Mine—while it may not be, it is not.  Child,
   It shall not be thy brother.  Pray no prayer.
   Prayer never yet brought profit.  Be not pale.
   Fear strikes more deep into the fearful heart
   The wound it heals not.

                Enter Officers with the body of FRANCESCO

         What is he they bring?
   O God!  Thou livest!  And my child is dead!

                                                                 [_Falls_.




SCENE IV


                              _The Vatican_

                          ALEXANDER _and_ CÆSAR

                                ALEXANDER

   Thou hast done this deed.

                                  CÆSAR

      Thou hast said it.

                                ALEXANDER

         Dost thou think
   To live, and look upon me?

                                  CÆSAR

            Some while yet.

                                ALEXANDER

   I would there were a God—that he might hear.

                                  CÆSAR

   ’Tis pity there should be—for thy sake—none.

                                ALEXANDER

   Wilt thou slay me?

                                  CÆSAR

      Why?

                                ALEXANDER

            Am not I thy sire?

                                  CÆSAR

   And Christendom’s to boot.

                                ALEXANDER

            I pray thee, man,
   Slay me.

                                  CÆSAR

         And then myself?  Thou art crazed, but I
   Sane.

                                ALEXANDER

      Art thou very flesh and blood?

                                  CÆSAR

               They say,
   Thine.

                                ALEXANDER

      If the heaven stand still and smite thee not,
   There is no God indeed.

                                  CÆSAR

            Nor thou nor I
   Know.

                                ALEXANDER

      I could pray to God that God might be,
   Were I but mad.  Thou sayest I am mad: thou liest:
   I do not pray.

                                  CÆSAR

         Most holiest father, no.
   Thy brain is not so sick yet.  Thou and God
   Friends?  Man, how long would God have let thee live—
   Thee?

                                ALEXANDER

      Long enough he hath kept me, to behold
   His face as fire—if his it be—and earth
   As hell—and thee, begotten of my loins,
   Satan.

                                  CÆSAR

         The firstfruits of thy fatherhood
   Were something less than Satan.  Man of God,
   Vaunt not thyself.

                                ALEXANDER

            I would I had died in the womb.

                                  CÆSAR

   Thou shalt do better, dying in Peter’s chair:
   Thou shalt die famous.

                                ALEXANDER

         Ay: no screen from that,
   No shelter, no forgetfulness on earth.
   We shall be famed for ever.  Hell and night,
   Cover me!

                                  CÆSAR

      Hast thou heard that prayers are heard?
   Or hast thou known earth, for a man’s cry’s sake,
   Cleave, and devour him?

                                ALEXANDER

            I have done this thing.
   Thou hast not done it: thy deed is none of thine:
   Upon my hand, upon my head, the blood
   Rests.

                                  CÆSAR

      Wilt thou sleep the worse for this next year?

                                ALEXANDER

   I will not live a seven days’ space beyond
   This.

                                  CÆSAR

      Thou hast lived thy seven days’ space in hell,
   Father: they say thou hast fasted even from sleep.

                                ALEXANDER

   Ay.

                                  CÆSAR

      What they say and what thou sayest I hold
   False.  Though thou hast wept as woman, howled as wolf,
   Above our dead, thou art hale and whole.  And now
   Behoves thee rise again as Christ our God,
   Vicarious Christ, and cast as flesh away
   This grief from off thy godhead.  I and thou,
   One, will set hand as never God hath set
   To the empire and the steerage of the world.
   Do thou forget but him who is dead, and was
   Nought, and bethink thee what a world to wield
   The eternal God hath given into thine hands
   Which daily mould him out of bread, and give
   His kneaded flesh to feed on.  Thou and I
   Will make this rent and ruinous Italy
   One.  Ours it shall be, body and soul, and great
   Above all power and glory given of God
   To them that died to set thee where thou art—
   Throned on the dust of Cæsar and of Christ,
   Imperial.  Earth shall quail again, and rise
   Again the higher because she trembled.  Rome
   So bade it be: it was, and shall be.

                                ALEXANDER

               Son,
   Art thou my son?

                                  CÆSAR

         Whom should thy radiant Rose
   Have found so fit to ingraff with, and bring forth
   So strong a scion as I am?

                                ALEXANDER

            By my faith—
   Wherein, I know not—by my soul, if that
   Be—I believe it.  God forgot his doom
   When he thou hast slain drew breath before thee

                                  CÆSAR

               God
   Must needs forget—if God remember.  Now
   This thing thou hast loved, and I that swept him hence
   Held never fit for hate of mine, is dead,
   Wilt thou be one with me—one God?  No less,
   Lord Christ of Rome, thou wilt be.

                                ALEXANDER

            Ay?  The Dove?

                                  CÆSAR

   What dove, though lovelier than the swan that lured
   Leda to love of God on earth, might match
   Lucrezia?

                                ALEXANDER

      None.  Thou art subtle of soul and strong.
   I would thou hadst spared him—couldst have spared him.

                                  CÆSAR

         Sire,
   I would so too.  Our sire, his sire and mine,
   I slew not him for lust of slaying, or hate,
   Or aught less like thy wiser spirit and mine.

                                ALEXANDER

   Not for the dove’s sake?

                                  CÆSAR

         Not for hate or love.
   Death was the lot God bade him draw, if God
   Be more than what we make him.

                                ALEXANDER

               Bread and wine
   Could hardly turn so bitter.  Canst thou sleep?

                                  CÆSAR

   Dost thou not?  Flesh must sleep to live.  Am I
   No son of thine?

                                ALEXANDER

            I would I saw thine end,
   And mine: and yet I would not.

                                  CÆSAR

               Sire, good night.

                                                                 [_Exeunt_

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
