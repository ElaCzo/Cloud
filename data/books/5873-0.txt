FAREWELL

FAREWELL



“Come, Deputy of the Centre, come along! We shall have to mend our pace
if we mean to sit down to dinner when every one else does, and that’s
a fact! Hurry up! Jump, Marquis! That’s it! Well done! You are bounding
over the furrows just like a stag!”

These words were uttered by a sportsman seated much at his ease on the
outskirts of the Foret de l’Isle-Adam; he had just finished a Havana
cigar, which he had smoked while he waited for his companion, who
had evidently been straying about for some time among the forest
undergrowth. Four panting dogs by the speaker’s side likewise watched
the progress of the personage for whose benefit the remarks were made.
To make their sarcastic import fully clear, it should be added that the
second sportsman was both short and stout; his ample girth indicated a
truly magisterial corpulence, and in consequence his progress across
the furrows was by no means easy. He was striding over a vast field
of stubble; the dried corn-stalks underfoot added not a little to the
difficulties of his passage, and to add to his discomforts, the genial
influence of the sun that slanted into his eyes brought great drops of
perspiration into his face. The uppermost thought in his mind being a
strong desire to keep his balance, he lurched to and fro like a coach
jolted over an atrocious road.

It was one of those September days of almost tropical heat that finishes
the work of summer and ripens the grapes. Such heat forebodes a coming
storm; and though as yet there were wide patches of blue between the
dark rain-clouds low down on the horizon, pale golden masses were rising
and scattering with ominous swiftness from west to east, and drawing
a shadowy veil across the sky. The wind was still, save in the upper
regions of the air, so that the weight of the atmosphere seemed to
compress the steamy heat of the earth into the forest glades. The tall
forest trees shut out every breath of air so completely that the little
valley across which the sportsman was making his way was as hot as a
furnace; the silent forest seemed parched with the fiery heat. Birds and
insects were mute; the topmost twigs of the trees swayed with scarcely
perceptible motion. Any one who retains some recollection of the summer
of 1819 must surely compassionate the plight of the hapless supporter
of the ministry who toiled and sweated over the stubble to rejoin his
satirical comrade. That gentleman, as he smoked his cigar, had arrived,
by a process of calculation based on the altitude of the sun, to the
conclusion that it must be about five o’clock.

“Where the devil are we?” asked the stout sportsman. He wiped his brow
as he spoke, and propped himself against a tree in the field opposite
his companion, feeling quite unequal to clearing the broad ditch that
lay between them.

“And you ask that question of _me_!” retorted the other, laughing from
his bed of tall brown grasses on the top of the bank. He flung the end
of his cigar into the ditch, exclaiming, “I swear by Saint Hubert that
no one shall catch me risking myself again in a country that I don’t
know with a magistrate, even if, like you, my dear d’Albon, he happens
to be an old schoolfellow.”

“Why, Philip, have you really forgotten your own language? You surely
must have left your wits behind you in Siberia,” said the stouter of the
two, with a glance half-comic, half-pathetic at the guide-post distant
about a hundred paces from them.

“I understand,” replied the one addressed as Philip. He snatched up his
rifle, suddenly sprang to his feet, made but one jump of it into the
field, and rushed off to the guide-post. “This way, d’Albon, here you
are! left about!” he shouted, gesticulating in the direction of the
highroad. “_To Baillet and l’Isle-Adam!_” he went on; “so if we go along
here, we shall be sure to come upon the cross-road to Cassan.”

“Quite right, Colonel,” said M. d’Albon, putting the cap with which he
had been fanning himself back on his head.

“Then _forward_! highly respected Councillor,” returned Colonel Philip,
whistling to the dogs, that seemed already to obey him rather than the
magistrate their owner.

“Are you aware, my lord Marquis, that two leagues yet remain before
us?” inquired the malicious soldier. “That village down yonder must be
Baillet.”

“Great heavens!” cried the Marquis d’Albon. “Go on to Cassan by all
means, if you like; but if you do, you will go alone. I prefer to wait
here, storm or no storm; you can send a horse for me from the chateau.
You have been making game of me, Sucy. We were to have a nice day’s
sport by ourselves; we were not to go very far from Cassan, and go
over ground that I knew. Pooh! instead of a day’s fun, you have kept me
running like a greyhound since four o’clock this morning, and nothing
but a cup or two of milk by way of breakfast. Oh! if ever you find
yourself in a court of law, I will take care that the day goes against
you if you were in the right a hundred times over.”

The dejected sportsman sat himself down on one of the stumps at the
foot of the guide-post, disencumbered himself of his rifle and empty
game-bag, and heaved a prolonged sigh.

“Oh, France, behold thy Deputies!” laughed Colonel de Sucy. “Poor old
d’Albon; if you had spent six months at the other end of Siberia as I
did...”

He broke off, and his eyes sought the sky, as if the story of his
troubles was a secret between himself and God.

“Come, march!” he added. “If you once sit down, it is all over with
you.”

“I can’t help it, Philip! It is such an old habit in a magistrate! I am
dead beat, upon my honor. If I had only bagged one hare though!”

Two men more different are seldom seen together. The civilian, a man
of forty-two, seemed scarcely more than thirty; while the soldier, at
thirty years of age, looked to be forty at the least. Both wore the red
rosette that proclaimed them to be officers of the Legion of Honor. A
few locks of hair, mingled white and black, like a magpie’s wing,
had strayed from beneath the Colonel’s cap; while thick, fair curls
clustered about the magistrate’s temples. The Colonel was tall, spare,
dried up, but muscular; the lines in his pale face told a tale of
vehement passions or of terrible sorrows; but his comrade’s jolly
countenance beamed with health, and would have done credit to an
Epicurean. Both men were deeply sunburnt. Their high gaiters of brown
leather carried souvenirs of every ditch and swamp that they crossed
that day.

“Come, come,” cried M. de Sucy, “forward! One short hour’s march, and we
shall be at Cassan with a good dinner before us.”

“You never were in love, that is positive,” returned the Councillor,
with a comically piteous expression. “You are as inexorable as Article
304 of the Penal Code!”

Philip de Sucy shuddered violently. Deep lines appeared in his broad
forehead, his face was overcast like the sky above them; but though
his features seemed to contract with the pain of an intolerably bitter
memory, no tears came to his eyes. Like all men of strong character, he
possessed the power of forcing his emotions down into some inner depth,
and, perhaps, like many reserved natures, he shrank from laying bare a
wound too deep for any words of human speech, and winced at the thought
of ridicule from those who do not care to understand. M. d’Albon was one
of those who are keenly sensitive by nature to the distress of others,
who feel at once the pain they have unwillingly given by some blunder.
He respected his friend’s mood, rose to his feet, forgot his weariness,
and followed in silence, thoroughly annoyed with himself for having
touched on a wound that seemed not yet healed.

“Some day I will tell you my story,” Philip said at last, wringing
his friend’s hand, while he acknowledged his dumb repentance with a
heart-rending glance. “To-day I cannot.”

They walked on in silence. As the Colonel’s distress passed off the
Councillor’s fatigue returned. Instinctively, or rather urged by
weariness, his eyes explored the depths of the forest around them; he
looked high and low among the trees, and gazed along the avenues, hoping
to discover some dwelling where he might ask for hospitality. They
reached a place where several roads met; and the Councillor, fancying
that he saw a thin film of smoke rising through the trees, made a stand
and looked sharply about him. He caught a glimpse of the dark green
branches of some firs among the other forest trees, and finally, “A
house! a house!” he shouted. No sailor could have raised a cry of “Land
ahead!” more joyfully than he.

He plunged at once into undergrowth, somewhat of the thickest; and the
Colonel, who had fallen into deep musings, followed him unheedingly.

“I would rather have an omelette here and home-made bread, and a chair
to sit down in, than go further for a sofa, truffles, and Bordeaux wine
at Cassan.”

This outburst of enthusiasm on the Councillor’s part was caused by the
sight of the whitened wall of a house in the distance, standing out in
strong contrast against the brown masses of knotted tree-trunks in the
forest.

“Aha! This used to be a priory, I should say,” the Marquis d’Albon cried
once more, as they stood before a grim old gateway. Through the
grating they could see the house itself standing in the midst of some
considerable extent of park land; from the style of the architecture it
appeared to have been a monastery once upon a time.

“Those knowing rascals of monks knew how to choose a site!”

This last exclamation was caused by the magistrate’s amazement at the
romantic hermitage before his eyes. The house had been built on a spot
half-way up the hillside on the slope below the village of Nerville,
which crowned the summit. A huge circle of great oak-trees, hundreds of
years old, guarded the solitary place from intrusion. There appeared
to be about forty acres of the park. The main building of the monastery
faced the south, and stood in a space of green meadow, picturesquely
intersected by several tiny clear streams, and by larger sheets of water
so disposed as to have a natural effect. Shapely trees with contrasting
foliage grew here and there. Grottos had been ingeniously contrived; and
broad terraced walks, now in ruin, though the steps were broken and
the balustrades eaten through with rust, gave to this sylvan Thebaid a
certain character of its own. The art of man and the picturesqueness of
nature had wrought together to produce a charming effect. Human passions
surely could not cross that boundary of tall oak-trees which shut out
the sounds of the outer world, and screened the fierce heat of the sun
from this forest sanctuary.

“What neglect!” said M. d’Albon to himself, after the first sense of
delight in the melancholy aspect of the ruins in the landscape, which
seemed blighted by a curse.

It was like some haunted spot, shunned of men. The twisted ivy stems
clambered everywhere, hiding everything away beneath a luxuriant green
mantle. Moss and lichens, brown and gray, yellow and red, covered the
trees with fantastic patches of color, grew upon the benches in the
garden, overran the roof and the walls of the house. The window-sashes
were weather-worn and warped with age, the balconies were dropping to
pieces, the terraces in ruins. Here and there the folding shutters hung
by a single hinge. The crazy doors would have given way at the first
attempt to force an entrance.

Out in the orchard the neglected fruit-trees were running to wood, the
rambling branches bore no fruit save the glistening mistletoe berries,
and tall plants were growing in the garden walks. All this forlornness
shed a charm across the picture that wrought on the spectator’s mind
with an influence like that of some enchanting poem, filling his
soul with dreamy fancies. A poet must have lingered there in deep and
melancholy musings, marveling at the harmony of this wilderness, where
decay had a certain grace of its own.

In a moment a few gleams of sunlight struggled through a rift in the
clouds, and a shower of colored light fell over the wild garden. The
brown tiles of the roof glowed in the light, the mosses took bright
hues, strange shadows played over the grass beneath the trees; the dead
autumn tints grew vivid, bright unexpected contrasts were evoked by the
light, every leaf stood out sharply in the clear, thin air. Then all
at once the sunlight died away, and the landscape that seemed to have
spoken grew silent and gloomy again, or rather, it took gray soft tones
like the tenderest hues of autumn dusk.

“It is the palace of the Sleeping Beauty,” the Councillor said to
himself (he had already begun to look at the place from the point of
view of an owner of property). “Whom can the place belong to, I wonder.
He must be a great fool not to live on such a charming little estate!”

Just at that moment, a woman sprang out from under a walnut tree on
the right-hand side of the gateway, and passed before the Councillor as
noiselessly and swiftly as the shadow of a cloud. This apparition struck
him dumb with amazement.

“Hallo, d’Albon, what is the matter?” asked the Colonel.

“I am rubbing my eyes to find out whether I am awake or asleep,”
 answered the magistrate, whose countenance was pressed against the
grating in the hope of catching a second glimpse of the ghost.

“In all probability she is under that fig-tree,” he went on, indicating,
for Philip’s benefit, some branches that over-topped the wall on the
left-hand side of the gateway.

“She? Who?”

“Eh! how should I know?” answered M. d’Albon. “A strange-looking woman
sprang up there under my very eyes just now,” he added, in a low voice;
“she looked to me more like a ghost than a living being. She was so
slender, light and shadowy that she might be transparent. Her face was
as white as milk, her hair, her eyes, and her dress were black. She gave
me a glance as she flitted by. I am not easily frightened, but that cold
stony stare of hers froze the blood in my veins.”

“Was she pretty?” inquired Philip.

“I don’t know. I saw nothing but those eyes in her head.”

“The devil take dinner at Cassan!” exclaimed the Colonel; “let us stay
here. I am as eager as a boy to see the inside of this queer place. The
window-sashes are painted red, do you see? There is a red line round
the panels of the doors and the edges of the shutters. It might be the
devil’s own dwelling; perhaps he took it over when the monks went out.
Now, then, let us give chase to the black and white lady; come along!”
 cried Philip, with forced gaiety.

He had scarcely finished speaking when the two sportsmen heard a cry as
if some bird had been taken in a snare. They listened. There was a sound
like the murmur of rippling water, as something forced its way through
the bushes; but diligently as they lent their ears, there was no
footfall on the path, the earth kept the secret of the mysterious
woman’s passage, if indeed she had moved from her hiding-place.

“This is very strange!” cried Philip.

Following the wall of the path, the two friends reached before long
a forest road leading to the village of Chauvry; they went along this
track in the direction of the highway to Paris, and reached another
large gateway. Through the railings they had a complete view of
the facade of the mysterious house. From this point of view, the
dilapidation was still more apparent. Huge cracks had riven the walls
of the main body of the house built round three sides of a square.
Evidently the place was allowed to fall to ruin; there were holes in
the roof, broken slates and tiles lay about below. Fallen fruit from the
orchard trees was left to rot on the ground; a cow was grazing over
the bowling-green and trampling the flowers in the garden beds; a goat
browsed on the green grapes and young vine-shoots on the trellis.

“It is all of a piece,” remarked the Colonel. “The neglect is in a
fashion systematic.” He laid his hand on the chain of the bell-pull, but
the bell had lost its clapper. The two friends heard no sound save the
peculiar grating creak of the rusty spring. A little door in the wall
beside the gateway, though ruinous, held good against all their efforts
to force it open.

“Oho! all this is growing very interesting,” Philip said to his
companion.

“If I were not a magistrate,” returned M. d’Albon, “I should think that
the woman in black is a witch.”

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the cow came up to the
railings and held out her warm damp nose, as if she were glad of human
society. Then a woman, if so indescribable a being could be called a
woman, sprang up from the bushes, and pulled at the cord about the cow’s
neck. From beneath the crimson handkerchief about the woman’s head, fair
matted hair escaped, something as tow hangs about a spindle. She wore
no kerchief at the throat. A coarse black-and-gray striped woolen
petticoat, too short by several inches, left her legs bare. She might
have belonged to some tribe of Redskins in Fenimore Cooper’s novels; for
her neck, arms, and ankles looked as if they had been painted brick-red.
There was no spark of intelligence in her featureless face; her pale,
bluish eyes looked out dull and expressionless from beneath the eyebrows
with one or two straggling white hairs on them. Her teeth were prominent
and uneven, but white as a dog’s.

“Hallo, good woman,” called M. de Sucy.

She came slowly up to the railing, and stared at the two sportsmen with
a contorted smile painful to see.

“Where are we? What is the name of the house yonder? Whom does it belong
to? Who are you? Do you come from hereabouts?”

To these questions, and to a host of others poured out in succession
upon her by the two friends, she made no answer save gurgling sounds
in the throat, more like animal sounds than anything uttered by a human
voice.

“Don’t you see that she is deaf and dumb?” said M. d’Albon.

“_Minorites_!” the peasant woman said at last.

“Ah! she is right. The house looks as though it might once have been a
Minorite convent,” he went on.

Again they plied the peasant woman with questions, but, like a wayward
child, she colored up, fidgeted with her sabot, twisted the rope by
which she held the cow that had fallen to grazing again, stared at the
sportsmen, and scrutinized every article of clothing upon them; she
gibbered, grunted, and clucked, but no articulate word did she utter.

“Your name?” asked Philip, fixing her with his eyes as if he were trying
to bewitch the woman.

“Genevieve,” she answered, with an empty laugh.

“The cow is the most intelligent creature we have seen so far,”
 exclaimed the magistrate. “I shall fire a shot, that ought to bring
somebody out.”

D’Albon had just taken up his rifle when the Colonel put out a hand
to stop him, and pointed out the mysterious woman who had aroused such
lively curiosity in them. She seemed to be absorbed in deep thought, as
she went along a green alley some little distance away, so slowly that
the friends had time to take a good look at her. She wore a threadbare
black satin gown, her long hair curled thickly over her forehead, and
fell like a shawl about her shoulders below her waist. Doubtless she was
accustomed to the dishevelment of her locks, for she seldom put back
the hair on either side of her brows; but when she did so, she shook her
head with a sudden jerk that had not to be repeated to shake away
the thick veil from her eyes or forehead. In everything that she
did, moreover, there was a wonderful certainty in the working of the
mechanism, an unerring swiftness and precision, like that of an animal,
well-nigh marvelous in a woman.

The two sportsmen were amazed to see her spring up into an apple-tree
and cling to a bough lightly as a bird. She snatched at the fruit, ate
it, and dropped to the ground with the same supple grace that charms
us in a squirrel. The elasticity of her limbs took all appearance of
awkwardness or effort from her movements. She played about upon the
grass, rolling in it as a young child might have done; then, on a
sudden, she lay still and stretched out her feet and hands, with the
languid natural grace of a kitten dozing in the sun.

There was a threatening growl of thunder far away, and at this she
started up on all fours and listened, like a dog who hears a strange
footstep. One result of this strange attitude was to separate her thick
black hair into two masses, that fell away on either side of her face
and left her shoulders bare; the two witnesses of this singular scene
wondered at the whiteness of the skin that shone like a meadow daisy,
and at the neck that indicated the perfection of the rest of her form.

A wailing cry broke from her; she rose to her feet, and stood upright.
Every successive movement was made so lightly, so gracefully, so easily,
that she seemed to be no human being, but one of Ossian’s maids of the
mist. She went across the grass to one of the pools of water, deftly
shook off her shoe, and seemed to enjoy dipping her foot, white as
marble, in the spring; doubtless it pleased her to make the circling
ripples, and watch them glitter like gems. She knelt down by the brink,
and played there like a child, dabbling her long tresses in the water,
and flinging them loose again to see the water drip from the ends, like
a string of pearls in the sunless light.

“She is mad!” cried the Councillor.

A hoarse cry rang through the air; it came from Genevieve, and seemed
to be meant for the mysterious woman. She rose to her feet in a moment,
flinging back the hair from her face, and then the Colonel and d’Albon
could see her features distinctly. As soon as she saw the two friends
she bounded to the railings with the swiftness of a fawn.

“_Farewell_!” she said in low, musical tones, but they could not
discover the least trace of feeling, the least idea in the sweet sounds
that they had awaited impatiently.

M. d’Albon admired the long lashes, the thick, dark eyebrows, the
dazzling fairness of skin untinged by any trace of red. Only the
delicate blue veins contrasted with that uniform whiteness.

But when the Marquis turned to communicate his surprise at the sight of
so strange an apparition, he saw the Colonel stretched on the grass like
one dead. M. d’Albon fired his gun into the air, shouted for help, and
tried to raise his friend. At the sound of the shot, the strange lady,
who had stood motionless by the gate, fled away, crying out like a
wounded wild creature, circling round and round in the meadow, with
every sign of unspeakable terror.

M. d’Albon heard a carriage rolling along the road to l’Isle-Adam, and
waved his handkerchief to implore help. The carriage immediately came
towards the Minorite convent, and M. d’Albon recognized neighbors, M.
and Mme. de Grandville, who hastened to alight and put their carriage at
his disposal. Colonel de Sucy inhaled the salts which Mme. de Grandville
happened to have with her; he opened his eyes, looked towards the
mysterious figure that still fled wailing through the meadow, and a
faint cry of horror broke from him; he closed his eyes again, with
a dumb gesture of entreaty to his friends to take him away from this
scene. M. and Mme. de Grandville begged the Councillor to make use of
their carriage, adding very obligingly that they themselves would walk.

“Who can the lady be?” inquired the magistrate, looking towards the
strange figure.

“People think that she comes from Moulins,” answered M. de Grandville.
“She is a Comtesse de Vandieres; she is said to be mad; but as she has
only been here for two months, I cannot vouch for the truth of all this
hearsay talk.”

M. d’Albon thanked M. and Mme. de Grandville, and they set out for
Cassan.

“It is she!” cried Philip, coming to himself.

“She? who?” asked d’Albon.

“Stephanie.... Ah! dead and yet living still; still alive, but her mind
is gone! I thought the sight would kill me.”

The prudent magistrate, recognizing the gravity of the crisis through
which his friend was passing, refrained from asking questions or
exciting him further, and grew impatient of the length of the way to the
chateau, for the change wrought in the Colonel’s face alarmed him. He
feared lest the Countess’ terrible disease had communicated itself to
Philip’s brain. When they reached the avenue at l’Isle-Adam, d’Albon
sent the servant for the local doctor, so that the Colonel had scarcely
been laid in bed before the surgeon was beside him.

“If Monsieur le Colonel had not been fasting, the shock must have killed
him,” pronounced the leech. “He was over-tired, and that saved him,” and
with a few directions as to the patient’s treatment, he went to prepare
a composing draught himself. M. de Sucy was better the next morning, but
the doctor had insisted on sitting up all night with him.

“I confess, Monsieur le Marquis,” the surgeon said, “that I feared for
the brain. M. de Sucy has had some very violent shock; he is a man of
strong passions, but, with his temperament, the first shock decides
everything. He will very likely be out of danger to-morrow.”

The doctor was perfectly right. The next day the patient was allowed to
see his friend.

“I want you to do something for me, dear d’Albon,” Philip said, grasping
his friend’s hand. “Hasten at once to the Minorite convent, find out
everything about the lady whom we saw there, and come back as soon as
you can; I shall count the minutes till I see you again.”

M. d’Albon called for his horse, and galloped over to the old monastery.
When he reached the gateway he found some one standing there, a tall,
spare man with a kindly face, who answered in the affirmative when he
was asked if he lived in the ruined house. M. d’Albon explained his
errand.

“Why, then, it must have been you, sir, who fired that unlucky shot! You
all but killed my poor invalid.”

“Eh! I fired into the air!”

“If you had actually hit Madame la Comtesse, you would have done less
harm to her.”

“Well, well, then, we can neither of us complain, for the sight of the
Countess all but killed my friend, M. de Sucy.”

“The Baron de Sucy, is it possible?” cried the doctor, clasping his
hands. “Has he been in Russia? was he in the Beresina?”

“Yes,” answered d’Albon. “He was taken prisoner by the Cossacks and sent
to Siberia. He has not been back in this country a twelvemonth.”

“Come in, monsieur,” said the other, and he led the way to a
drawing-room on the ground-floor. Everything in the room showed signs of
capricious destruction.

Valuable china jars lay in fragments on either side of a clock beneath a
glass shade, which had escaped. The silk hangings about the windows were
torn to rags, while the muslin curtains were untouched.

“You see about you the havoc wrought by a charming being to whom I
have dedicated my life. She is my niece; and though medical science
is powerless in her case, I hope to restore her to reason, though the
method which I am trying is, unluckily, only possible to the wealthy.”

Then, like all who live much alone and daily bear the burden of a heavy
trouble, he fell to talk with the magistrate. This is the story that he
told, set in order, and with the many digressions made by both teller
and hearer omitted.



When, at nine o’clock at night, on the 28th of November 1812, Marshal
Victor abandoned the heights of Studzianka, which he had held through
the day, he left a thousand men behind with instructions to protect,
till the last possible moment, the two pontoon bridges over the Beresina
that still held good. This rear guard was to save if possible an
appalling number of stragglers, so numbed with the cold, that they
obstinately refused to leave the baggage-wagons. The heroism of the
generous band was doomed to fail; for, unluckily, the men who poured
down to the eastern bank of the Beresina found carriages, caissons, and
all kinds of property which the Army had been forced to abandon during
its passage on the 27th and 28th days of November. The poor, half-frozen
wretches, sunk almost to the level of brutes, finding such unhoped-for
riches, bivouacked in the deserted space, laid hands on the military
stores, improvised huts out of the material, lighted fires with anything
that would burn, cut up the carcasses of the horses for food, tore out
the linings of the carriages, wrapped themselves in them, and lay
down to sleep instead of crossing the Beresina in peace under cover of
night--the Beresina that even then had proved, by incredible fatality,
so disastrous to the Army. Such apathy on the part of the poor fellows
can only be understood by those who remember tramping across those vast
deserts of snow, with nothing to quench their thirst but snow, snow for
their bed, snow as far as the horizon on every side, and no food but
snow, a little frozen beetroot, horseflesh, or a handful of meal.

The miserable creatures were dropping down, overcome by hunger, thirst,
weariness, and sleep, when they reached the shores of the Beresina and
found fuel and fire and victuals, countless wagons and tents, a whole
improvised town, in short. The whole village of Studzianka had been
removed piecemeal from the heights of the plain, and the very perils and
miseries of this dangerous and doleful habitation smiled invitingly to
the wayfarers, who beheld no prospect beyond it but the awful Russian
deserts. A huge hospice, in short, was erected for twenty hours of
existence. Only one thought--the thought of rest--appealed to men weary
of life or rejoicing in unlooked-for comfort.

They lay right in the line of fire from the cannon of the Russian
left; but to that vast mass of human creatures, a patch upon the
snow, sometimes dark, sometimes breaking into flame, the indefatigable
grapeshot was but one discomfort the more. For them it was only a storm,
and they paid the less attention to the bolts that fell among them
because there were none to strike down there save dying men, the
wounded, or perhaps the dead. Stragglers came up in little bands at
every moment. These walking corpses instantly separated, and wandered
begging from fire to fire; and meeting, for the most part, with
refusals, banded themselves together again, and took by force what
they could not otherwise obtain. They were deaf to the voices of their
officers prophesying death on the morrow, and spent the energy required
to cross the swamp in building shelters for the night and preparing a
meal that often proved fatal. The coming death no longer seemed an evil,
for it gave them an hour of slumber before it came. Hunger and thirst
and cold--these were evils, but not death.

At last wood and fuel and canvas and shelters failed, and hideous brawls
began between destitute late comers and the rich already in possession
of a lodging. The weaker were driven away, until a few last fugitives
before the Russian advance were obliged to make their bed in the snow,
and lay down to rise no more.

Little by little the mass of half-dead humanity became so dense, so
deaf, so torpid,--or perhaps it should be said so happy--that Marshal
Victor, their heroic defender against twenty thousand Russians under
Wittgenstein, was actually compelled to cut his way by force through
this forest of men, so as to cross the Beresina with the five thousand
heroes whom he was leading to the Emperor. The miserable creatures
preferred to be trampled and crushed to death rather than stir from
their places, and died without a sound, smiling at the dead ashes of
their fires, forgetful of France.

Not before ten o’clock that night did the Duc de Belluno reach the other
side of the river. Before committing his men to the pontoon bridges that
led to Zembin, he left the fate of the rearguard at Studzianka in Eble’s
hands, and to Eble the survivors of the calamities of the Beresina owed
their lives.

About midnight, the great General, followed by a courageous officer,
came out of his little hut by the bridge, and gazed at the spectacle
of this camp between the bank of the Beresina and the Borizof road to
Studzianka. The thunder of the Russian cannonade had ceased. Here
and there faces that had nothing human about them were lighted up by
countless fires that seemed to grow pale in the glare of the snowfields,
and to give no light. Nearly thirty thousand wretches, belonging to
every nation that Napoleon had hurled upon Russia, lay there hazarding
their lives with the indifference of brute beasts.

“We have all these to save,” the General said to his subordinate.
“To-morrow morning the Russians will be in Studzianka. The moment they
come up we shall have to set fire to the bridge; so pluck up heart,
my boy! Make your way out and up yonder through them, and tell General
Fournier that he has barely time to evacuate his post and cut his way
through to the bridge. As soon as you have seen him set out, follow
him down, take some able-bodied men, and set fire to the tents, wagons,
caissons, carriages, anything and everything, without pity, and drive
these fellows on to the bridge. Compel everything that walks on two legs
to take refuge on the other bank. We must set fire to the camp; it
is our last resource. If Berthier had let me burn those d----d wagons
sooner, no lives need have been lost in the river except my poor
pontooners, my fifty heroes, who saved the Army, and will be forgotten.”

The General passed his hand over his forehead and said no more. He felt
that Poland would be his tomb, and foresaw that afterwards no voice
would be raised to speak for the noble fellows who had plunged into the
stream--into the waters of the Beresina!--to drive in the piles for the
bridges. And, indeed, only one of them is living now, or, to be more
accurate, starving, utterly forgotten in a country village![*] The
brave officer had scarcely gone a hundred paces towards Studzianka, when
General Eble roused some of his patient pontooners, and began his work
of mercy by setting fire to the camp on the side nearest the bridge, so
compelling the sleepers to rise and cross the Beresina. Meanwhile the
young aide-de-camp, not without difficulty, reached the one wooden house
yet left standing in Studzianka.

     [*] This story can be found in _The Country Parson_.--eBook
     preparers.

“So the box is pretty full, is it, messmate?” he said to a man whom he
found outside.

“You will be a knowing fellow if you manage to get inside,” the officer
returned, without turning round or stopping his occupation of hacking at
the woodwork of the house with his sabre.

“Philip, is that you?” cried the aide-de-camp, recognizing the voice of
one of his friends.

“Yes. Aha! is it you, old fellow?” returned M. de Sucy, looking round at
the aide-de-camp, who like himself was not more than twenty-three years
old. “I fancied you were on the other side of this confounded river.
Do you come to bring us sweetmeats for dessert? You will get a warm
welcome,” he added, as he tore away a strip of bark from the wood and
gave it to his horse by way of fodder.

“I am looking for your commandant. General Eble has sent me to tell him
to file off to Zembin. You have only just time to cut your way through
that mass of dead men; as soon as you get through, I am going to set
fire to the place to make them move--”

“You almost make me feel warm! Your news has put me in a fever; I have
two friends to bring through. Ah! but for those marmots, I should have
been dead before now, old fellow. On their account I am taking care
of my horse instead of eating him. But have you a crust about you, for
pity’s sake? It is thirty hours since I have stowed any victuals. I have
been fighting like a madman to keep up a little warmth in my body and
what courage I have left.”

“Poor Philip! I have nothing--not a scrap!--But is your General in
there?”

“Don’t attempt to go in. The barn is full of our wounded. Go up a bit
higher, and you will see a sort of pig-sty to the right--that is where
the General is. Good-bye, my dear fellow. If ever we meet again in a
quadrille in a ballroom in Paris--”

He did not finish the sentence, for the treachery of the northeast wind
that whistled about them froze Major Philip’s lips, and the aide-de-camp
kept moving for fear of being frost-bitten. Silence soon prevailed,
scarcely broken by the groans of the wounded in the barn, or the stifled
sounds made by M. de Sucy’s horse crunching on the frozen bark with
famished eagerness. Philip thrust his sabre into the sheath, caught at
the bridle of the precious animal that he had managed to keep for so
long, and drew her away from the miserable fodder that she was bolting
with apparent relish.

“Come along, Bichette! come along! It lies with you now, my beauty, to
save Stephanie’s life. There, wait a little longer, and they will let us
lie down and die, no doubt;” and Philip, wrapped in a pelisse, to which
doubtless he owed his life and energies, began to run, stamping his feet
on the frozen snow to keep them warm. He was scarce five hundred paces
away before he saw a great fire blazing on the spot where he had left
his carriage that morning with an old soldier to guard it. A dreadful
misgiving seized upon him. Many a man under the influence of a powerful
feeling during the Retreat summoned up energy for his friend’s sake when
he would not have exerted himself to save his own life; so it was with
Philip. He soon neared a hollow, where he had left a carriage sheltered
from the cannonade, a carriage that held a young woman, his playmate in
childhood, dearer to him than any one else on earth.

Some thirty stragglers were sitting round a tremendous blaze, which
they kept up with logs of wood, planks wrenched from the floors of the
caissons, and wheels, and panels from carriage bodies. These had been,
doubtless, among the last to join the sea of fires, huts, and human
faces that filled the great furrow in the land between Studzianka and
the fatal river, a restless living sea of almost imperceptibly moving
figures, that sent up a smothered hum of sound blended with frightful
shrieks. It seemed that hunger and despair had driven these forlorn
creatures to take forcible possession of the carriage, for the old
General and his young wife, whom they had found warmly wrapped in
pelisses and traveling cloaks, were now crouching on the earth beside
the fire, and one of the carriage doors was broken.

As soon as the group of stragglers round the fire heard the footfall
of the Major’s horse, a frenzied yell of hunger went up from them. “A
horse!” they cried. “A horse!”

All the voices went up as one voice.

“Back! back! Look out!” shouted two or three of them, leveling their
muskets at the animal.

“I will pitch you neck and crop into your fire, you blackguards!” cried
Philip, springing in front of the mare. “There are dead horses lying up
yonder; go and look for them!”

“What a rum customer the officer is!--Once, twice, will you get out of
the way?” returned a giant grenadier. “You won’t? All right then, just
as you please.”

A woman’s shriek rang out above the report. Luckily, none of the bullets
hit Philip; but poor Bichette lay in the agony of death. Three of the
men came up and put an end to her with thrusts of the bayonet.

“Cannibals! leave me the rug and my pistols,” cried Philip in
desperation.

“Oh! the pistols if you like; but as for the rug, there is a fellow
yonder who has had nothing to wet his whistle these two days, and is
shivering in his coat of cobwebs, and that’s our General.”

Philips looked up and saw a man with worn-out shoes and a dozen rents in
his trousers; the only covering for his head was a ragged foraging
cap, white with rime. He said no more after that, but snatched up his
pistols.

Five of the men dragged the mare to the fire, and began to cut up the
carcass as dexterously as any journeymen butchers in Paris. The scraps
of meat were distributed and flung upon the coals, and the whole process
was magically swift. Philip went over to the woman who had given the cry
of terror when she recognized his danger, and sat down by her side. She
sat motionless upon a cushion taken from the carriage, warming herself
at the blaze; she said no word, and gazed at him without a smile. He
saw beside her the soldier whom he had left mounting guard over the
carriage; the poor fellow had been wounded; he had been overpowered by
numbers, and forced to surrender to the stragglers who had set upon him,
and, like a dog who defends his master’s dinner till the last moment,
he had taken his share of the spoil, and had made a sort of cloak for
himself out of a sheet. At that particular moment he was busy toasting
a piece of horseflesh, and in his face the major saw a gleeful
anticipation of the coming feast.

The Comte de Vandieres, who seemed to have grown quite childish in the
last few days, sat on a cushion close to his wife, and stared into
the fire. He was only just beginning to shake off his torpor under
the influence of the warmth. He had been no more affected by Philip’s
arrival and danger than by the fight and subsequent pillaging of his
traveling carriage.

At first Sucy caught the young Countess’ hand in his, trying to express
his affection for her, and the pain that it gave him to see her reduced
like this to the last extremity of misery; but he said nothing as he
sat by her side on the thawing heap of snow, he gave himself up to the
pleasure of the sensation of warmth, forgetful of danger, forgetful of
all things else in the world. In spite of himself his face expanded with
an almost fatuous expression of satisfaction, and he waited impatiently
till the scrap of horseflesh that had fallen to his soldier’s share
should be cooked. The smell of charred flesh stimulated his hunger.
Hunger clamored within and silenced his heart, his courage, and his
love. He coolly looked round on the results of the spoliation of his
carriage. Not a man seated round the fire but had shared the booty, the
rugs, cushions, pelisses, dresses,--articles of clothing that belonged
to the Count and Countess or to himself. Philip turned to see if
anything worth taking was left in the berline. He saw by the light of
the flames, gold, and diamonds, and silver lying scattered about; no one
had cared to appropriate the least particle. There was something hideous
in the silence among those human creatures round the fire; none of them
spoke, none of them stirred, save to do such things as each considered
necessary for his own comfort.

It was a grotesque misery. The men’s faces were wrapped and disfigured
with the cold, and plastered over with a layer of mud; you could see
the thickness of the mask by the channel traced down their cheeks by
the tears that ran from their eyes, and their long slovenly-kept beards
added to the hideousness of their appearance. Some were wrapped round in
women’s shawls, others in horse-cloths, dirty blankets, rags stiffened
with melting hoar-frost; here and there a man wore a boot on one foot
and a shoe on the other, in fact, there was not one of them but wore
some ludicrously odd costume. But the men themselves with such matter
for jest about them were gloomy and taciturn.

The silence was unbroken save by the crackling of the wood, the roaring
of the flames, the far-off hum of the camp, and the sound of sabres
hacking at the carcass of the mare. Some of the hungriest of the men
were still cutting tidbits for themselves. A few miserable creatures,
more weary than the others, slept outright; and if they happened to roll
into the fire, no one pulled them back. With cut-and-dried logic their
fellows argued that if they were not dead, a scorching ought to be
sufficient warning to quit and seek out more comfortable quarters. If
the poor wretch woke to find himself on fire, he was burned to death,
and nobody pitied him. Here and there the men exchanged glances, as if
to excuse their indifference by the carelessness of the rest; the thing
happened twice under the Countess’ eyes, and she uttered no sound. When
all the scraps of horseflesh had been broiled upon the coals, they were
devoured with a ravenous greediness that would have been disgusting in
wild beasts.

“And now we have seen thirty infantrymen on one horse for the first
time in our lives!” cried the grenadier who had shot the mare, the one
solitary joke that sustained the Frenchmen’s reputation for wit.

Before long the poor fellows huddled themselves up in their clothes,
and lay down on planks of timber, on anything but the bare snow, and
slept--heedless of the morrow. Major de Sucy having warmed himself and
satisfied his hunger, fought in vain against the drowsiness that weighed
upon his eyes. During this brief struggle he gazed at the sleeping girl
who had turned her face to the fire, so that he could see her closed
eyelids and part of her forehead. She was wrapped round in a furred
pelisse and a coarse horseman’s cloak, her head lay on a blood-stained
cushion; a tall astrakhan cap tied over her head by a handkerchief
knotted under the chin protected her face as much as possible from the
cold, and she had tucked up her feet in the cloak. As she lay curled up
in this fashion, she bore no likeness to any creature.

Was this the lowest of camp-followers? Was this the charming woman, the
pride of her lover’s heart, the queen of many a Parisian ballroom? Alas!
even for the eyes of this most devoted friend, there was no discernible
trace of womanhood in that bundle of rags and linen, and the cold was
mightier than the love in a woman’s heart.

Then for the major the husband and wife came to be like two distant dots
seen through the thick veil that the most irresistible kind of slumber
spread over his eyes. It all seemed to be part of a dream--the leaping
flames, the recumbent figures, the awful cold that lay in wait for them
three paces away from the warmth of the fire that glowed for a little
while. One thought that could not be stifled haunted Philip--“If I go to
sleep, we shall all die; I will not sleep,” he said to himself.

He slept. After an hour’s slumber M. de Sucy was awakened by a hideous
uproar and the sound of an explosion. The remembrance of his duty, of
the danger of his beloved, rushed upon his mind with a sudden shock. He
uttered a cry like the growl of a wild beast. He and his servant stood
upright above the rest. They saw a sea of fire in the darkness, and
against it moving masses of human figures. Flames were devouring the
huts and tents. Despairing shrieks and yelling cries reached their
ears; they saw thousands upon thousands of wild and desperate faces;
and through this inferno a column of soldiers was cutting its way to the
bridge, between the two hedges of dead bodies.

“Our rearguard is in full retreat,” cried the major. “There is no hope
left!”

“I have spared your traveling carriage, Philip,” said a friendly voice.

Sucy turned and saw the young aide-de-camp by the light of the flames.

“Oh, it is all over with us,” he answered. “They have eaten my horse.
And how am I to make this sleepy general and his wife stir a step?”

“Take a brand, Philip, and threaten them.”

“Threaten the Countess?...”

“Good-bye,” cried the aide-de-camp; “I have only just time to get across
that unlucky river, and go I must, there is my mother in France!... What
a night! This herd of wretches would rather lie here in the snow, and
most of them would sooner be burned alive than get up.... It is four
o’clock, Philip! In two hours the Russians will begin to move, and you
will see the Beresina covered with corpses a second time, I can tell
you. You haven’t a horse, and you cannot carry the Countess, so come
along with me,” he went on, taking his friend by the arm.

“My dear fellow, how am I to leave Stephanie?”

Major de Sucy grasped the Countess, set her on her feet, and shook her
roughly; he was in despair. He compelled her to wake, and she stared at
him with dull fixed eyes.

“Stephanie, we must go, or we shall die here!”

For all answer, the Countess tried to sink down again and sleep on the
earth. The aide-de-camp snatched a brand from the fire and shook it in
her face.

“We must save her in spite of herself,” cried Philip, and he carried her
in his arms to the carriage. He came back to entreat his friend to help
him, and the two young men took the old general and put him beside his
wife, without knowing whether he were alive or dead. The major rolled
the men over as they crouched on the earth, took away the plundered
clothing, and heaped it upon the husband and wife, then he flung some of
the broiled fragments of horseflesh into a corner of the carriage.

“Now, what do you mean to do?” asked the aide-de-camp.

“Drag them along!” answered Sucy.

“You are mad!”

“You are right!” exclaimed Philip, folding his arms on his breast.

Suddenly a desperate plan occurred to him.

“Look you here!” he said, grasping his sentinel by the unwounded arm.
“I leave her in your care for one hour. Bear in mind that you must die
sooner than let any one, no matter whom, come near the carriage!”

The major seized a handful of the lady’s diamonds, drew his sabre, and
violently battered those who seemed to him to be the bravest among the
sleepers. By this means he succeeded in rousing the gigantic grenadier
and a couple of men whose rank and regiment were undiscoverable.

“It is all up with us!” he cried.

“Of course it is,” returned the grenadier; “but that is all one to me.”

“Very well then, if die you must, isn’t it better to sell your life for
a pretty woman, and stand a chance of going back to France again?”

“I would rather go to sleep,” said one of the men, dropping down
into the snow; “and if you worry me again, major, I shall stick my
toasting-iron into your body.”

“What is it all about, sir?” asked the grenadier. “The man’s drunk. He
is a Parisian, and likes to lie in the lap of luxury.”

“You shall have these, good fellow,” said the major, holding out a
riviere of diamonds, “if you will follow me and fight like a madman. The
Russians are not ten minutes away; they have horses; we will march up to
the nearest battery and carry off two stout ones.”

“How about the sentinels, major?”

“One of us three--” he began; then he turned from the soldier and looked
at the aide-de-camp.--“You are coming, aren’t you, Hippolyte?”

Hippolyte nodded assent.

“One of us,” the major went on, “will look after the sentry. Besides,
perhaps those blessed Russians are also fast asleep.”

“All right, major; you are a good sort! But will you take me in your
carriage?” asked the grenadier.

“Yes, if you don’t leave your bones up yonder.--If I come to grief,
promise me, you two, that you will do everything in your power to save
the Countess.”

“All right,” said the grenadier.

They set out for the Russian lines, taking the direction of the
batteries that had so cruelly raked the mass of miserable creatures
huddled together by the river bank. A few minutes later the hoofs of two
galloping horses rang on the frozen snow, and the awakened battery fired
a volley that passed over the heads of the sleepers; the hoof-beats
rattled so fast on the iron ground that they sounded like the hammering
in a smithy. The generous aide-de-camp had fallen; the stalwart
grenadier had come off safe and sound; and Philip himself received
a bayonet thrust in the shoulder while defending his friend.
Notwithstanding his wound, he clung to his horse’s mane, and gripped him
with his knees so tightly that the animal was held as in a vise.

“God be praised!” cried the major, when he saw his soldier still on the
spot, and the carriage standing where he had left it.

“If you do the right thing by me, sir, you will get me the cross for
this. We have treated them to a sword dance to a pretty tune from the
rifle, eh?”

“We have done nothing yet! Let us put the horses in. Take hold of these
cords.”

“They are not long enough.”

“All right, grenadier, just go and overhaul those fellows sleeping
there; take their shawls, sheets, anything--”

“I say! the rascal is dead,” cried the grenadier, as he plundered the
first man who came to hand. “Why, they are all dead! how queer!”

“All of them?”

“Yes, every one. It looks as though the horseflesh _a la neige_ was
indigestible.”

Philip shuddered at the words. The night had grown twice as cold as
before.

“Great heaven! to lose her when I have saved her life a score of times
already.”

He shook the Countess, “Stephanie! Stephanie!” he cried.

She opened her eyes.

“We are saved, madame!”

“Saved!” she echoed, and fell back again.

The horses were harnessed after a fashion at last. The major held his
sabre in his unwounded hand, took the reins in the other, saw to his
pistols, and sprang on one of the horses, while the grenadier mounted
the other. The old sentinel had been pushed into the carriage, and lay
across the knees of the general and the Countess; his feet were frozen.
Urged on by blows from the flat of the sabre, the horses dragged the
carriage at a mad gallop down to the plain, where endless difficulties
awaited them. Before long it became almost impossible to advance without
crushing sleeping men, women, and even children at every step, all of
whom declined to stir when the grenadier awakened them. In vain M. de
Sucy looked for the track that the rearguard had cut through this dense
crowd of human beings; there was no more sign of their passage than the
wake of a ship in the sea. The horses could only move at a foot-pace,
and were stopped most frequently by soldiers, who threatened to kill
them.

“Do you mean to get there?” asked the grenadier.

“Yes, if it costs every drop of blood in my body! if it costs the whole
world!” the major answered.

“Forward, then!... You can’t have the omelette without breaking eggs.”
 And the grenadier of the Garde urged on the horses over the prostrate
bodies, and upset the bivouacs; the blood-stained wheels ploughing that
field of faces left a double furrow of dead. But in justice it should be
said that he never ceased to thunder out his warning cry, “Carrion! look
out!”

“Poor wretches!” exclaimed the major.

“Bah! That way, or the cold, or the cannon!” said the grenadier, goading
on the horses with the point of his sword.

Then came the catastrophe, which must have happened sooner but for
miraculous good fortune; the carriage was overturned, and all further
progress was stopped at once.

“I expected as much!” exclaimed the imperturbable grenadier. “Oho! he is
dead!” he added, looking at his comrade.

“Poor Laurent!” said the major.

“Laurent! Wasn’t he in the Fifth Chasseurs?”

“Yes.”

“My own cousin.--Pshaw! this beastly life is not so pleasant that one
need be sorry for him as things go.”

But all this time the carriage lay overturned, and the horses were only
released after great and irreparable loss of time. The shock had been
so violent that the Countess had been awakened by it, and the subsequent
commotion aroused her from her stupor. She shook off the rugs and rose.

“Where are we, Philip?” she asked in musical tones, as she looked about
her.

“About five hundred paces from the bridge. We are just about to cross
the Beresina. When we are on the other side, Stephanie, I will not tease
you any more; I will let you go to sleep; we shall be in safety, we can
go on to Wilna in peace. God grant that you may never know what your
life has cost!”

“You are wounded!”

“A mere trifle.”

The hour of doom had come. The Russian cannon announced the day. The
Russians were in possession of Studzianka, and thence were raking the
plain with grapeshot; and by the first dim light of the dawn the major
saw two columns moving and forming above the heights. Then a cry of
horror went up from the crowd, and in a moment every one sprang to his
feet. Each instinctively felt his danger, and all made a rush for the
bridge, surging towards it like a wave.

Then the Russians came down upon them, swift as a conflagration. Men,
women, children, and horses all crowded towards the river. Luckily for
the major and the Countess, they were still at some distance from the
bank. General Eble had just set fire to the bridge on the other side;
but in spite of all the warnings given to those who rushed towards the
chance of salvation, not one among them could or would draw back. The
overladen bridge gave way, and not only so, the impetus of the frantic
living wave towards that fatal bank was such that a dense crowd of human
beings was thrust into the water as if by an avalanche. The sound of a
single human cry could not be distinguished; there was a dull crash as
if an enormous stone had fallen into the water--and the Beresina was
covered with corpses.

The violent recoil of those in front, striving to escape this death,
brought them into hideous collision with those behind then, who were
pressing towards the bank, and many were suffocated and crushed. The
Comte and Comtesse de Vandieres owed their lives to the carriage. The
horses that had trampled and crushed so many dying men were crushed and
trampled to death in their turn by the human maelstrom which eddied from
the bank. Sheer physical strength saved the major and the grenadier.
They killed others in self-defence. That wild sea of human faces and
living bodies, surging to and fro as by one impulse, left the bank
of the Beresina clear for a few moments. The multitude had hurled
themselves back on the plain. Some few men sprang down from the banks
of the river, not so much with any hope of reaching the opposite shore,
which for them meant France, as from dread of the wastes of Siberia.
For some bold spirits despair became a panoply. An officer leaped from
hummock to hummock of ice, and reached the other shore; one of the
soldiers scrambled over miraculously on the piles of dead bodies and
drift ice. But the immense multitude left behind saw at last that the
Russians would not slaughter twenty thousand unarmed men, too numb
with the cold to attempt to resist them, and each awaited his fate
with dreadful apathy. By this time the major and his grenadier, the
old general and his wife, were left to themselves not very far from
the place where the bridge had been. All four stood dry-eyed and silent
among the heaps of dead. A few able-bodied men and one or two officers,
who had recovered all their energy at this crisis, gathered about them.
The group was sufficiently large; there were about fifty men all told.
A couple of hundred paces from them stood the wreck of the artillery
bridge, which had broken down the day before; the major saw this, and
“Let us make a raft!” he cried.

The words were scarcely out of his mouth before the whole group hurried
to the ruins of the bridge. A crowd of men began to pick up iron clamps
and to hunt for planks and ropes--for all the materials for a raft, in
short. A score of armed men and officers, under command of the major,
stood on guard to protect the workers from any desperate attempt on the
part of the multitude if they should guess their design. The longing for
freedom, which inspires prisoners to accomplish impossibilities, cannot
be compared with the hope which lent energy at that moment to these
forlorn Frenchmen.

“The Russians are upon us! Here are the Russians!” the guard shouted to
the workers.

The timbers creaked, the raft grew larger, stronger, and more
substantial. Generals, colonels, and common soldiers all alike bent
beneath the weight of wagon-wheels, chains, coils of rope, and planks of
timber; it was a modern realization of the building of Noah’s ark. The
young Countess, sitting by her husband’s side, looked on, regretful that
she could do nothing to aide the workers, though she helped to knot the
lengths of rope together.

At last the raft was finished. Forty men launched it out into the river,
while ten of the soldiers held the ropes that must keep it moored to
the shore. The moment that they saw their handiwork floating on
the Beresina, they sprang down onto it from the bank with callous
selfishness. The major, dreading the frenzy of the first rush, held back
Stephanie and the general; but a shudder ran through him when he saw the
landing place black with people, and men crowding down like playgoers
into the pit of a theatre.

“It was I who thought of the raft, you savages!” he cried. “I have saved
your lives, and you will not make room for me!”

A confused murmur was the only answer. The men at the edge took up stout
poles, trust them against the bank with all their might, so as to shove
the raft out and gain an impetus at its starting upon a journey across a
sea of floating ice and dead bodies towards the other shore.

“_Tonnerre de Dieu_! I will knock some of you off into the water if
you don’t make room for the major and his two companions,” shouted the
grenadier. He raised his sabre threateningly, delayed the departure, and
made the men stand closer together, in spite of threatening yells.

“I shall fall in!... I shall go overboard!...” his fellows shouted.

“Let us start! Put off!”

The major gazed with tearless eyes at the woman he loved; an impulse of
sublime resignation raised her eyes to heaven.

“To die with you!” she said.

In the situation of the folk upon the raft there was a certain comic
element. They might utter hideous yells, but not one of them dared to
oppose the grenadier, for they were packed together so tightly that
if one man were knocked down, the whole raft might capsize. At this
delicate crisis, a captain tried to rid himself of one of his neighbors;
the man saw the hostile intention of his officer, collared him, and
pitched him overboard. “Aha! The duck has a mind to drink. ... Over with
you!--There is room for two now!” he shouted. “Quick, major! throw your
little woman over, and come! Never mind that old dotard! he will drop
off to-morrow!”

“Be quick!” cried a voice, made up of a hundred voices.

“Come, major! Those fellows are making a fuss, and well they may.”

The Comte de Vandieres flung off his ragged blankets, and stood before
them in his general’s uniform.

“Let us save the Count,” said Philip.

Stephanie grasped his hand tightly in hers, flung her arms about, and
clasped him close in an agonized embrace.

“Farewell!” she said.

Then each knew the other’s thoughts. The Comte de Vandieres recovered
his energies and presence of mind sufficiently to jump on to the raft,
whither Stephanie followed him after one last look at Philip.

“Major, won’t you take my place? I do not care a straw for life; I have
neither a wife, nor child, nor mother belonging to me--”

“I give them into your charge,” cried the major, indicating the Count
and his wife.

“Be easy; I will take as much care of them as of the apple of my eye.”

Philip stood stock-still on the bank. The raft sped so violently towards
the opposite shore that it ran aground with a violent shock to all on
board. The Count, standing on the very edge, was shaken into the stream;
and as he fell, a mass of ice swept by and struck off his head, and sent
it flying like a ball.

“Hey! major!” shouted the grenadier.

“Farewell!” a woman’s voice called aloud.

An icy shiver ran through Philip de Sucy, and he dropped down where he
stood, overcome with cold and sorrow and weariness.



“My poor niece went out of her mind,” the doctor added after a brief
pause. “Ah! monsieur,” he went on, grasping M. d’Albon’s hand, “what
a fearful life for a poor little thing, so young, so delicate! An
unheard-of misfortune separated her from that grenadier of the Garde
(Fleuriot by name), and for two years she was dragged on after the army,
the laughing-stock of a rabble of outcasts. She went barefoot, I
heard, ill-clad, neglected, and starved for months at a time; sometimes
confined to a hospital, sometimes living like a hunted animal. God alone
knows all the misery which she endured, and yet she lives. She was shut
up in a madhouse in a little German town, while her relations, believing
her to be dead, were dividing her property here in France.

“In 1816 the grenadier Fleuriot recognized her in an inn in Strasbourg.
She had just managed to escape from captivity. Some peasants told him
that the Countess had lived for a whole month in a forest, and how that
they had tracked her and tried to catch her without success.

“I was at that time not many leagues from Strasbourg; and hearing the
talk about the girl in the wood, I wished to verify the strange facts
that had given rise to absurd stories. What was my feeling when I beheld
the Countess? Fleuriot told me all that he knew of the piteous story.
I took the poor fellow with my niece into Auvergne, and there I had the
misfortune to lose him. He had some ascendancy over Mme. de Vandieres.
He alone succeeded in persuading her to wear clothes; and in those days
her one word of human speech--_Farewell_--she seldom uttered. Fleuriot
set himself to the task of awakening certain associations; but there
he failed completely; he drew that one sorrowful word from her a little
more frequently, that was all. But the old grenadier could amuse her,
and devoted himself to playing with her, and through him I hoped; but--”
 here Stephanie’s uncle broke off. After a moment he went on again.

“Here she has found another creature with whom she seems to have
an understanding--an idiot peasant girl, who once, in spite of her
plainness and imbecility, fell in love with a mason. The mason thought
of marrying her because she had a little bit of land, and for a whole
year poor Genevieve was the happiest of living creatures. She dressed in
her best, and danced on Sundays with Dallot; she understood love; there
was room for love in her heart and brain. But Dallot thought better of
it. He found another girl who had all her senses and rather more land
than Genevieve, and he forsook Genevieve for her. Then the poor thing
lost the little intelligence that love had developed in her; she can do
nothing now but cut grass and look after the cattle. My niece and the
poor girl are in some sort bound to each other by the invisible chain of
their common destiny, and by their madness due to the same cause. Just
come here a moment; look!” and Stephanie’s uncle led the Marquis d’Albon
to the window.

There, in fact, the magistrate beheld the pretty Countess sitting on the
ground at Genevieve’s knee, while the peasant girl was wholly absorbed
in combing out Stephanie’s long, black hair with a huge comb. The
Countess submitted herself to this, uttering low smothered cries that
expressed her enjoyment of the sensation of physical comfort. A shudder
ran through M. d’Albon as he saw her attitude of languid abandonment,
the animal supineness that revealed an utter lack of intelligence.

“Oh! Philip, Philip!” he cried, “past troubles are as nothing. Is it
quite hopeless?” he asked.

The doctor raised his eyes to heaven.

“Good-bye, monsieur,” said M. d’Albon, pressing the old man’s hand. “My
friend is expecting me; you will see him here before long.”



“Then it is Stephanie herself?” cried Sucy when the Marquis had spoken
the first few words. “Ah! until now I did not feel sure!” he added.
Tears filled the dark eyes that were wont to wear a stern expression.

“Yes; she is the Comtesse de Vandieres,” his friend replied.

The colonel started up, and hurriedly began to dress.

“Why, Philip!” cried the horrified magistrate. “Are you going mad?”

“I am quite well now,” said the colonel simply. “This news has soothed
all my bitterest grief; what pain could hurt me while I think of
Stephanie? I am going over to the Minorite convent, to see her and speak
to her, to restore her to health again. She is free; ah, surely, surely,
happiness will smile on us, or there is no Providence above. How can
you think she could hear my voice, poor Stephanie, and not recover her
reason?”

“She has seen you once already, and she did not recognize you,” the
magistrate answered gently, trying to suggest some wholesome fears to
this friend, whose hopes were visibly too high.

The colonel shuddered, but he began to smile again, with a slight
involuntary gesture of incredulity. Nobody ventured to oppose his plans,
and a few hours later he had taken up his abode in the old priory, to be
near the doctor and the Comtesse de Vandieres.

“Where is she?” he cried at once.

“Hush!” answered M. Fanjat, Stephanie’s uncle. “She is sleeping. Stay;
here she is.”

Philip saw the poor distraught sleeper crouching on a stone bench in
the sun. Her thick hair, straggling over her face, screened it from the
glare and heat; her arms dropped languidly to the earth; she lay at ease
as gracefully as a fawn, her feet tucked up beneath her; her bosom
rose and fell with her even breathing; there was the same transparent
whiteness as of porcelain in her skin and complexion that we so often
admire in children’s faces. Genevieve sat there motionless, holding a
spray that Stephanie doubtless had brought down from the top of one of
the tallest poplars; the idiot girl was waving the green branch above
her, driving away the flies from her sleeping companion, and gently
fanning her.

She stared at M. Fanjat and the colonel as they came up; then, like
a dumb animal that recognizes its master, she slowly turned her face
towards the countess, and watched over her as before, showing not
the slightest sign of intelligence or of astonishment. The air was
scorching. The glittering particles of the stone bench shone like sparks
of fire; the meadow sent up the quivering vapors that hover above
the grass and gleam like golden dust when they catch the light, but
Genevieve did not seem to feel the raging heat.

The colonel wrung M. Fanjat’s hands; the tears that gathered in
the soldier’s eyes stole down his cheeks, and fell on the grass at
Stephanie’s feet.

“Sir,” said her uncle, “for these two years my heart has been broken
daily. Before very long you will be as I am; if you do not weep, you
will not feel your anguish the less.”

“You have taken care of her!” said the colonel, and jealousy no less
than gratitude could be read in his eyes.

The two men understood one another. They grasped each other by the hand
again, and stood motionless, gazing in admiration at the serenity that
slumber had brought into the lovely face before them. Stephanie heaved
a sigh from time to time, and this sigh, that had all the appearance of
sensibility, made the unhappy colonel tremble with gladness.

“Alas!” M. Fanjat said gently, “do not deceive yourself, monsieur; as
you see her now, she is in full possession of such reason as she has.”

Those who have sat for whole hours absorbed in the delight of watching
over the slumber of some tenderly-beloved one, whose waking eyes will
smile for them, will doubtless understand the bliss and anguish that
shook the colonel. For him this slumber was an illusion, the waking must
be a kind of death, the most dreadful of all deaths.

Suddenly a kid frisked in two or three bounds towards the bench and
snuffed at Stephanie. The sound awakened her; she sprang lightly to her
feet without scaring away the capricious creature; but as soon as she
saw Philip she fled, followed by her four-footed playmate, to a thicket
of elder-trees; then she uttered a little cry like the note of a
startled wild bird, the same sound that the colonel had heard once
before near the grating, when the Countess appeared to M. d’Albon for
the first time. At length she climbed into a laburnum-tree, ensconced
herself in the feathery greenery, and peered out at the _strange man_
with as much interest as the most inquisitive nightingale in the forest.

“Farewell, farewell, farewell,” she said, but the soul sent no trace
of expression of feeling through the words, spoken with the careless
intonation of a bird’s notes.

“She does not know me!” the colonel exclaimed in despair. “Stephanie!
Here is Philip, your Philip!... Philip!” and the poor soldier went
towards the laburnum-tree; but when he stood three paces away, the
Countess eyed him almost defiantly, though there was timidity in her
eyes; then at a bound she sprang from the laburnum to an acacia, and
thence to a spruce-fir, swinging from bough to bough with marvelous
dexterity.

“Do not follow her,” said M. Fanjat, addressing the colonel. “You would
arouse a feeling of aversion in her which might become insurmountable; I
will help you to make her acquaintance and to tame her. Sit down on the
bench. If you pay no heed whatever to her, poor child, it will not be
long before you will see her come nearer by degrees to look at you.”

“That _she_ should not know me; that she should fly from me!” the
colonel repeated, sitting down on a rustic bench and leaning his back
against a tree that overshadowed it.

He bowed his head. The doctor remained silent. Before very long the
Countess stole softly down from her high refuge in the spruce-fir,
flitting like a will-o’-the-wisp; for as the wind stirred the boughs,
she lent herself at times to the swaying movements of the trees. At
each branch she stopped and peered at the stranger; but as she saw him
sitting motionless, she at length jumped down to the grass, stood a
while, and came slowly across the meadow. When she took up her position
by a tree about ten paces from the bench, M. Fanjat spoke to the colonel
in a low voice.

“Feel in my pocket for some lumps of sugar,” he said, “and let her see
them, she will come; I willingly give up to you the pleasure of giving
her sweetmeats. She is passionately fond of sugar, and by that means you
will accustom her to come to you and to know you.”

“She never cared for sweet things when she was a woman,” Philip answered
sadly.

When he held out the lump of sugar between his thumb and finger, and
shook it, Stephanie uttered the wild note again, and sprang quickly
towards him; then she stopped short, there was a conflict between
longing for the sweet morsel and instinctive fear of him; she looked at
the sugar, turned her head away, and looked again like an unfortunate
dog forbidden to touch some scrap of food, while his master slowly
recites the greater part of the alphabet until he reaches the letter
that gives permission. At length the animal appetite conquered fear;
Stephanie rushed to Philip, held out a dainty brown hand to pounce upon
the coveted morsel, touched her lover’s fingers, snatched the piece of
sugar, and vanished with it into a thicket. This painful scene was
too much for the colonel; he burst into tears, and took refuge in the
drawing-room.

“Then has love less courage than affection?” M. Fanjat asked him. “I
have hope, Monsieur le Baron. My poor niece was once in a far more
pitiable state than at present.”

“Is it possible?” cried Philip.

“She would not wear clothes,” answered the doctor.

The colonel shuddered, and his face grew pale. To the doctor’s mind this
pallor was an unhealthy symptom; he went over to him and felt his pulse.
M. de Sucy was in a high fever; by dint of persuasion, he succeeded in
putting the patient in bed, and gave him a few drops of laudanum to gain
repose and sleep.

The Baron de Sucy spent nearly a week, in a constant struggle with a
deadly anguish, and before long he had no tears left to shed. He was
often well-nigh heartbroken; he could not grow accustomed to the sight
of the Countess’ madness; but he made terms for himself, as it were, in
this cruel position, and sought alleviations in his pain. His heroism
was boundless. He found courage to overcome Stephanie’s wild shyness
by choosing sweetmeats for her, and devoted all his thoughts to this,
bringing these dainties, and following up the little victories that
he set himself to gain over Stephanie’s instincts (the last gleam
of intelligence in her), until he succeeded to some extent--she grew
_tamer_ than ever before. Every morning the colonel went into the park;
and if, after a long search for the Countess, he could not discover the
tree in which she was rocking herself gently, nor the nook where she
lay crouching at play with some bird, nor the roof where she had perched
herself, he would whistle the well-known air _Partant pour la Syrie_,
which recalled old memories of their love, and Stephanie would run
towards him lightly as a fawn. She saw the colonel so often that she was
no longer afraid of him; before very long she would sit on his knee with
her thin, lithe arms about him. And while thus they sat as lovers love
to do, Philip doled out sweetmeats one by one to the eager Countess.
When they were all finished, the fancy often took Stephanie to search
through her lover’s pockets with a monkey’s quick instinctive dexterity,
till she had assured herself that there was nothing left, and then she
gazed at Philip with vacant eyes; there was no thought, no gratitude in
their clear depths. Then she would play with him. She tried to take off
his boots to see his foot; she tore his gloves to shreds, and put on his
hat; and she would let him pass his hands through her hair, and take her
in his arms, and submit passively to his passionate kisses, and at last,
if he shed tears, she would gaze silently at him.

She quite understood the signal when he whistled _Partant pour la
Syrie_, but he could never succeed in inducing her to pronounce her
own name--_Stephanie_. Philip persevered in his heart-rending task,
sustained by a hope that never left him. If on some bright autumn
morning he saw her sitting quietly on a bench under a poplar tree, grown
brown now as the season wore, the unhappy lover would lie at her feet
and gaze into her eyes as long as she would let him gaze, hoping that
some spark of intelligence might gleam from them. At times he lent
himself to an illusion; he would imagine that he saw the hard,
changeless light in them falter, that there was a new life and softness
in them, and he would cry, “Stephanie! oh, Stephanie! you hear me, you
see me, do you not?”

But for her the sound of his voice was like any other sound, the
stirring of the wind in the trees, or the lowing of the cow on which she
scrambled; and the colonel wrung his hands in a despair that lost none
of its bitterness; nay, time and these vain efforts only added to his
anguish.

One evening, under the quiet sky, in the midst of the silence and peace
of the forest hermitage, M. Fanjat saw from a distance that the Baron
was busy loading a pistol, and knew that the lover had given up all
hope. The blood surged to the old doctor’s heart; and if he overcame the
dizzy sensation that seized on him, it was because he would rather
see his niece live with a disordered brain than lose her for ever. He
hurried to the place.

“What are you doing?” he cried.

“That is for me,” the colonel answered, pointing to a loaded pistol on
the bench, “and this is for her!” he added, as he rammed down the wad
into the pistol that he held in his hands.

The Countess lay stretched out on the ground, playing with the balls.

“Then you do not know that last night, as she slept, she murmured
‘Philip?’” said the doctor quietly, dissembling his alarm.

“She called my name?” cried the Baron, letting his weapon fall.
Stephanie picked it up, but he snatched it out of her hands, caught the
other pistol from the bench, and fled.

“Poor little one!” exclaimed the doctor, rejoicing that his stratagem
had succeeded so well. He held her tightly to his heart as he went
on. “He would have killed you, selfish that he is! He wants you to die
because he is unhappy. He cannot learn to love you for your own sake,
little one! We forgive him, do we not? He is senseless; you are only
mad. Never mind; God alone shall take you to Himself. We look upon
you as unhappy because you no longer share our miseries, fools that we
are!... Why, she is happy,” he said, taking her on his knee; “nothing
troubles her; she lives like the birds, like the deer--”

Stephanie sprang upon a young blackbird that was hopping about, caught
it with a little shriek of glee, twisted its neck, looked at the dead
bird, and dropped it at the foot of a tree without giving it another
thought.

The next morning at daybreak the colonel went out into the garden to
look for Stephanie; hope was very strong in him. He did not see her,
and whistled; and when she came, he took her arm, and for the first time
they walked together along an alley beneath the trees, while the fresh
morning wind shook down the dead leaves about them. The colonel sat
down, and Stephanie, of her own accord, lit upon his knee. Philip
trembled with gladness.

“Love!” he cried, covering her hands with passionate kisses, “I am
Philip...”

She looked curiously at him.

“Come close,” he added, as he held her tightly. “Do you feel the beating
of my heart? It has beat for you, for you only. I love you always.
Philip is not dead. He is here. You are sitting on his knee. You are my
Stephanie, I am your Philip.”

“Farewell!” she said, “farewell!”

The colonel shivered. He thought that some vibration of his highly
wrought feeling had surely reached his beloved; that the heart-rending
cry, drawn from him by hope, the utmost effort of a love that must last
for ever, of passion in its ecstasy, striving to reach the soul of the
woman he loved, must awaken her.

“Oh, Stephanie! we shall be happy yet!”

A cry of satisfaction broke from her, a dim light of intelligence
gleamed in her eyes.

“She knows me!... Stephanie!...”

The colonel felt his heart swell, and tears gathered under his eyelids.
But all at once the Countess held up a bit of sugar for him to see; she
had discovered it by searching diligently for it while he spoke. What he
had mistaken for a human thought was a degree of reason required for a
monkey’s mischievous trick!

Philip fainted. M. Fanjat found the Countess sitting on his prostrate
body. She was nibbling her bit of sugar, giving expression to her
enjoyment by little grimaces and gestures that would have been thought
clever in a woman in full possession of her senses if she tried to mimic
her paroquet or her cat.

“Oh, my friend!” cried Philip, when he came to himself. “This is
like death every moment of the day! I love her too much! I could bear
anything if only through her madness she had kept some little trace of
womanhood. But, day after day, to see her like a wild animal, not even a
sense of modesty left, to see her--”

“So you must have a theatrical madness, must you!” said the doctor
sharply, “and your prejudices are stronger than your lover’s devotion?
What, monsieur! I resign to you the sad pleasure of giving my niece her
food, and the enjoyment of her playtime; I have kept for myself nothing
but the most burdensome cares. I watch over her while you are asleep,
I--Go, monsieur, and give up the task. Leave this dreary hermitage; I
can live with my little darling; I understand her disease; I study her
movements; I know her secrets. Some day you shall thank me.”

The colonel left the Minorite convent, that he was destined to see only
once again. The doctor was alarmed by the effect that his words made
upon his guest; his niece’s lover became as dear to him as his niece. If
either of them deserved to be pitied, that one was certainly Philip; did
he not bear alone the burden of an appalling sorrow?

The doctor made inquiries, and learned that the hapless colonel had
retired to a country house of his near Saint-Germain. A dream had
suggested to him a plan for restoring the Countess to reason, and the
doctor did not know that he was spending the rest of the autumn in
carrying out a vast scheme. A small stream ran through his park, and in
winter time flooded a low-lying land, something like the plain on the
eastern side of the Beresina. The village of Satout, on the slope of
a ridge above it, bounded the horizon of a picture of desolation,
something as Studzianka lay on the heights that shut in the swamp of the
Beresina. The colonel set laborers to work to make a channel to resemble
the greedy river that had swallowed up the treasures of France and
Napoleon’s army. By the help of his memories, Philip reconstructed on
his own lands the bank where General Eble had built his bridges. He
drove in piles, and then set fire to them, so as to reproduce the
charred and blackened balks of timber that on either side of the river
told the stragglers that their retreat to France had been cut off. He
had materials collected like the fragments out of which his comrades in
misfortune had made the raft; his park was laid waste to complete
the illusion on which his last hopes were founded. He ordered ragged
uniforms and clothing for several hundred peasants. Huts and bivouacs
and batteries were raised and burned down. In short, he omitted
no device that could reproduce that most hideous of all scenes. He
succeeded. When, in the earliest days of December, snow covered the
earth with a thick white mantle, it seemed to him that he saw the
Beresina itself. The mimic Russia was so startlingly real, that several
of his old comrades recognized the scene of their past sufferings. M.
de Sucy kept the secret of the drama to be enacted with this tragical
background, but it was looked upon as a mad freak in several circles of
society in Paris.

In the early days of the month of January 1820, the colonel drove over
to the Forest of l’Isle-Adam in a carriage like the one in which M.
and Mme. de Vandieres had driven from Moscow to Studzianka. The horses
closely resembled that other pair that he had risked his life to
bring from the Russian lines. He himself wore the grotesque and soiled
clothes, accoutrements, and cap that he had worn on the 29th of November
1812. He had even allowed his hair and beard to grow, and neglected his
appearance, that no detail might be lacking to recall the scene in all
its horror.

“I guessed what you meant to do,” cried M. Fanjat, when he saw the
colonel dismount. “If you mean your plan to succeed, do not let her
see you in that carriage. This evening I will give my niece a little
laudanum, and while she sleeps, we will dress her in such clothes as
she wore at Studzianka, and put her in your traveling-carriage. I will
follow you in a berline.”

Soon after two o’clock in the morning, the young Countess was lifted
into the carriage, laid on the cushions, and wrapped in a coarse
blanket. A few peasants held torches while this strange elopement was
arranged.

A sudden cry rang through the silence of night, and Philip and the
doctor, turning, saw Genevieve. She had come out half-dressed from the
low room where she slept.

“Farewell, farewell; it is all over, farewell!” she called, crying
bitterly.

“Why, Genevieve, what is it?” asked M. Fanjat.

Genevieve shook her head despairingly, raised her arm to heaven, looked
at the carriage, uttered a long snarling sound, and with evident signs
of profound terror, slunk in again.

“‘Tis a good omen,” cried the colonel. “The girl is sorry to lose her
companion. Very likely she sees that Stephanie is about to recover her
reason.”

“God grant it may be so!” answered M. Fanjat, who seemed to be affected
by this incident. Since insanity had interested him, he had known
several cases in which a spirit of prophecy and the gift of second
sight had been accorded to a disordered brain--two faculties which many
travelers tell us are also found among savage tribes.

So it happened that, as the colonel had foreseen and arranged, Stephanie
traveled across the mimic Beresina about nine o’clock in the morning,
and was awakened by an explosion of rockets about a hundred paces from
the scene of action. It was a signal. Hundreds of peasants raised a
terrible clamor, like the despairing shouts that startled the Russians
when twenty thousand stragglers learned that by their own fault they
were delivered over to death or to slavery.

When the Countess heard the report and the cries that followed, she
sprang out of the carriage, and rushed in frenzied anguish over the
snow-covered plain; she saw the burned bivouacs and the fatal raft about
to be launched on a frozen Beresina. She saw Major Philip brandishing
his sabre among the crowd. The cry that broke from Mme. de Vandieres
made the blood run cold in the veins of all who heard it. She stood face
to face with the colonel, who watched her with a beating heart. At first
she stared blankly at the strange scene about her, then she reflected.
For an instant, brief as a lightning flash, there was the same quick
gaze and total lack of comprehension that we see in the bright eyes of a
bird; then she passed her hand across her forehead with the intelligent
expression of a thinking being; she looked round on the memories that
had taken substantial form, into the past life that had been transported
into her present; she turned her face to Philip--and saw him! An awed
silence fell upon the crowd. The colonel breathed hard, but dared
not speak; tears filled the doctor’s eyes. A faint color overspread
Stephanie’s beautiful face, deepening slowly, till at last she glowed
like a girl radiant with youth. Still the bright flush grew. Life and
joy, kindled within her at the blaze of intelligence, swept through her
like leaping flames. A convulsive tremor ran from her feet to her heart.
But all these tokens, which flashed on the sight in a moment, gathered
and gained consistence, as it were, when Stephanie’s eyes gleamed with
heavenly radiance, the light of a soul within. She lived, she thought!
She shuddered--was it with fear? God Himself unloosed a second time
the tongue that had been bound by death, and set His fire anew in the
extinguished soul. The electric torrent of the human will vivified the
body whence it had so long been absent.

“Stephanie!” the colonel cried.

“Oh! it is Philip!” said the poor Countess.

She fled to the trembling arms held out towards her, and the embrace
of the two lovers frightened those who beheld it. Stephanie burst into
tears.

Suddenly the tears ceased to flow; she lay in his arms a dead weight, as
if stricken by a thunderbolt, and said faintly:

“Farewell, Philip!... I love you.... farewell!”

“She is dead!” cried the colonel, unclasping his arms.

The old doctor received the lifeless body of his niece in his arms as a
young man might have done; he carried her to a stack of wood and set
her down. He looked at her face, and laid a feeble hand, tremulous with
agitation, upon her heart--it beat no longer.

“Can it really be so?” he said, looking from the colonel, who stood
there motionless, to Stephanie’s face. Death had invested it with
a radiant beauty, a transient aureole, the pledge, it may be, of a
glorious life to come.

“Yes, she is dead.”

“Oh, but that smile!” cried Philip; “only see that smile. Is it
possible?”

“She has grown cold already,” answered M. Fanjat.

M. de Sucy made a few strides to tear himself from the sight; then he
stopped, and whistled the air that the mad Stephanie had understood;
and when he saw that she did not rise and hasten to him, he walked away,
staggering like a drunken man, still whistling, but he did not turn
again.



In society General de Sucy is looked upon as very agreeable, and
above all things, as very lively and amusing. Not very long ago a lady
complimented him upon his good humor and equable temper.

“Ah! madame,” he answered, “I pay very dearly for my merriment in the
evening if I am alone.”

“Then, you are never alone, I suppose.”

“No,” he answered, smiling.

If a keen observer of human nature could have seen the look that Sucy’s
face wore at that moment, he would, without doubt, have shuddered.

“Why do you not marry?” the lady asked (she had several daughters of her
own at a boarding-school). “You are wealthy; you belong to an old and
noble house; you are clever; you have a future before you; everything
smiles upon you.”

“Yes,” he answered; “one smile is killing me--”

On the morrow the lady heard with amazement that M. de Sucy had shot
himself through the head that night.

The fashionable world discussed the extraordinary news in divers
ways, and each had a theory to account for it; play, love, ambition,
irregularities in private life, according to the taste of the speaker,
explained the last act of the tragedy begun in 1812. Two men alone, a
magistrate and an old doctor, knew that Monsieur le Comte de Sucy was
one of those souls unhappy in the strength God gives to them to enable
them to triumph daily in a ghastly struggle with a mysterious horror. If
for a minute God withdraws His sustaining hand, they succumb.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
