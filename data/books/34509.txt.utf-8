PREFACE


With the steadily increasing cost of all staple foods the need of
intelligent buying, cooking, and serving is greater than ever before:
more money must be spent for food, or more consideration must be given
to selecting and using it. For those who would continue to serve their
households well, and whose allowance for food has not kept pace with
prices, there is only one alternative, and that is, to use more of the
cheaper foods, and to prepare and combine them so skilfully that economy
shall not be a hardship. Good meals depend not so much upon expensive
material as upon care and good judgment in the use of ordinary material.
The time-worn boarding-house jokes about prunes and hash mean simply
that these foods, in themselves excellent, are poorly prepared and too
frequently served.

It is the plan of this book to include a variety of (1) recipes which
require only a small amount of meat; (2) recipes for vegetable dishes
which can take the place of meat; (3) recipes for the economical use of
cereals, dairy products, and other common inexpensive foods; (4) recipes
for breads, cakes, and desserts requiring only a small amount of butter
and eggs; and (5) recipes for a few relishes, condiments, and other
accessories which lend variety and interest. The General Suggestions for
Economy (Chapter I) are not all new, but are liable, through disuse, to
be forgotten by the present generation. Spasmodic economy counts for
little in the long run; only systematic and continued watchfulness is
really worth while.

Economy, however, ought not to necessitate the total elimination of
one's favorite cuts of steak, nor all of the little luxuries, because by
the skilful planning of the majority of the meals the occasional use of
these luxuries can be made possible.

This book is not intended as a complete guide to cookery; it presupposes
an elementary knowledge of the care and preparation of food.

The study of Tables D and E in the Appendix is especially recommended as
an aid to the better understanding of food values.

CHAPTER I

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR ECONOMY


PLANNING MEALS

In order to buy, prepare, and serve food to the best possible advantage,
an elementary knowledge of the composition and nutritive value of foods,
and the necessary food requirement of the family, is essential. Many
books are published on these subjects, but from the government
publications alone (see page 255) an excellent working knowledge may be
obtained. Only the merest outline can be given here, and this should be
supplemented by further reading.

Briefly stated, food is divided into three chief classes:[1]
(1) _Protein_, which builds and repairs the tissues.[2] It is furnished
chiefly by meats, fish, cheese, milk, eggs, cereals, and legumes.
(2) _Fats_, which furnish heat and energy, but are chiefly valuable for
storing a reserve supply of fat in the body. They are furnished largely
by butter, cream, olive and similar vegetable oils, bacon and other fat
meats. (3) _Carbohydrates_, which furnish heat and energy. They are
supplied chiefly by potatoes and other vegetables, cereals, fruits, and
sugars.

People who are eating the proper amount and kind of food should
approximate the normal weight[3] for their sex, age, and height. For the
proper maintenance of the body, a man of average height and weight, of
sedentary life,[4] requires daily food which will yield about 2,500
calories;[5] a woman of average height and weight, about 2,300 calories
(more or less according to activity). Children between two and five
years require from 1,200 to 1,400 calories; between five and ten years,
from 1,400 to 1,900 calories; and from ten to fourteen years, from 1,900
to 2,500 calories. Girls between fourteen and seventeen years require
from 2,200 to 2,600 calories; and boys between fourteen and seventeen
years, from 2,500 to 3,000 calories. Of the total number of calories
furnished ten per cent. should be protein, approximately 30 per cent.
fat, and 60 per cent. carbohydrates.

Before planning meals the consideration of these caloric requirements
and the study of the "Caloric Value of Average Portions of Food" (Table
D, page 245) and of the "Fuel Value of Raw Materials" (Table E, page
250) will help in the selection of foods to yield approximately the
desired amount of nutrition. It is not necessary or desirable that the
exact amount of each class of foods should be reckoned daily; but by the
general study of foods and their nutritive value, and the food
requirements of the body, which vary with age, sex, and conditions, the
housekeeper may serve her family with the kinds and amount of food best
suited to their needs. She should plan to use in a week as large a
variety of food as possible, and to avoid an excess of any one class.
With a definite idea of the needs of the family, she should take account
of the stock in the ice-box and pantry, and see that every bit of food
is utilized to advantage. Meals should be planned in detail at least one
day in advance, and, if possible, outlined for several days ahead;
though these plans must, of course, be varied slightly, at times,
according to the amount of left-over material and the exigencies of
supply and demand. Each day's programme should be plainly written; any
special recipes to be used noted; and a list made of supplies to be
ordered. To have the meals planned well in advance and the order list
ready saves a deal of nervous energy, time, and money.


MARKETING

If possible, attend personally to your marketing and consider carefully
the quality, quantity, and cost of your purchases in relation to the
needs of your purse and your household. Ask for what you want, and try
hard to get it; but in trying to buy supplies at lowest prices be sure
that the time and nervous energy spent are not out of proportion to the
amount of money saved.


MEAT

In considering the price of meat, the amount of bone, fat, gristle, and
so forth should be taken into account. Many of the coarser and cheaper
parts contain as much nutriment as the more expensive cuts, and can, by
proper cooking, be made fully as palatable. See that every bit of
left-over meat is used to advantage and in a variety of ways; the rinds
of bacon and salt pork when cooked with spinach or other greens, or in
soups of peas or beans, add both flavor and richness.


THE STOCK POT

All trimmings and bones, both cooked and uncooked, and any left-over
bits of meat or gravy that are not needed for other dishes, should be
put into the stock pot, covered with cold water, and _simmered_ (_not
boiled_) with soup vegetables and savory herbs for three or four hours.
Almost any left-over vegetable can be added, including macaroni, rice,
and the scrapings of the cereal cooker. If the family is small, the
cereal cooker itself makes an excellent stock pot: to the remnants of
breakfast cereal, add any soup material at hand; cover with cold water;
cook slowly; strain; and, if necessary, add one or two bouillon cubes,
and a few drops of kitchen bouquet. When soup stock is lacking in
richness a small amount of gelatine improves the quality.

The water in which vegetables, macaroni, rice, or any meats, either
fresh or salt, are cooked contains valuable mineral matter as well as
flavor, and should be added wholly or in part to the stock pot. Order
corned meats lightly salted so that all of the stock may be used. Be
sure that all fat is removed from soup stock before using. Do not serve
greasy soups. When stock must be used before the fat has had time to
harden, skim off as much as possible, and remove what remains with clean
blotting paper, or a lump of ice wrapped in cheesecloth.


FISH

Fresh fish is offered in variety at all seasons of the year, and is a
valuable and comparatively inexpensive food; salted and smoked fish
contain much protein in a concentrated form; the canned varieties are
important, too, especially for the emergency shelf, as they furnish a
substantial, inexpensive food which can be served in many ways at short
notice.


GROCERIES

Groceries in sealed packages are, as a rule, slightly more expensive
than those sold in bulk; but they are cleaner, often fresher, and more
convenient to store and use.

BUTTER AND OTHER SHORTENING

To the taste of the average person, there is no real equivalent for the
flavor of fine creamery butter, but, for cooking, excellent results may
be obtained by the use of cheaper shortening, beginning with the common
household fats which are so often discarded. All drippings from the
roasts and fat from boiled meats should be carefully strained and saved;
beef and chicken fat may be used in many recipes, including those for
cookies, cakes, meat sauces, soups, and made dishes; bacon fat is
excellent for corn cake, meat sauces, and soups of peas, beans, or
lentils; sausage fat may be used for gingerbread, cookies, poultry
stuffing, and also for frying potatoes and other vegetables, for in
these the spicy flavoring is not objectionable. Both bacon and sausage
fat and that from soup stock are useful for basting lean roasts, fish,
or meat loaf. Any surplus fat, including that of lamb and mutton, should
be clarified and added to that in the frying kettle. Fat which cannot
be utilized for cooking should be made into kitchen soap.


COOKING FATS--OILS

There are many excellent brands of wholesome cooking fats and oils on
the market, including peanut, corn, and cottonseed oil, and compound
vegetable fats. Almost any of these costs less than butter.


OLEOMARGARINE

The best oleomargarine is wholesome and economical, and much to be
preferred to inferior grades of butter.


MILK

Milk, even at present prices, gives good return in food value.
Unsweetened evaporated milk, which is absolutely sterile and clean,
costs no more, and in some places costs less, than fresh milk, and can
be used to advantage to supplement the supply. Because of its
consistency it is an excellent substitute for cream in frozen desserts.


CREAM

When eggs are relatively cheaper than cream, the stiffly beaten white of
an egg may be used to advantage to mix with beaten cream. Thin cream
whipped with a whip churn is lighter and less expensive than heavy cream
beaten.


EGGS

Unless the winter's supply of eggs has been preserved in water glass,
guaranteed cold storage eggs will be found satisfactory, and much
cheaper than hennery eggs. Only enough for a few days should be bought
at a time, however, and they should be kept in a cold place until used.
Wash eggs before breaking, and save the shells for clearing boiled
coffee, soup, and aspic. For coating croquettes, dilute each beaten egg
with one-fourth cup of water or one-third cup of milk; cover unused
yolks with water to prevent drying, and pour off water before using.
Have both yolk and white of egg cold, so that they may be beaten more
quickly; add a pinch of salt to whites of eggs which are to be beaten
stiff, and beat in a current of air. Soft-boiled or dropped eggs not
used at table should be put back in boiling water, cooked hard, and used
for garnishing, egg sauce, etc.


CHEESE

Cheese is nutritious and, even at present prices, economical, as it
contains a large proportion of protein in concentrated form. It can be
successfully combined with many other foods, and every left-over bit
should be so used; when partly dry it should be put through the food
chopper, using a fine cutter; when very dry it should be grated and used
in sauces, soufflés, soups, and many other dishes. Cheese is more
readily digested if a pinch of baking soda is cooked with it. To keep
cheese moist and fresh, brush the cut surface with melted paraffin. Save
left-over Welsh rarebit for sandwich filling. The shells of Edam or
pineapple cheeses should not be thrown away, but be filled with creamed
macaroni, spaghetti, or rice, covered with crumbs, and baked in a hot
oven.


FRESH VEGETABLES

A variety of vegetables should be served daily, and those which contain
a large amount of protein, such as beans, lentils, and peas, should be
used not only as an accompaniment to meat, but, in combination with
other vegetables, sauces, bacon or other fats, as the substantial dish
of the meal.


DRIED VEGETABLES

Dried vegetables should be soaked in cold water for twelve hours or
longer, and then cooked slowly until tender; dried julienne should be
soaked for twenty-four hours before cooking.


MACARONI, NOODLES, RICE, CEREALS

Macaroni, noodles and similar pastas, rice, and the cereals furnish much
nutriment at low cost; oatmeal and corn meal are among our cheapest
foods.

Ready cooked cereals, though they are convenient and give variety to the
diet, are more expensive than raw cereals well cooked; not only do they
yield less food value, but, being dry, they require more cream or milk
to make them palatable.


LEFT-OVER VEGETABLES

Left-over vegetables and cereals, even in small quantities, should be
saved for use in entrées, desserts, salads, sauces, and soups. Celery
tops should be saved for flavoring and garnishing, the root stalk
chopped and added to the stock pot, and the outside stalks stewed,
creamed, or used for cream soup. The outside leaves of lettuce should be
shredded for salad, or, for any large quantity, cooked the same as
spinach.


CANNED VEGETABLES

The flavor of canned vegetables is improved if, before being cooked,
they are rinsed with cold water and exposed to the air. Parsley and
chives may be kept growing in pots in the kitchen window to be used as
needed.


SALADS

Salads should be freely used at all seasons, and be made light or
nourishing according to the foods served with them. They offer an
opportunity to the housekeeper to exercise her ingenuity in combining
various vegetables, meats, and fruits, especially left-over bits. Crisp
white cabbage, shredded, may be used in place of celery.


SALAD DRESSINGS

Salad dressings need not necessarily be made of olive oil, for there are
other good and less expensive vegetable oils well worth using, and many
of the cooked salad dressings without oil are excellent.


BREAD

Various kinds of bread should be freely used, especially whole wheat and
other cereal breads, and those containing raisins, dates, and prunes.
Watch the bread-box, and see that every bit of bread is used in some
way; the unused crusts should be dried, rolled, sifted, and kept in a
covered jar for stuffing, crumbing croquettes, brown bread, puddings, or
other dishes in which the color is not objectionable; cold toast or cut
slices should be made into croutons, or used for canapés or French
toast; other pieces should be used for croustades, or made into crumbs,
both coarse and fine, for use in fondues, griddle cakes, omelets,
sauces, and soups. Bits of crackers should be dried, rolled, and used
the same as bread crumbs.

None of the recipes for cake require more than two eggs; many, only one;
and some, none at all. Water may always be used in place of milk, and
any clean, fresh shortening may be substituted for butter, especially in
the recipes which include molasses and spices. These cakes will not keep
moist like richer cakes, however, and should be used soon after making.

Slices of stale cake and crumbs should be utilized in making other
desserts in combination with custards, ices, preserves, etc.


BAKING POWDER

Do not use more baking powder than is necessary for good results; two
_level_ teaspoons to each cup of flour is the usual allowance, but one
and one-half teaspoons each to each cup will be sufficient if the
muffins, biscuits, or cake are quickly and lightly handled and properly
baked.


FLAVORING EXTRACTS

When volatile flavoring extracts are used in cake, much of their
strength is wasted during baking; grated rind or spices could well be
used in their place, or only the icing or filling flavored. All
desserts, whenever practicable, should be flavored when cold.


COLORING

The small package of red coloring which comes with gelatine is useful
for coloring cakes, icings, and other desserts as well as jellies.


FRUITS

Fruits, either fresh, dried, or preserved, should be served at least
once a day; dried fruits, such as apricots, peaches, and prunes, should
be soaked in cold water for twelve hours or longer and then cooked
slowly until tender. Raisins, dates, and figs yield a large food value
at comparatively low cost. Bananas, which contain more nutriment than
most fresh fruits, should be used for salads or desserts when the other
courses are light. In cooking acid fruits, such as cranberries, plums,
and cherries, less sugar is required if added after cooking. Parings and
cores from quinces and apples can be made into excellent jelly; the
rinds of watermelons are the foundation of a delicious sweet pickle;
orange and grape fruit peel, when candied, are well worth the trouble of
making. Surplus orange, lemon, and grape fruit peels, when dried, are
not only useful for flavoring, but make an interesting and aromatic fuel
for the fire-place; the nut meat found in prune stones tastes much like
that of bitter almonds and can be used in place of them.

When making jelly remember that the pulp of the fruit after the juice
has dripped from it may be made into excellent marmalade: cover with
water, heat to boiling point, press through a sieve, add three-quarters
of the amount of sugar, and cook until thick.


CANDIES

In spite of its cost, candy is now classed by many with the necessities
rather than with the luxuries. After a little practice even the most
elaborate candies can be successfully made at home, and the difference
between the cost of a pound of the best ready-made candy and the cost of
the raw materials is astonishing. For those who can spare the time,
candy-making will prove both fascinating and economical. Recipes for a
few after-dinner candies are given.


CONDIMENTS

A small supply of condiments and relishes, including kitchen bouquet,
ketchup, and sweet herbs, and one or two table sauces, should be kept in
stock, as they make possible a greater variety of flavors. Many
home-made sauces and relishes can be easily and quickly prepared and are
usually much cheaper than the ready-made varieties.


CANDLE STUBS

Candle stubs should be melted, strained through cheesecloth, and used
for sealing ketchup, jellies, and preserves.


GARNISHINGS

Any dish, attractively garnished and served, pleases the eye, stimulates
the appetite, and often lifts a simple meal out of the commonplace.
Parsley, mint, celery tops, red and green peppers, olives, pickles,
capers, cooked beets and carrots, hard-cooked egg, lemon cut in various
shapes, nuts, cherries, and other small fruits are all effective if not
too lavishly used.


UTENSILS

A reasonable equipment of kitchen utensils and a convenient, systematic
arrangement of them will save time and strength. Kitchen scales are
almost indispensable, and a cooking thermometer eliminates guesswork,
especially in boiling sugar and heating fat for frying. Pans, molds, and
cutters of various shapes prevent monotony; suitable baking dishes and
covered casserole dishes simplify both cooking and serving; and food
cooked or served in individual dishes is often more attractive. When
the cogs of the egg beater slip, do not discard it, but tighten the
rivet; keep knives well sharpened. Cream jars, jugs, bottles, or any
other containers for which a charge is made, should be promptly returned
to be credited.


FUEL

Do not waste fuel; concentrate your cooking; when a hot oven is needed
for roasting meat or baking bread, plan to cook at the same time other
things which require a high temperature; potatoes can be cooked in the
pan with the meat; other vegetables and fruits can be cooked in the
oven; and if a coal fire is used, a variety of food can be cooked in a
steamer on top of the range without extra fuel.

Have the ashes sifted and save the _cinders_, which yield a quick top
heat.

Economize _gas_ by using the minimum amount necessary to keep food
cooking at the desired temperature. When the boiling point is reached a
small supply of gas will maintain the temperature.

_Fireless cookers_ save much fuel and unnecessary heat, and are
especially useful for any food which requires long, slow cooking, or for
those foods of strong odor which so often scent up the whole house.

SPECIAL NOTICE


All ingredients in these recipes should be measured level, and the
standard teaspoon, tablespoon, and half-pint measuring cup should be
used.

Unless otherwise stated, one apple, onion, orange, etc., means one of
medium size.

Sift flour before measuring, and fill cup lightly. Use pastry flour,
unless otherwise directed, for thickening soups and sauces, and in all
recipes where baking powder is used; use bread flour in all recipes
where yeast is used.

The majority of these recipes are planned to serve four persons; those
for chowders and other dishes which form the substantial part of the
meal are sufficient for second helpings; those for cakes, muffins, and
other breads are large enough to be served more than once.




CHAPTER II

COMMON WAYS OF COOKING FOOD


_Baking_ is cooking in confined heat in the oven. Examples: bread, cake,
meat. This method when applied to meat is commonly called roasting.
Before baking, see that the oven is clean and heated to the desired
temperature.

_Boiling_ is cooking by immersion in water at 212° F. Examples:
potatoes, cabbage, macaroni.

_Braising_ is a combination of stewing on the top of the range, and
baking in the oven, with or without vegetables. Examples: tough meats,
fowl, whole liver.

_Broiling or Grilling_ is cooking over or under direct heat, as over
glowing coals or under a gas flame. Examples: steak, chops.

_Fricasseeing_ is commonly a combination of stewing and sautéing.
Examples: fowl, forequarter of lamb or veal.

_Frying_ is cooking by immersion in hot deep fat. Examples: doughnuts,
croquettes.

_Pan-baking or Pan-broiling_ is cooking in a lightly greased or
ungreased hot frying pan or griddle. Examples: steak, English muffins,
griddle cakes.

_Pot Roasting_ is cooking in an iron kettle or earthen pot in a small
amount of water, after meat has been quickly browned in a small amount
of fat in the frying pan or kettle. Cook slowly until very tender, with
or without vegetables.

_Roasting_ is cooking before an open fire. This method is seldom used in
small households, although the baking of meats is commonly called
roasting.

_Sautéing_ is cooking in a small amount of fat in a shallow pan on top
of range. Examples: sliced fish, meat, potatoes, eggs.

_Simmering_ is cooking in liquid at 185° F. The bubbles should always be
below the surface. Examples: ham, corned beef, soups.

_Steaming._ _Dry Steaming_ is cooking by heat of steam, as in double
boiler or tin, over or surrounded by boiling water. Examples: rice,
brown bread. _Moist Steaming_ is cooking by direct contact with steam as
in a steamer or colander, over boiling water, closely covered. Examples:
fowl, puddings, dumplings.

_Stewing_ is cooking slowly in a small amount of water (about 160° F.)
until food is very tender. Examples: beef, lamb, vegetables.

CHAPTER IX

MEATS[7]


119.--PRESSED BEEF

Wash a four-pound piece of beef flank or any other of the cheaper cuts.
Cover with boiling water, bring to boiling point, and skim; slice and
add two carrots, two onions, and one white turnip; cook slowly for four
hours or until meat is very tender; add two teaspoons of salt when half
cooked; pack meat solidly into a deep bread pan, putting the grain of
the meat lengthwise; place pan in a shallow pan to catch the overflow,
put an empty bread pan on top of meat, and press with two heavy
flatirons; let stand in a cool place over night. Strain the stock, and
use for soups or sauces.


120.--PRESSED CORNED BEEF

Select a four-pound piece of shoulder or lean end of brisket lightly
corned; wash well, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly for four
hours; pack and press as for Pressed Beef (see No. 119). The heat should
not be above the simmering point (185° F.): if the water boils the meat
will be tough.


121.--ROAST BEEF

The most economical cuts of beef for roasting are the shoulder, the face
of the rump, and the chuck ribs; they are all of good flavor and fairly
tender. When ordering a shoulder roast, have an inch slice cut off to
broil. The chuck roast should be ordered boned and rolled, and the bones
sent with it. Wipe beef with cheesecloth, place skin side down on a rack
in a roasting pan suitable for the size of the roast; dust with salt and
pepper, dredge with flour, and cook in a hot oven, basting every ten
minutes. When half roasted, turn over, dredge with flour, and finish
cooking. For a medium-cooked roast allow seventeen minutes for each
pound of meat. The oven should be very hot for the first fifteen
minutes, after which the heat should be reduced.


122.--POT ROAST OF BEEF

A small aitchbone or a solid piece from the shoulder weighing about five
pounds makes an economical roast. Wash, dry, season with salt and
pepper, dredge with flour, and brown quickly in a hot frying pan or
Scotch kettle; place in kettle, half cover with water, cover closely,
and cook slowly four hours; when half cooked, season with salt and
pepper; add four small onions, two carrots, and one white turnip cut in
quarters; when cooked place meat on platter with vegetables around it;
remove fat from gravy, and thicken with flour mixed to a paste with cold
water, allowing one-fourth cup of flour to two cups of gravy. Color with
a few drops of kitchen bouquet if necessary.


123.--SHIN OF BEEF WITH CREOLE SAUCE

  4 pounds shin of beef        1/2 onion chopped
  1/2 onion sliced             1/4 teaspoon celery salt
  1/2 carrot sliced            1/4 teaspoon paprika
  2 cups tomato                1/2 teaspoon salt
  1 green pepper chopped       4 tablespoons dried bread crumbs

Wash meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper; put into an iron kettle or
earthen crock; add onion and carrot; cover closely, and bake in a slow
oven four hours. Remove meat from the bone; skim fat from stock. Cook
tomatoes, pepper, onion, and seasonings twenty minutes; add stock,
crumbs, and meat. The meat cooks in its own juice and will be very
tender.


124.--STUFFED SHIN OF BEEF

  4 pounds shin of beef       1 small white turnip
  1 onion                     1/2 teaspoon salt
  1 carrot                    1 quart boiling water

Have the bone removed and cracked; finely chop vegetables and stuff into
beef; place on a trivet in kettle with the bone; add boiling water, and
cook slowly for four hours. Skim when necessary. Remove meat, and
thicken gravy with flour mixed to a paste with cold water, allowing
one-fourth cup flour to two cups gravy. Color with a few drops of
kitchen bouquet.


125.--TO BROIL STEAK

Wipe steak, trim off superfluous fat, place on a greased broiler with
fat towards the handle, and broil over a clear fire or under a gas
flame. Turn four or five times during the first minute, and then
occasionally. For steak an inch and a half thick, medium cooked, allow
twelve minutes to broil. Season with salt and pepper, and spread with
soft butter. A slice from the shoulder is a good and inexpensive cut.


126.--BROILED FLANK STEAK

Follow directions for broiling steak (see No. 125), but, as flank steak
is thinner, broil only seven or eight minutes. Season with salt and
pepper, spread with one tablespoon of soft butter and one tablespoon of
tomato ketchup.


127.--STEAK COUNTRY STYLE

  1-1/2 pounds flank steak       1/3 teaspoon salt
  4 onions                       1/8 teaspoon pepper
  1 tablespoon flour             1/4 cup boiling water

Pound the steak with a meat pounder or a wooden potato masher to break
the tough fibers. Sear quickly on each side in a very hot frying pan;
peel and chop onions, dredge with flour, and put in pan with the steak;
add salt and pepper; cover closely, and cook slowly an hour and a half.
Put steak on platter, add boiling water to onions, and pour around
steak. Serve with hashed brown potatoes.


128.--BROILED CHOPPED BEEF

Put one pound and a half of any of the cheaper cuts of beef through the
meat chopper; season with pepper and salt, and pat lightly into a flat
cake an inch thick; place carefully on a greased broiler, and broil
about eight minutes for a medium-cooked steak. Spread with soft butter.


129.--HAMBURG MEAT CAKES

  1 pound beef                 1 teaspoon salt
  1 thin slice salt pork       1/8 teaspoon pepper

Use any of the cheaper cuts of beef; put through the meat chopper with
the salt pork, add crumbs, seasoning, and milk; mix well, shape into
small flat cakes, roll in flour, and sauté slowly in beef drippings
until brown, allowing ten minutes for each side. Remove meat to platter;
add two tablespoons of flour to the fat in the pan, and stir until
brown; add one-fourth teaspoon each of mustard, salt, and paprika, and
one cup of boiling water. Stir until smooth, and pour around meat cakes.
One teaspoon of grated onion may be added to meat.


130.--BEEF AND BACON CAKES

  3 slices bacon                   1/4 teaspoon salt
  1/4 cup dried bread crumbs       Dash of cayenne

  1/4 pound salt pork chopped              3 common crackers rolled fine
  1/2 teaspoon pepper                      1 cup milk

Mix in order given and bake in a deep pan about two hours in a slow
oven. Serve hot with Tomato Sauce (see No. 203) or Creole Sauce (see No.
191), or serve cold, sliced. One teaspoon of poultry seasoning may be
added if desired.


132.--CASSEROLE OF BEEF

  1 pound of shoulder trimmings       1 tablespoon pearl tapioca
  1 tablespoon flour                  1-1/4 teaspoons salt
  2 potatoes                          1/4 teaspoon paprika
  1 carrot                            1 tablespoon tomato ketchup
  1 onion                             Cold water

Cut beef into inch pieces, sear quickly in hot frying pan, dredge with
flour, and put into casserole; cut potatoes into cubes or balls; put
carrot and onion through meat chopper; mix vegetables, and add to meat;
add tapioca and seasonings, cover with cold water (a little of the water
should be put into the frying pan to obtain all the flavor of the meat,
and then added to the rest). Cover, and bake slowly two and a half
hours. Any of the other cheaper cuts of meat may be used. Serve with
spinach or cold slaw.


133.--CREAMED DRIED BEEF WITH CHEESE

  3/4 pound flank beef chopped fine       1/8 teaspoon pepper
  1 can condensed tomato soup

Cook onion and beef in fat until brown; add tomato, spaghetti, and
seasonings, and simmer ten minutes.


135.--BROWN FRICASSEE OF LAMB

  2 pounds forequarter lamb       2 white turnips
  2 quarts boiling water          2 carrots
  1-1/2 teaspoons salt            5 tablespoons flour
  2 onions                        1/4 teaspoon kitchen bouquet

Cut lamb in pieces the size of a chop, trim off nearly all fat, add
boiling water, heat to boiling point, and skim; add salt and vegetables
(left whole), and simmer for two hours; remove meat, season with salt
and pepper, dredge with flour, and sauté with two tablespoons of fat in
a hot frying pan until brown; to the fat in the pan add the flour, and
stir until brown, add two cups of stock, and stir until smooth; color
with kitchen bouquet, add pepper, and salt if necessary. Slice
vegetables, and serve with meat. Use left-over stock for soups or
sauces.


136.--CASSEROLE OF LAMB

  1-1/2 pounds forequarter lamb            2 tablespoons rolled oats
  1/2 cup each white turnip, carrot,       1/4 teaspoon pepper
    and onion finely chopped               1-1/2 teaspoons salt
  1 cup tomato                             3 cups hot water

Remove fat and cut meat into inch pieces; put into a casserole with
vegetables, oats, seasonings, and water, and cook in a moderate oven two
hours.


137.--LAMB CHOPS

Chops from the forequarter are much cheaper than loin or kidney chops.
They contain more bone, but are tender and of good flavor, if well
cooked. Cook the same as Lamb Cutlets (see No. 138). The time of cooking
may vary slightly according to the thickness of the meat.


138.--LAMB CUTLETS

Have a small forequarter of lamb cut in pieces for serving; select the
best pieces, trim, and skewer into shape. Season lightly with salt and
pepper, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in deep fat about seven minutes;
or dip in flour, and sauté on each side about ten minutes; or broil on
each side about five minutes. The rest of the forequarter can be used
for fricassee, Scotch broth, croquettes, and many other dishes.


139.--ROLLED ROAST OF LAMB

Order a small forequarter of lamb boned and rolled; have the bones sent
with the meat; wash bones and meat, put bones in kettle, put meat on
top; add one sliced onion, one sliced carrot, one bay leaf, and a sprig
of thyme. Cover with two quarts of boiling water, and simmer for two
hours, skimming when necessary; add two teaspoons of salt after meat has
cooked one hour. Remove meat to a roasting pan, sprinkle with salt and
pepper, dredge with flour, and roast in a hot oven about half an hour.
To the drippings in the pan add four tablespoons of flour and stir until
brown; add one and a half cups of stock which has been strained and had
fat removed; stir until smooth and serve with meat. The left-over stock
should be used for soups and sauces. The forequarter of lamb, although
quite fat, is tender and of good flavor, and costs much less than a leg
of lamb.


140.--BROWN FRICASSEE OF FOWL

Clean, singe, and cut up a four-pound fowl, place in a kettle, cover
with boiling water, add one whole onion, and one carrot cut in halves,
and cook slowly for three hours, or until tender; add two teaspoons of
salt when half cooked; remove fowl, season with salt and pepper, dredge
with flour, and brown in one-quarter of a pound of fat salt pork tried
out in the frying pan. Remove fowl to platter, and make a sauce in the
pan with four tablespoons of fat, five tablespoons of flour browned
together, and two cups of stock. Pour over fowl, and garnish with toast
points or small, thin baking powder biscuit. The remainder of the stock
may be used for soup or sauce, or for Celery Toast (see No. 462).


141.--ROAST FOWL

Clean and singe a five-pound fowl; stuff with Bread Stuffing (see No.
208), truss, place on a trivet in a pan suited to the size of the fowl,
dredge with flour, cover with thin slices of fat salt pork, and bake in
a slow oven three hours, basting every fifteen minutes. Put into the pan
the chicken fat (which was removed when cleaning) and use for basting.
Dredge with flour twice while cooking. Cook the giblets in boiling water
one hour, and chop fine; make a gravy in the pan, allowing four
tablespoons each of fat and flour, and the water in which giblets were
cooked, with enough boiling water added to make two cups; season with
salt and pepper, and add the giblets. If cooked slowly and basted often,
a fowl will be as tender as a chicken.


142.--CHICKEN PIE

Use the remnants of cold roast or fricasseed fowl. If roast fowl is
used, make stock by covering bones and left-over gravy with cold water
and simmering an hour or more; to three cups of stock add one-half onion
chopped, two potatoes cut in half-inch cubes, one teaspoon salt, and
one-eighth teaspoon pepper, and boil fifteen minutes; thicken with
one-half cup of flour mixed to a paste with cold water; put chicken in a
baking dish, add stock and potato, and cover with small biscuit made by

212.--BOILED EGGS

For a soft-boiled egg, place egg in rapidly boiling water and boil from
three to five minutes. For hard-boiled eggs, place in rapidly boiling
water and boil twenty minutes, or cover with boiling water and cook in
the double boiler one hour. For a soft-cooked egg, not boiled, place egg
in a small saucepan of boiling water, cover, and let stand on back of
range from six to eight minutes, when the albumen should be evenly
coagulated throughout. The time for cooking in this way will depend upon
the number of eggs to be cooked, the size of the saucepan, and the
amount of boiling water. For uniform results, use medium-sized eggs,
cook in the same pan, and measure the quantity of water each time. Thus
you can find the exact time required to cook the eggs as desired.

FOOTNOTES:

[11] The amount of soda in these recipes is based upon the use of
old-fashioned jug molasses; canned molasses varies greatly in acidity
and, especially when freshly opened, requires little or no soda. If
canned molasses is used, therefore, baking powder should wholly or
partly take the place of soda.

PASTRIES


619.--PLAIN PASTE

  1-1/2 cups flour                 1/4 cup shortening
  1/4 teaspoon salt                1/3 cup ice water
  1/4 teaspoon baking powder       1/4 cup butter

Sift flour, salt, and baking powder; rub in shortening with finger tips
until mixture is like fine meal; add water gradually until a soft but
not sticky dough is formed, mixing with a knife; when dough is mixed,
the side of the bowl should be clean, neither sticky nor dry with flour.
Slightly more or less water may be needed. Roll paste, on a lightly
floured board, into an even rectangular shape; divide butter into three
parts; cover two-thirds of paste with dots of butter, using one part;
fold first the unbuttered third, then the remaining third, so that there
will be three layers of paste with butter between; roll out again, dot
with butter as before, and fold; repeat for third time. Put paste on ice
until thoroughly chilled. Any good shortening may be used in place of
butter, but the butter flavor will be lacking. This is enough for one
pie with two crusts; double the amount of paste can be made with the
same amount of labor. It keeps well if wrapped in cheesecloth and put in
a cool place.


620.--RICH PASTE

  1 teaspoon sugar        1 tablespoon lemon juice
  1/2 teaspoon salt       Ice water

Sift flour, sugar, and salt; add shortening, and rub in with finger tips
or chop with a knife in each hand until mixture is like fine meal; add
lemon juice and enough water to form a stiff paste (about two-thirds of
a cup); roll out into a thin sheet and fold in four layers; roll out and
fold three times. Chill before using. This rule makes two pies. It is
less expensive than puff paste, and yet is a very good substitute for
it.


621.--PATTY SHELLS

oven about twelve minutes. Remove pans, and fill with any cooked fruit
mixture, berries, or creamed meats or vegetables.


622.--PIE SHELL

Roll paste one-quarter inch thick, cover an inverted tin pie plate,
trim, and press the edges firmly; prick with a fork, place on a baking

rounds, moisten the edges of half of them with cold water, cut out the
centers of the other half with a small cutter, place upon whole rounds,
and press firmly together; chill, and bake in a hot oven about twenty
minutes. Fill with jelly, jam, or fruit paste. When shells are to be
filled with creamed meats, etc., cut with a larger cutter.

  4 cups granulated sugar       1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
  1 cup boiling water

Put sugar in a smooth, clean saucepan, add boiling water, and stir until
dissolved; heat slowly to boiling point, add cream of tartar, and boil
without stirring to 240° F., or until sirup will form a soft ball when
tested in cold water. As sirup granulates around the sides of saucepan,
wash down with a clean brush which has been dipped quickly into cold
water; pour out upon a slightly oiled slab or large platter; as the
edges begin to harden, turn them toward the center, and when the mixture
is partly cooled work with a wooden spatula or butter paddle until
creamy; when it begins to lump, knead with the hands until smooth. Let
stand a few hours before using, or keep in a covered jar until needed.


685.--COFFEE FONDANT

Follow recipe for Plain Fondant (see No. 684), using strong, clear
coffee in place of water. Or, if only a small quantity is needed, melt

coffee to each cup. This may be used melted for mints, or for dipping,
or, when cooled, for centers.


686.--BONBON CENTERS

until dissolved; add cream of tartar, and boil to 234° F., or about five
minutes; cool slightly, add flavoring, beat until creamy, and drop from
a teaspoon on an oiled slab or platter. If mixture thickens before all
is used, add a few drops of boiling water. Oil or essence of
wintergreen, lime, orange, etc., may be used instead of spearmint, and
mixture may be colored lightly to correspond with flavoring.

heat gradually to the boiling point, and boil to 258° F., or until candy
becomes brittle when tested in cold water; add flavoring, pour on an

Produced by Annie McGuire. This book was produced from
scanned images of public domain material from the Google
Print archive.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
