Drawings and Pharmacy in al-Zahrāwī’s
10th-Century Surgical Treatise

_by Sami Hamarneh_


_Probably the earliest independent work in Arabic Spain to embrace the
whole of medical knowledge of the time is the encyclopedic al-Tasrīf,
written in the late 10th century by Abū al-Qāsim al-Zahrāwī, also known
as Abulcasis. Consisting of 30 treatises, it is the only known work of
al-Zahrāwī and it brought him high prestige in the western world._

_Here we are concerned only with his last treatise, on surgery. With its
many drawings of surgical instruments, intended for the instruction of
apprentices, its descriptions of formulas and medicinal preparations,
and its lucid observations on surgical procedures, this treatise is
perhaps the oldest of its kind._

_Scholars today have available a translation of the text and
reproductions of the drawings, but many of the latter are greatly
modified from the originals._

_This study reproduces examples of al-Zahrāwī’s original illustrations,
compares some with early drawings based on them, and comments on
passages in the treatise of interest to students of pharmacy and medical
therapy._

THE AUTHOR: _Sami Hamarneh undertook this research into the history of
medicine in connection with his duties as associate curator of medical
sciences in the United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution._


THE INTRODUCTION OF THE WRITINGS of Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn ʻAbbās
al-Zahrāwī--better known as Abulcasis (d. ca. 1013)--to Western Europe
was through the Latin translation of his surgical treatise (maqālah) by
Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187).[1] The response to this treatise,
thereafter, was much greater than the attention paid to the surgery of
any of the three renowned physicians of the Eastern Caliphate: al-Rāzī
(Latin, Rhazes, d. ca. 925), the greatest clinician in Arabic medicine;
al-Majūsī (Haly Abbās, d. 994), the author of the encyclopedic medical
work, _al_-_Malakī_;[2] and Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, 980-1037), the author
of the famous _al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb_, a codification of the whole of
medical knowledge. Because of the widespread dissemination of this Latin
version in medieval Europe beginning with the latter part of the 12th
century, al-Zahrāwī attained more prestige in the West than he did in
Arabic Spain, his native country, or in any other part of the Islamic
world.[3]

The fame attached to this surgical treatise, the 30th and last in
al-Zahrāwī’s encyclopedic work _al-Taṣrīf Liman ‘Ajiza ‘an
al-Ta’līf_, is founded on certain merits. The text is characterized
by lucidity, careful description, and a touch of original
observation of the surgical operations to which the treatise as a
whole is devoted.[4] Al-Zahrāwī furnishes his own drawings of the
surgical and dental instruments he used, devised, or recommended for
a more efficient performance. The illustrations were intended to
provide instructional material for apprentices--whom al-Zahrāwī
calls his children--as well as for the benefit of those who would
read the work later on.[5] The treatise is probably the oldest one
known today that contains such instructive surgical illustrations
and text.[6]

This surgical treatise has been investigated, translated, and commented
upon by eminent historians of medicine and surgery to whose works I
shall refer in this article. However, the pharmaceutic and therapeutic
details of the treatise have been somewhat overlooked.

As to the various illustrations of the surgical instruments (over 200
figures in all), an almost complete representation of samples has been
introduced by Channing,[7] Leclerc,[8] Gurlt,[9] Sudhoff,[10] and
others. Nevertheless, a good number of the reproduced drawings are
greatly modified, most likely having been influenced by earlier
illustrations in several Latin and vernacular versions of the
treatise.[11] This becomes clearer on comparison with seven Arabic
manuscripts that have not been fully examined by Western scholars before
and that--in several instances--show more authentic drawings of
al-Zahrāwī’s surgical instruments than any heretofore published.[12]

This article therefore, is an attempt to present a sample of these
illustrations with brief comments regarding certain figures and passages
of interest to pharmacy and medical therapy.

With much gratitude I express my indebtedness to Prof. G. Folch Jou of
Madrid, to Dr. A. Süheyl Ünver and Mr. H. Dener of Istanbul, and to the
librarians of the depository institutions for their cooperation in the
reproduction of the manuscripts on microfilm.

Al-Zahrāwī frequently introduces his treatises with brief instructive
and sometimes informative preludes. However, in launching the last
treatise of _al-Taṣrīf_ he expounded in a most interesting and
illuminating manner the status of surgery during his time. He also
explains the reasons that forced him to write on this topic and why he
wished to include, as he did, precautions, advice, instructional notes,
and beautifully illustrated surgical drawings. For example, the prelude
to the treatise mentions four incidents that he witnessed, all ending
with tragic results because of the ignorance of physicians who attempted
to operate on patients without the proper training in anatomy and
surgical manipulation. "For if one does not have the knowledge of
anatomy," al-Zahrāwī protests, then "... he is apt to fall in errors
that lead to death as I have seen it happen to many."[13]

Al-Zahrāwī divides his surgical treatise into three sections (abwāb). In
the first section (56 chapters)[14] he elaborates upon the uses and
disadvantages of cautery in general. And on the ground that "fire
touches only the ailing part ... without causing much damage to
surrounding area," as caustic medicine does, he prefers cautery by fire
(al-kay bi al-nār) to cautery by medicine (bi al-dawā).[15] This, he
adds, "became clear to us through lifelong experience, diligent
practice, and thorough investigations of facts."[16]

  original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy

  _Albucasis_ (_Smithsonian photo 46891-C_). _Bottom_, from
  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_, courtesy National Library of
  Medicine.]

He also proposes that instruments made of iron are more practical in
many ways than those made of gold, because often, when gold instruments
are put in fire, they either are not heated enough or are overheated,
causing the gold to melt.

  [Illustration: Figure 10.--Dental scrapers. _Top_, from
  original Arabic manuscript (Vel. 2491), courtesy Süleymaniye

  Channing, _Albucasis_.]

Al-Zahrāwī gently refutes the superstition that cautery is "good only in
springtime," and states that "under the right conditions of the body’s
humors it could be used in all seasons."[17] Although he recommends
cautery rather highly, he never minimizes the importance of treatment
by drugs. Actually, he encourages the use of drugs, before, with, and
after cauterization.[18] For example, in chapter 16 on "the
cauterization of eyelid when its hair grows reversedly into the eye," he
recommends treatment by cautery and by medicine. In cautery, the area
where fire is to be placed is marked with ink in the shape of a myrtle
leaf. In drug treatment, the caustic medicine is applied to the eyelid
over a paper in the shape of a myrtle leaf (fig. 2).

  [Illustration: Figure 11.--Dental forceps. _Top_, from
  original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy
  Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Bottom_, from Leclerc,
  _Abulcasis_.]

In chapter 17 the author refers to an ancient method regarding cautery
of the fistula in the inner corner of the eye. After incising the
fistula, one "dirham" (derived from the Greek "drachma," which is equal
to about 2.97 grams)[19] of melted lead is poured into it through a fine
funnel used for cauterization (fig. 3).

  [Illustration: Figure 12.--Golden bridge to stabilize shaky
  teeth. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91),

  Argellata 1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.
  _Right_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]

In like manner, al-Zahrāwī discusses cautery of the stomach and the
"cold liver" in chapters 26 and 27, respectively. The drawings therein
represent shapes of the burns on the skin (fig. 4) and marks of ink to
be drawn beneath the cartilage of the ribs (fig. 5) for the purpose of
spotting the area of operation. Here also he describes carefully and
clearly the methods of applying cautery and the types, position, and
number of tools employed in each case. He likewise depicts (in chapter
45) instruments used in the treatment of hernia (fig. 6).

The second section (bāb), with about 99 chapters,[20] deals with
incision, puncturing, venesection, cupping, surgery on abscesses, and
the withdrawal of arrows from the body. Al-Zahrāwī warns that ignorance
in such operations may lead to damage of an artery or vein, causing loss
of blood "by which life is sustained."[21] Moreover, needle and thread
(more than one kind is mentioned) for the stitching of wounds are
repeatedly recommended.

According to al-Zahrāwī, foreign bodies that lodge in the ear (chapter
6) are of four origins: (1) "mineral stones" or substances resembling
mineral stones such as iron and glass; (2) plant seeds (chick-peas and
beans); (3) liquids, such as water and vinegar; and (4) animals, such
as fleas. Several instruments are recommended for the removal of such
foreign bodies--fine tweezers shaped like a dropper (fig. 7), a syringe
with plunger-pump, and a tube made of silver or copper (fig. 8). Also of
interest to pharmacy and therapy is the advice in regard to the use of
lubricants to be applied before administering these fine instruments
into the body’s cavities.

Chapter 24 is concerned with the treatment of the polypus that grows in
the nose. The various kinds (including cancer growth), shapes, and
colors of this type tumor and its treatment by surgery or medicine are
described. A hollowed nose-dropper made of metal in the shape of a small
kerosene lamp[22] is suggested (fig. 9). The dropper is held by its
handle while its contents are heated before use. Applying heat to nose
drops was probably proposed because it serves two purposes: it allows
easier flow of the "duhn," or the fatty substance used, and it raises
the temperature of the drops to that of the body.

In his discussion on dental hygiene,[23] al-Zahrāwī describes scrapers
and dental forceps for teeth cleaning and extraction (figs. 10, 11) and
brings in a few points of historical interest.[24] He warns of the
common error of extracting the adjacent healthy tooth instead of the
ailing one due to the patient’s sense deception. For a gargle he
prescribes salt water, vinegar, and wine (sharāb). To stop hemorrhage he
used blue vitriol (al-zāj)--copper sulfate in our modern terminology.

In chapter 33 al-Zahrāwī discusses bridge-making for the consolidation
of shaky teeth (fig. 12). He prefers the use of stable gold over silver
which, he says, putrifies and rots in a short time. In a rational
approach, he also suggests that the fallen tooth itself, or a similar
one shaped out of a cow’s bone, be installed and connected with
adjacent, stable teeth by a bridge.

Now, turning to chapter 36, we find al-Zahrāwī describing a knife-thin
tongue depressor (fig. 13) that he used to facilitate the examination of
inflamed tonsils and other swellings of the throat; it was made of
silver or copper. And in chapter 37 (chapter 34 in Bes. 503), he
describes the excision of an inflamed uvula by surgery. In the same
chapter, he also mentions the use of instruments made of steel. Of
pharmaceutical interest is the following free translation of the formula
he prescribes "as a milder treatment by fumigation ... to be resorted to
only when the swelling is subsiding":[25]

  Take pennyroyal [_Mentha pulegium_ Linn.], absinthe
  [_Artemisia maritima_ Linn.], thyme, rue, hyssop, camomile,
  abrotanum [_Artemisia abrotanum_ Linn.], and other similar
  herbs. Put all in a casserole and cover them with vinegar.
  Then close tightly with clay [_lutum-sapientiae_]--except
  for a small hole in the middle of the cover--and boil.
  Connect one end of a hollowed instrument, a crude form of an
  inhaler [fig. 14], with the hole in the cover and insert the
  other end, which contains the nozzle, into the patient’s
  mouth, allowing the vapor to rise up to the uvula. And if
  you are not able to secure this instrument, take a straw and
  attach its end to an egg-shell. The egg-shell will prevent
  burns in the patient’s mouth that might be caused by the
  heated vapor.

Al-Zahrāwī repeats in chapter 53, on cancer, what Greek physicians had
said earlier, that cancer could be removed by surgery only at its first
stage and when found in a removable part of the body, such as the
breast. Therefore, he confesses that neither he nor any one else he
knew of ever applied surgery with success on advanced cancer.[26]

Of special interest in chapter 59 is the metallic "syringe" (fig. 15)
used to inject medicinal solutions into the bladder: "The hollow passage
[of the syringe] should be exactly equal to the plunger it contains and
no more, so that when such fluids from an excess of humors are aspirated
they will be drawn out, and likewise when the solutions are injected
they will be pushed in easily." Such description of the use of a
"bladder syringe" in the late 10th century clearly points to the
practical and interesting approach to surgery in _al-Taṣrīf_. Moreover,
his description of the removal of a stone from the bladder--an operation
we now call lithotomy--is considered a contribution to bladder surgery.

One of the earliest recorded operations for the extractions of two dead
fetuses from the womb is clearly described in chapter 76. The account of
this case shows not only al-Zahrāwī’s intelligent approach as a shrewd
observer but also his clinical and surgical ability.

Drawings of bulb-syringe instruments used for administering enemas in
ailments of the rectum and for the treatment of diarrhea and colic are
depicted in chapter 83. The text describes several kinds of syringes
made of silver, porcelain, and copper in various sizes (fig. 16). Of
particular interest is an illustration of a syringe, especially
recommended for children, to which a piece of leather (jildah) is
attached (fig. 17). This instrument is a precursor of our modern bulb
syringe.

In chapter 84 al-Zahrāwī turns to the treatment of various wounds. He
prescribes the following powder formula for use: "Take olibanum
[frankincense] and dragon’s blood,[27] two parts of each, and three
parts of slaked or unslaked lime. Pound them well, pass through a sieve
and apply the powder to the wound." In cases of damaged blood vessels,
he tied the arteries by ligature, a practice of which he was a pioneer.
In another chapter he describes four methods for suturing the
intestines.

Al-Zahrāwī, being associated with war casualties and writing his
treatise about the end of the 10th century, no doubt had the experience
of dealing with cases involving injuries caused by arrows. The text in
chapter 94 discloses his observations in elaborate investigations
regarding the extraction of various kinds of arrows from the body.[28]
Accordingly, several kinds of hooks and forceps for removing arrows are
described and depicted in the treatise (see fig. 18). Al-Zahrāwī’s
mention of Turkish bows and arrows led Freind to believe, erroneously,
that the author of the treatise must have lived in the 12th century,[29]
notwithstanding the fact that Turkish bows and arrows were in common use
in the latter part of the 10th century.

  recommended for use with children. _Top_, from original
  Arabic manuscript (Ali 2854), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi
  Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Leclerc, _Abulcasis_.]

The next chapter, on cupping, mentions the use of cups made of horns,
wood, copper, or glass, according to circumstances and the availability
of material. The methods of treatment are divided into two kinds: dry
cupping, with or without fire, and wet cupping (see fig. 19). He
prescribes ointments and aromatic and medicated waters to be applied
before and after cupping to facilitate healing. Only when cupping is not
possible, as on the nose, fingers, and similar parts of the human body,
does he propose the use of leeches for treatment.[30] Evidently this is
an indication that he did not, as generally supposed, encourage the
widespread use of leeches.

The third and final section, of 35 chapters, deals with the reduction,
luxation, and treatment of injured bones, including fracture of the
pelvis. The advices and warnings in the prelude of this section appear
to repeat some of al-Zahrāwī’s sayings that had been covered in his
previous introductions. The text, however, presents many facets of
interest to the health professions. It elaborates upon the application
of various forms of bandages and plasters in a variety of operations.
Al-Zahrāwī’s detailed description relating to fractures of bones is a
fine anatomical document of historical interest. He illustrates and
describes special methods for tying injured or broken bones, and he
suggests that bandages made of soft linen be less and less tight as
distance increases from the injured place (chapter 1). For the
protection of areas adjacent to the injured part against contact with
edges of splints he advocates padding with soft gauze and carded wool.
In some cases, to guard against swelling, he preferred a delay of one or
more days in applying bandages over splints. Al-Zahrāwī also devised
and depicted many kinds and shapes of splints for use in simple and
compound fractures of the head, shoulders, arms, fingers, etc. (see fig.
20). For example, in discussing the reduction of the humerus, he
recommends a splint consisting of a smooth, thin stick bent in the shape
of a bow with two strings, each attached to one end of the stick (fig.
21). The injured bone is then placed in the middle of the bent splint
for reduction while the patient is seated on a chair. Tying is applied
only when there is no "hot" swelling (chapter 11). One of the remarkable
observations made in this section is the description of the paralysis
caused by fracture of the spine.

  [Illustration: Figure 20.--Splint "in the shape of a spoon
  without a bowl." _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript
  (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen.
  _Bottom_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]

Of interest to historians of medical therapy and pharmacy are the
recipes for poultices that al-Zahrāwī recommends for use over
fractured bones. For example, he gives the following recipe for one
such poultice: "Take the so-called 'mill’s dust' [ghubār al-rahā],
which is the part of the wheat flour that clings to the walls of the
mill during grinding [lubāb al-daqīq], and, without sifting away the
bran, knead with white-of-egg to a medium consistency, and apply."
Another, more elaborate, recipe calls for 10 dirhams each of the
roots of wild pomegranate [_Glossostemon bruguieri_ D.C.], chickling
vetch [the grass pea, _Lathymus sativus_], and white marshmallow; 5
dirhams each of myrrh and aloes; 6 dirhams of white gum Arabic
[_Acacia_]; and 20 dirhams of bole [friable earthy clay consisting
largely of hydrous silicates of aluminum and magnesium, usually
colored red because of impurities of iron oxide]. Procedure was to
pound all ingredients gently, pass them through a sieve, and knead
with water or white-of-egg (chapter 1).

  Argellata 1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.]

The question arises as to whether al-Zahrāwī did any human dissection.
The answer is uncertain because our knowledge of his life is
fragmentary. However, he gives no clue to the dissection of humans in
any of the 30 treatises of _al-Taṣrīf_--his only known writings--and
there is no evidence that he practiced it in secret. His upright
attitude as a Muslim who repeatedly emphasized his adherence to his
faith suggests that he relied completely on animal dissection and the
writings of his Greek-Roman and Islamic predecessors. Physicians in both
the Islamic domain and in Christendom for many centuries were hostile to
the idea of human dissection for any purpose because of their
traditional socio-religious convictions, considering it an unethical and
undignified practice. Perhaps it has been al-Zahrāwī’s original
contributions to surgery, his enthusiasm in emphasizing the value of
anatomical knowledge, and his recognition of the necessity that only
well-educated, well-trained doctors should perform surgery that have led
some medical historians to wonder whether he did human dissection at
some time in his long years of experience.


In Summary

The few examples of illustrations of surgical instruments given here
indicate that the Arabic manuscripts, in general, have preserved the
original, oriental, artistic features of the drawings in a way that has
been overlooked in Latin and vernacular versions of _al-Taṣrīf_.

In presenting his personal observations and original ideas on surgery
late in life, al-Zahrāwī, for the most part, was inspired by a thorough
acquaintance with Greek and Arabic medical literature supplemented by
lifelong intelligent observation and experience.

Through its descriptions and illustrations, the surgical treatise of
al-Zahrāwī very likely played a significant role in the designing of
improved surgical instruments in the Middle Ages. Also, the treatise no
doubt promoted the development of improved surgical techniques in Islam
and, through its translations, promoted these techniques to an even
greater extent in the West, a fact that justifies the fame of this
treatise as the highest expression of the development of surgery in
Arabic Spain--a treatise whose influence continued to the Renaissance.
It contributed in no small measure to the idea of equipping learned and
well-trained surgeons with the best surgical tools and techniques of the
time; moreover, it encouraged the invention of new instruments to meet
differing circumstances and special conditions. These tools no doubt
greatly facilitated the work of the surgeon.

Throughout the text of _al-Taṣrīf_ al-Zahrāwī gave careful attention
to the importance of pharmaceutical preparations in the healing art,
including cases requiring surgery.

  [6] Fielding H. Garrison (_An Introduction of the History of
  Medicine_, ed. 4, rev., Philadelphia, 1929, p. 132), states,
  in reference to "Sudhoff and others," that many drawings
  earlier than those of al-Zahrāwī have been discovered in
  medieval manuscripts. However, Garrison overlooked the fact
  that al-Zahrāwī’s surgical illustrations were mainly
  depicted for instructional purposes--a unique approach. It
  should be noted also that al-Zahrāwī died almost a century
  earlier than Garrison thought. See also Martin S. Spink,
  "Arabian Gynaecological, Obstetrical and Genito-Urinary
  Practice Illustrated from Albucasis," _Proceedings of the
  Royal Society of Medicine_, 1937, vol. 30, p. 654.

  [7] Johannis Channing, _Albucasis de Chirurgia. Arabice et
  Latine_, Oxford, 1778, 2 vols. (hereinafter referred to as
  Channing, _Albucasis_). The text has many errors in spelling
  and grammar, but Leclerc went too far in criticizing this
  edition, which has many merits. Moreover, the surgical
  illustrations (reproduced from the Huntington and Marsh
  manuscripts of the Bodleian Library) in Channing’s edition
  are of special interest.

  [8] Lucien Leclerc, _La Chirurgie d’Abulcasis_, Paris, 1861
  (hereinafter referred to as Leclerc, _Abulcasis_). This
  excellent French version was first published in a series of
  articles in _Gazette Médicale de l’Algérie_, and seems
  influenced by Channing’s edition more than Leclerc admits.
  Leclerc consulted several Arabic copies of the treatise as
  well as Latin and vernacular translations, but only a few of
  these Arabic manuscripts are considered complete. The Arabic
  manuscripts studied for the present article are not the same
  as those used by Leclerc. See also Leclerc’s monumental
  work, _Histoire de la Médecine Arabe_, Paris, 1876, vol. 1,
  pp. 453-457.

  [9] Ernst Gurlt, _Geschichte der Chirurgie und ihrer
  Ausübung Volkschirurgie-Alterthum-Mittelalter-Renaissance_,
  Berlin, 1898, vol. 1, pp. 620-649, with more than 100
  figures. In the text and illustrations, Gurlt relied upon
  Leclerc’s translation and modified drawings of the surgical
  instruments; nevertheless, he presents a brief, systematic
  study--probably the best so far--of the entire treatise.

  [10] Karl Sudhoff, _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Chirurgie im
  Mittelalter_, Leipzig, 1918 (hereinafter referred to as
  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_), vol. 2, pp. 16-84, with a few plates.
  Although Sudhoff consulted the fragmentary Arabic manuscript
  indexed as "Cod. Arab. 1989" in Gotha, Germany, he relied
  mainly upon Latin versions of the treatise and the
  illustrations contained in them.

  [11] See Leclerc, _Abulcasis_, in introduction.

  [12] The seven Arabic manuscripts are indexed as "Berlin MS.
  Or. fol. 91," temporarily at Universitätsbibliothek
  Tübingen, in Germany; "Escorial MS. Arabe No. 876," at
  Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo el Real de El
  Escorial, in Spain; "Wien MS. Cod. N.F. 476 A.," at
  Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek, in Vienna; and "Ali
  Emiri Arabi No. 2854," "Beşir Ağa Nos. 502 and 503," and
  "Veliyyudin No. 2491," all at Süleymaniye Umumi Kütüphanesi
  Müdürlüğü, in Istanbul. Hereinafter these manuscripts are
  referred to, respectively, as Tüb. MS. 91; Esc. 876; Wien
  476 A; Ali 2854; Bes. 502; Bes. 503; and Vel. 2491. The
  Smithsonian Institution recently obtained a microfilm copy
  of Bankipore Manuscript No. 17 from the Khuda Bakhsh O. P.
  Library, Patna (Bihar), India. This manuscript, containing
  only the 30th treatise of _al-Taṣrīf_, was copied in 1189;
  therefore, it is the earliest dated Arabic manuscript of the
  surgical treatise known to exist. The surgical illustrations
  therein add weight to the belief that the Arabic manuscripts
  show more originality in the drawings than do the later
  copied versions, which often were inaccurate and possibly
  distorted. About ten other illustrations from the Arabic
  manuscript in Istanbul indexed as "Topkapi MS. No. 1990"
  (which contains 215 beautifully illustrated figures) were
  presented by A. S. Ünver and Hüseyin Usman in an extract
  titled "Meşhur Arab Cerrahi Elbülkasimi Zehravi ve onum
  Kitabül Cerrahiyesi," Istanbul, 1935. See also Ünver,
  _Şerefeddin Sabuncuoğlu: Kitabül Cerrahiyei Illhaniye_,
  Istanbul, 1939, pp. [5]-7.

  [13] See introduction to the treatise; for example, Bes.
  502, fol. 522v-523v and Vel. 2491, fol. 104r-105v. See also
  K. P. J. Sprengel, _Versuch einer pragmatischen Geschichte
  der Arzneikunde_, Halle, 1823, vol. 2, pp. 449-451. George
  J. Fisher, in "Abul-Casem Chalaf Ibn Abbas al-Zahrāwī,
  Commonly Called Albucasis," _Annals of Anatomy and Surgery_,
  July-December, 1883, vol. 8, pp. 24-25, gives a translation
  of only the first part of the introduction.

  [14] There are 56 chapters listed in almost all manuscripts
  and commentary works I checked except Tüb. MS. 91 and Esc.
  876, where only 55 chapters are listed.

  [15] Al-Zahrāwī mentions several caustic medicines used in
  cautery, among which are garlic, mustard, melted lead,
  slaked or unslaked lime with or without "common" soap,
  Thapsia (_Ruta graveolens_ Linn.), and juice of the Oriental
  cashew nut (_Senecarpus anacardium_ Linn.).

  [16] Vel. 2491, fol. 106; Bes. 502, fol. 523r-524v.

  [17] Al-Zahrāwī criticizes those who interpret the saying
  "cautery is the end of treatment" to mean that cauterization
  is the best and only conclusive treatment at the physician’s
  disposal. He points out that other treatments, such as
  drugs, should be resorted to first, and used until they
  prove of no avail; and he states that only after cautery
  proves to be the cure should it be considered the completion
  of medical treatment--"al-kay ākhir al-ṭibb." See Vel. 2491,
  fol. 106; and Bes. 502, fol. 524r-525v.

  [18] For healing, soothing, or emollient purposes,
  al-Zahwārī suggested medications, such as egg white, salt
  water (normal saline), sap of psyllium, several ointments,
  "duhn" of rose, and other "adhān" (plural of "duhn," the
  fatty or oily essences extracted from various substances
  through pharmaceutical processes).

  [19] For a more accurate estimate of the equivalence of
  "dirham" according to the area in which the measurement was
  taken, the reader may consult Walter Hinz, _Islamische Masse
  und Gewichte umgerechnet ins metrische System_, Leiden,
  1955, pt. 1, pp. 2-8; and George C. Miles, _Early Arabic
  Glass Weights and Stamps_, New York, 1948, p. 6.

  [20] The contents of several manuscripts (such as Ali 2854,
  Wien 476 A, Bes. 503, and Tüb. MS. 91) give different
  numbers.

  [21] See, for example, Tüb. MS. 91, fol. 45v; and Bes. 502,
  fol. 530v.

  [24] It is regrettable that Franz Rosenthal in his fine
  article "Bibliographical Notes on Medieval Muslim Dentistry"
  (_Bulletin of the History of Medicine_, 1960, vol. 34, pp.

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
