PREFACE.


This book is offered to the public, not to be classed with elaborate or
learned works, nor expected, like some of its more pretending companions
among the offspring of the press, to run the gauntlet of literary
criticism. It was prepared to meet the wants of persons--numbered by
_multitudes_ in even the most intelligent and refined communities--who
from deficiency of education, or from carelessness of manner, are in the
habit of misusing many of the most common words of the English language,
distorting its grammatical forms, destroying its beauty, and corrupting
its purity. The most thorough mode that could be adopted to correct such
errors, would doubtless be to impart to the ignorant a practical knowledge
of the principles of language, as embodied in treatises on grammar; but
such a good work, however desirable its results, has, in time past, been
too difficult for the promoters of education to complete, and is still too
great to give promise of speedy accomplishment. A better expedient,
bearing immediate fruits, has been adopted in the present volume, which,
while it does not aim to produce a radical reform, cannot fail to render
great service to those who need to improve their usual modes of
expression, and to be more discriminating in their choice of words.

The more frequent and less excusable mistakes that may be noticed in
ordinary conversation or correspondence, are here taken up, one by
one--exposed, explained, and corrected. They consist variously of abuses
of grammar, misapplications of words and phrases, improprieties of
metaphor and comparison, misstatements of meaning, and faults of
pronunciation. They are grouped miscellaneously, _without classification_,
not so much because of the difficulty of devising an arrangement that
would be systematic and intelligible, as from the evident fact that a
division of subjects would render no assistance to those for whom the book
is specially designed; for an appropriate classification would necessarily
derive its features from the forms of grammar, and with these the readers
of this book are supposed to be to a great extent unfamiliar.

The volume is put forth with no flourish of trumpets, and makes no
extravagant pretensions; yet the publishers believe it will be regarded as
a timely and useful work. If the race of _critics_ should not like it--and
while books have their "faults," critics have their "failings"--they are
reminded that he who corrects an old error, may render no less service to
his brethren, than he who discovers a new truth. If the work shall be the
means of saving one sensitive man from a confusion of blushes, in the
presence of a company before which he desired to preserve his equanimity,
it will not have gone forth without a mission of benefit, which will merit
at least one acknowledgment.




INTRODUCTION.


The aim of this book, by correcting a multitude of common errors in the
use of language, is mainly to offer assistance to such persons as need
greater facilities for accurate expression _in ordinary conversation_. It
is not designed to suggest topics of talk, nor to give rules or examples
pointing out the proper modes of arranging them; but simply to insure
persons who often have a good thing to say, from the confusion and
mortification of improperly saying it. This chapter of introduction will
not, therefore, be expected to present an essay on the general subject of
conversation.

It may be remarked, however, by way of admonitory hint to some, that the
most prominent error in the conversation of those who commit the most
blunders, does not consist in saying too little that amounts to much, but
too much that amounts to little; talkativeness is a characteristic more
commonly of the ignorant, than of the wise. Shenstone says, "The common
fluency of speech in many men, and most women, is owing to a scarcity of
matter and a scarcity of words; for whoever is master of a language, and
moreover has a mind full of ideas, will be apt, in speaking, to hesitate
upon the choice of both; but common speakers have only one set of ideas
and one set of words to clothe them in,--and these are always ready at the
mouth. Just so, _people can come faster out of a church when it is almost
empty, than when a crowd is at the door_!" But although, according to the
old proverb, "a still tongue denotes a wise head," the faculty of speech
should not be neglected, merely because it may be misused.

Conversation is not a gift bestowed only upon those whom genius favors; on
the contrary, many men eminent for their fluency of style in writing, have
been noted for habitual taciturnity in their intercourse with society.
Hazlitt remarked, that "authors should be read, not heard!" Charles II. of
England, not only the wittiest of monarchs, but one of the liveliest of
men, is said to have been so charmed in reading the humor of Butler's
"Hudibras," that he disguised himself as a private gentleman, and was
introduced to the author, whom, to his astonishment, he found to be one of
the _dullest_ of companions. On the other hand, some of the humblest men
with whom one falls into company, possessed of but little variety, and
less extent of information, are highly entertaining talkers. The
particular topic of remark does not form so essential a part of an
interesting conversation, as the words and manner of those who engage in
it. Robert Burns, sitting down on one occasion to write a poem, said:

  "Which way the subject theme may gang,
    Let time or chance determine;
  Perhaps it may turn out a sang,--
    Or probably a sermon."

In the same manner, the subject of a conversation need not be made a
matter of study, or special preparation. Men may talk of things momentous
or trivial, and in either strain be alike attractive and agreeable.

But quitting the consideration of the thought, to refer to the mode of its
expression, it must be remarked and insisted, that to "murder the king's
English" is hardly less a crime, than to design against one of the king's
subjects. If committed from ignorance, the fault is at least deplorable;
but if from carelessness, it is inexcusable. The greatest of sciences is
that of language; the greatest of human arts is that of using words. No
"cunning hand" of the artificer can contrive a work of mechanism that is
to be compared, for a moment, with those wonderful masterpieces of
ingenuity, which may be wrought by him who can skilfully mould a beautiful
thought into a form that shall preserve, yet radiate its beauty. A mosaic
of words may be made more fair, than of inlaid precious stones. The
scholar who comes forth from his study, a master of the English language,
is a workman who has at his command hardly less than a hundred thousand
finely-tempered instruments, with which he may fashion the most cunning
device. This is a trade which all should learn, for it is one that every
individual is called to practise. The greatest support of virtue in a
community is intelligence; intelligence is the outgrowth of knowledge; and
the almoner of all knowledge is language. The possession, therefore, of
the resources, and a command over the appliances of language, is of the
utmost importance to every individual. Words are current coins of the
realm, and they who do not have them in their treasury, suffer a more
pitiable poverty than others who have not a penny of baser specie in their
pocket; and the multitude of those who have an unfailing supply, but which
is of the wrong stamp, are possessed only of counterfeit cash, that will
not pass in circles of respectability. The present work therefore is, in
some respects, not unlike the "Detector" issued for the merchants, to
indicate the great amount of worthless money that is in general
circulation with the good.

It is not to be supposed that all the mistakes of daily occurrence in the
use of language, are to be numbered by "five hundred"--possibly not by
five thousand; but it is evident that he who is instructed against five
hundred of his habitual blunders, and enabled to steer clear of every one
of them, has in no slight degree improved his conversation, and thereby
increased his importance. As a prefix, or accompaniment, to this catalogue
of corrected mistakes, the presentation of a few rules or principles of
language, which, strictly observed, might guard against numerous general
classes of errors, would not be thought misplaced, or undesirable. Some
suggestions on points most prominent are accordingly given among these
introductory remarks--not in formal statements of grammatical rules, but
in examples in which the spirit of such rules is revealed.

Not the least glaring among the many misuses of words and forms of
expression in conversation, occur by incorrectly employing the
pronouns--_who_, _which_, _what_, and _that_. It may be remarked, that
_who_ should be applied exclusively to persons. _Which_ usually refers to
animals and inanimate objects, except in such an expression as, "Tell me
_which_ of the two men was chosen?" _What_, means _that which_: thus,
"This is the book _what_ I wanted," should read, "This is the book _that_
(or _which_) I wanted."

Among interrogatives, _who?_ inquires for the name; _which?_ for the
individual; _what?_ for the character, or occupation. Thus, "_Who_ built
the bridge?" "Mr. Blake." "_Which_ of the Blakes?" "_Charles_ Blake."
"_What_ was he?" "A distinguished civil engineer."

The title of a small book for young people, recently published, was--"The
Way _that_ Little Children enter Heaven:" the word _that_ is here
incorrectly used as a substitute for _in which_, or _by which_.

When _this_ and _that_, and their plurals, are used in the sense of
_latter_ and _former_, _this_ and _these_ signify the _latter_, and _that_
and _those_ the _former_. Thus, in the following couplet from Burns:

  "Farewell my friends, farewell my foes,
  My peace with _these_, my love with _those_."

_these_ refers to "foes," and _those_ to "friends."

In the possessive case of nouns, some instances occur in which a wise
choice may be made, but in respect to which usage is divided. Thus, we may
say, "They called at _Walton's the bookseller's_," or, with equal
propriety, as far as custom is concerned, "at _Walton the bookseller's_."
The first form, however, is preferable.

The use of the hyphen [-] is frequently disregarded in epistolary
correspondence, occasioning not only a blemish but a blunder. Its
importance may be seen by comparing the meaning of "_glass house_" with
"_glass-house_;" the former may mean the Crystal Palace, while the latter
is a manufactory of glass-ware.

Adjectives are often improperly used for adverbs: as, "_extreme_ bad
weather," for "_extremely_ bad weather."

It is sometimes difficult to choose between such phrases as "the _first
three_," and "the _three first_." To say _first three_ when there is no
_second three_ is inelegant, because superfluous; and _three first_ is
absurd, because impossible. The most successful pupil in each of two
classes at school would not improperly be called "the _two first boys_;"
while propriety would require that the first and second boys of the same
class should be called "the _first two boys_." As a general rule, and easy
to be recollected, let _"first" be first_.

The use of _some_ for _about_ is by many writers thought to be awkward:
as, "_Some_ fifty years ago," instead of "_About_ Fifty years."

An ambiguity occasionally arises in employing the adjective _no_. Thus,
"No money is better than gold," may mean either that gold is the best kind
of money, or that gold is not so good as _no money at all_!

After numerals, the words _couple_, _pair_, _dozen_, _score_, _hundred_,
_thousand_, and a few others, need not take the plural form: thus, custom
first, and finally grammar, have sanctioned such uses as, "three _pair_ of
shoes," "nine _dozen_ bushels," "four _couple_ of students;" also, "_forty
sail_ of vessels," "seventy _head_ of cattle."

The article (_a_ or _an_) renders an important service in such expressions
as, "_A few_ followed their leader throughout the long struggle." To say,
"_Few_ followed him," would imply, unlike the former phrase, that he was
almost deserted.

"A black and a white horse," suggests the idea of two horses; while "a
black and white horse," refers to but one--as if written "a
_black-and-white_ horse."

"The red and white dahlias were most admired," properly means the dahlias
in which both these colors were blended. "The red and _the_ white
dahlias," implies two species.

The grammatical number of a verb should agree with that of its subject,
and not of its predicate. Thus, the sentences, "Death _is_ the wages of
sin," and "The wages of sin _are_ death," are properly written.

In changing from a past tense to the present, when the same nominative
remains, the form of the verb should continue unaltered. Thus, instead of
saying "He _was traveling_ and _travels_," say "He _was traveling_ and _is
traveling_."

When a verb has both a singular and a plural nominative, separated by
_or_, its number agrees with that of the _nearer_: as, "the cup or his
_billiards were_ his ruin;" or, "his billiards or the _cup was_ his ruin."

Custom--which, when _crystallized_, becomes grammar--allows expressions
like "The linen _tears_," and "The meadow _plows_ well," although they
should not be frequently employed, and should be more seldom coined.

A fruitful source of mistakes in language, is in the linking together of
two or more inappropriate tenses, or in the misuse of one. Many among the
learned and refined commit blunders of these kinds. A few corrected
examples of such are here given:

"His text was, that God _was_ love;" the sentence should be written, "His
text was, that God _is_ love."

"The Lord _hath given_, and the Lord hath taken away;" say, "The Lord
_gave_, and the Lord hath taken away."

"They _arrived_ before we left the city:" say, "they _had arrived_."

"All the brothers _have been_ greatly indebted to their father:" say,
"_are indebted_."

"This painting _was preserved and exhibited_ for the last century:" say,
"_has been_ preserved and exhibited."

"It was the last act he intended _to have performed_." say, "_to
perform_."

"He _drinks_ wine at dinner," means that such is his habit; "he _is
drinking_ wine at dinner," refers to one particular time and occasion.

Adverbs are often inelegantly used instead of adjectives; as, "the _then_
ministry," for "the ministry of that time."

Of the phrases "_never_ so good," or, "_ever_ so good," as to whether one
is preferable to the other, authority is divided. Modern usage inclines to
the latter, while ancient preferred the former, as in the Scriptural
expression, "charm he _never_ so wisely."

_Yea_ and _nay_ are not equivalent to _yes_ and _no_; the latter are
directly affirmative and negative, while the former are variously
employed.

Of prepositions, it has been frequently said, that no words in the
language are so liable to be incorrectly used. For example, "The love _of_
God," may mean either "His love to us," or, "our love to Him."

Many more of these particles are inelegantly, if not ambiguously used.
Instead of "the natives were a different race _to_ what they are now,"
say, "different _from_."

"He was made much _on_ in the country:" say, "made much _of_."

"In compliance _of_ your request:" say, "in compliance _with_."

"He doubts _if_ his friend will come," is not so elegant and accurate as,
"He doubts _whether_ his friend will come."

More instances might be given, setting forth other frequent errors of
speaking and writing, at the risk, however, of destroying the due
proportion which should exist between the size of a work and the _length
of the Introduction_. But a good heed to what has been said in the few
preceding paragraphs, will enable a person who carefully reads this work
to mend his modes of expression, to no inconsiderable degree. It is well
known that there is no "royal road to learning," but if there were, it
could hardly be expected that such a little book as this would afford a
passport to the end of the course. About two hundred years ago, a small
volume was put forth by one "John Peters, learned scholar and author,"
which had the following long-winded title: "A New Way to make Latin
Verses, whereby any one of ordinary capacity, that only _knows the A, B,
C_ and can _count nine_, though he understands not _one word of Latin_, or
what a verse means, may be plainly taught to make thousands of Hexameter
and Pentameter Verses, which shall be true Latin, true Verse, and Good
Sense!" The present volume must not be expected to accomplish so great a
result as this--not having so comprehensive an aim, nor possessing so
great a secret of success. But it is hoped that it may incite some who are
unfortunately deficient in education, to seek so much additional knowledge
as shall enable them at least to converse in a dialect which is within the
compass of the language of their country, and free them from the
imputation of belonging to another tribe of men, speaking another tongue.

A Welshman, residing near Caermarthon, who was seldom seen at the only
church in the parish of his residence, was one day accosted by the worthy
clergyman with the question, "My friend--to what church do you belong?" He
responded, "To the Church of England." "Ah," replied the pastor, "I was
sure that it must be some church _out of Wales_!" There are not a few
persons who speak the English language about as truly as the Caermarthon
Welshman attended the English Church!




FIVE HUNDRED MISTAKES CORRECTED.


1. "The business would suit any one who _enjoys bad health_." [From an
advertisement in a daily newspaper of New-York.] Few persons who have bad
health can be said to _enjoy it_. Use some other form of expression: as,
one _in delicate health_, or, one _whose health is bad_.

2. "We have no _corporeal_ punishment here," said a schoolmaster.
_Corporeal_ is opposed to _spiritual_. Say, _corporal_ punishment.
_Corporeal_ means having a body.

3. "She is a _notable_ woman," as was said of the wife of the Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain,--meaning _careful_, and pronounced as though divided
_not-able_. This word is no longer current, with this pronunciation or
signification, except to a slight extent in England. It has become
obsolete, and its use now is in bad taste.

4. "Insert the _advertisement_ in the Weekly." Emphasize _vert_, and not
_ise_.

5. "He _rose up_, and left the room:" leave out _up_, as it is absurd to
say _rise down_. The Irishman who was _hoisted down_ the coal pit, did not
observe this rule.

6. "_Set down_ and rest yourself:" say _sit down_; _setting_ is said of
the sun in the west, but cannot be properly applied to a person taking a
seat. "Sit _down_" is not improper, though "rise _up_" (as in No. 5)
should never be used. _Sitting down_ expresses the act of appropriating a
chair, while _sitting up_ means _sitting erect_. _Sitting up_ also refers
to watching during the night with the sick.

7. "You have _sown_ it very neatly," said a seamstress to her apprentice:
say _sewed_, and pronounce so as to rhyme with _road_. The pronunciation
of _sew_, meaning "to use the needle," violates its spelling; it is the
same as that of _sow_, meaning "to scatter seed."

8. "This is a secret between _you and I_:" say, _you and me_. The
construction requires the objective case in place of _I_, which is in the
nominative. It is in still better taste to say, "This is a secret _with_
you and me."

9. "Let _you and I_ take a walk:" say, Let _you and me_, or, _Let us_. Who
would think of saying, _Let I go_? The expression "Let _I and you_" is
frequently heard, which contains the additional impropriety of putting the
first person before the second.

10. "He is going to _learn his brother_ Alfred how to knit nets:" say,
_teach_. The act of _communicating_ instruction is expressed by
"teaching," the act of _receiving_ it by "learning." The distinction
between these words was made as early as the time of Shakespeare, and
cannot be violated without incurring censure.

11. "John and Henry both read well, but John is the _best_ reader:" say,
the _better_ reader, as _best_ can be properly used only when _three or
more persons_, or objects, are compared.

12. "Thompson was there _among the rest_." This mode of expression, which
is very common, literally declares an impossibility. The signification of
"the rest" is, those _in addition_ to Thompson, and of which Thompson
formed _no part_; he could not therefore be _among_ them. A more correct
form would be, "Thompson was there _with_ the rest."

13. "The _two first_ cows are the fattest," said a farmer at an
agricultural fair. He should have said, "the _first two_;" there can be
only _one_ that is _first_--the other must necessarily be _second_.

14. "It is an error; _you are mistaken_:" say, you _mistake_. _Mistaken_
means _misapprehended_; "you _mistake_," means "you _misapprehend_."

15. "Have you _lit_ the fire, Bridget?" say, _lighted_; _lit_ is now
obsolete.

16. "To be is an _auxiliary_ verb:" pronounce _auxiliary_ as though
spelled _awg-zil-ya-re_, and not in five syllables.

17. _February_: this word is often incorrectly spelled by omitting the
_r_.

18. The "_Miscellany_" was an interesting publication: pronounce
_miscellany_ with the accent on _mis_, and not on _cel_.

19. "_Celery_ is a pleasant vegetable:" pronounce _celery_ as it is
written, and not _salary_.

20. "Are you at _leisure_?" pronounce _lei_ in _leisure_ the same as
_lee_. The word should not rhyme with _measure_.

21. "John is my _oldest_ brother:" say, _eldest_. _Elder and eldest_ are
applied to _persons_--_older and oldest_ to _things_. Usage, however, does
not make these distinctions imperative.

22. "The cloth was _wove_ in a very short time:" say, _woven_.

23. "I prefer the _yolk_ of an egg to the white:" the more common word is
_yelk_, with the _l_ sounded; but if _yolk_ be used, it should be
pronounced like _yoke_.

24. _Sparrowgrass_: it is only the grossest ignorance which confounds this
word with _asparagus_. The same is the case with _ing-uns_ for _onions_. A
man in an obscure section of New Jersey, inquiring at a country store for
_onions_, was told that there were none in the place. On his going out,
the storekeeper turned to half a dozen idlers sitting round the stove, and
said, "I wonder if that 'tarnal fool meant _ing-uns_!"

25. "You are very _mischievous_:" pronounce _mischievous_ with the accent
on _mis_, and not on _chie_, and do not say _mischievious_
(_mis-cheev-yus_).

26. The following words were posted, as a sign, in a reading-room--"No
Talking Allowed;" which was designed to prohibit all conversation. A wag
altered the inscription so as to read, "No Talking Aloud," which (he
declared) did not prevent _whispering_, and chatting in _low tones_. What
shall be said of the following--"_No Smoking Aloud_?"

27. "_No extras or vacations_:" [from the prospectus of a schoolmistress:]
say, NOR _vacations_.

28. "He was never known to be _covetous_:" pronounce _covetous_ as if
written _covet us_, and _not covetyus_.

29. _The Three R.'s._--An ignorant and vain pedagogue, on being asked what
he could teach, replied, "The three R.'s--_'ritin'_, _'rethmetic_, and
_readin'_." Any persons among the readers of this little book, who may
chance to be schoolmasters, are warned against giving such a course of
instruction.

30. "Dearly _beloved_ brethren:" when _beloved_ is placed _before_ the
noun, as in this instance, pronounce it in three syllables; when placed
_after_, in two syllables, as, "She was much _be-loved_ by us all." When
used as a noun by itself, it is pronounced in three syllables; as,
"_Be-lov-ed_, let us love one another."

31. "Not _as I know_:" say, _that I know_.

32. "He came on purpose _for to do_ it:" omit _for_.

33. "He would never believe _but what_ I did it:" say, _but that_ I did
it.

34. "He is quite _as good as me_:" say, _as good as I_. Also, instead of
_as good as him_, say, _as good as he_. In both these instances _am_ or
_is_ must be mentally supplied at the end of the phrase, to suggest the
meaning; and the pronouns should, therefore, be in the nominative case.

35. "_Many an one_ has done the same:" say, _many a one_. _A_, and _not
an_, is also used before the _long sound of u_, that is, when _u_ forms _a
distinct syllable of itself_: as, _a unit_, _a union_, _a university_: it
is also used before _eu_: as, a _euphony_, and likewise before the word
_ewe_: as, _a ewe_: we should also say, _a youth_, not _an youth_.

36. "How do you like _these kind_ of pears?" say, _these kinds_; a noun in
the singular number will not allow its adjective to be in the plural.

37. "You should have _went_ home:" say, _gone_.

38. "John went with _James and I_:" say, _James and me_.

39. "I _see him_ last Monday:" say, _saw him_.

40. "He was _averse from_ such a proceeding:" say, _averse to_.

41. "Have you _shook_ the table-cloth?" say, _shaken_.

42. "I have _rang_ several times:" say, _rung_.

43. "I _know'd_ him at once:" say, _knew_.

44. "You have _drank_ too much of it:" say, _drunk_.

45. "He has _chose_ a very poor pattern:" say, _chosen_.

46. "They have _broke_ a window:" say, _broken_.

47. "I have just _began_ my letter:" say, _begun_.

48. "Give me _them books_:" say, _those books_.

49. "Whose are _these here books_?" say, _these books_. _Here_ is
superfluous and inelegant.

50. "_Who_ do you mean?" say, _whom_.

51. "The men _which_ we saw:" say, _whom_.

52. "The flowers _what_ you have:" say, _which_, or _that_.

53. "The boy _as is_ reading:" _who_ is reading.

54. "It was _them_ who did it:" say, _they_.

55. "_It is me_ who am in fault:" say, _It is I_.

56. "Was it _her_ who called me?" say, _she_.

57. "If I were _her_, I would accept his offer:" say, If I were _she_.

58. "He _has got_ my slate:" omit _got_; _has_ is sufficient for the
sense. The addition of _got_, though not ungrammatical, but gradually
becoming obsolete, does not in any degree strengthen the meaning.

59. "The pond is _froze_:" say, _frozen_.

60. "I know _I am him_ whom he meant:" say, _I am he_.

61. "You cannot _catch_ him:" pronounce _catch_ so as to rhyme with
_match_, and not _ketch_--as the fishermen are in the habit of saying.

62. "_Who done it?_" say, _Who did it?_

63. "The club gives an _impetus_ to the ball:" pronounce _impetus_ with
the stress on _im_, and not on _pe_.

64. "Spain and Portugal form a _peninsula_:" pronounce _pen-in-su-la_,
with the accent on _in_, and not on _su_.

65. _Sar-da-na-pa-lus_: pronounce it with the accent on _pa_, and not on
_ap_. The latter pronunciation cannot be changed for the former, without
incurring a gross error.

66. "He must by this time be almost as far as the _antipodes_:" pronounce
_antipodes_ with the accent on _tip_, and let _des_ rhyme with _ease_; it
is a word of _four_ syllables, and _not of three_.

67. _Vouchsafe_: a word seldom used, but when used, the first syllable
should rhyme with _pouch_; _never say vousafe_.

68. "The land in those parts is very _fertile_:" pronounce _fertile_ so as
to rhyme with _myrtle_. _Ile_ in such words must be sounded as _ill_, with
the exception of _exile_, _senile_, _gentile_, _reconcile_, and
_camomile_, in which _ile_ rhymes with _mile_.

69. _Benefited_: often spelt _benefitted_, but _incorrectly_.

70. "_Gather_ a few ears of corn for dinner:" pronounce _gather_ so as to
rhyme with _lather_, and _not gether_.

71. _Purpose and propose_: these two words, which are often confounded,
are entirely distinct in meaning. To _purpose_ means _to intend_; _to
propose_ means _to offer a proposition_.

72. _Directing and addressing letters_: _Directing_ designates the persons
to whom, and the place to which the letter, as a parcel, is to be sent;
_addressing_ refers to the individual to whom, as a communication, it is
written. A letter _addressed_ to the President, may be _directed_ to his
secretary.

73. "_Who_ do you think I saw yesterday?" say, _Whom_.

74. A popular proverb is expressed in the following language: "Of _two_
evils choose the _least_;" say, _the less_. Of no less than _three_ evils
can a person choose the _least_.

75. _Exaggerate_: pronounce _exad-gerate_, and _do not sound agger_ as in
_dagger_.

76. _Ladies School_: the _usual_ form, but _not correct_; write, _Ladies'
School_. The apostrophe (') is thus used after nouns in the plural, and
indicates _possession_. In the singular, it is placed _before the s_, as,
_The lady's school_.

77. The following equivocal notice is said to swing out on a sign-board
somewhere in the Western country: "SMITH & HUGGS--SELECT SCHOOL.--_Smith
teaches the boys, and Huggs the girls._" _Huggs needs correction!_

78. "He keeps a _chaise_:" pronounce it _shaze_, and not _shay_; it has a
regular plural, _chaises_.

79. "The _drought_ lasted a long time:" pronounce _drought_ so as to rhyme
with _sprout_, and not _drowth_.

80. "The two friends _conversed together_ for an hour:" omit _together_,
as the full meaning of this word is implied in _con_, which means _with_,
or _together_, or _in company_.

81. "The affair was _compromised_:" pronounce _compromised_ in three
syllables, and place the accent on _com_, sounding _mised_ like _prized_.

82. "A _steam-engine_:" pronounce _engine_ with _en_ as in _pen_, and _not
like in_; also, pronounce _gine_ like _gin_.

83. "Several of the trappers were massacred by the Indians:" pronounce
_massacred_ with the accent on _mas_, and _red_ like _erd_, as if
_massaker'd_; never say _massacreed_, which is abominable.

84. "The King of Israel and the King of Judah sat _either of them_ on his
throne:" say, _each of them_. _Either_ signifies the _one_ or the _other_,
but _not both_. _Each_ relates to _two or more objects_, and signifies
_both of the two_, or _every one of any number taken singly_. We can say,
"_either_ of the three," for "_one_ of the three."

85. "A _respite_ was granted the convict:" pronounce _respite_ with the
accent on _res_, and sound _pite_ as _pit_.

86. "He soon _returned back_:" leave out _back_, which is implied by _re_
in _returned_.

87. "The ship looked like a speck on the edge of the _horizon_:" pronounce
_horizon_ with the accent on _ri_, and not on _hor_, which is often the
case.

88. "They were early at the _sepulchre_:" pronounce _sepulchre_ with the
accent on _sep_, and not on the second syllable.

89. "I have often _swam_ across the Hudson:" say, _swum_.

90. "I found my friend better than I expected _to have found him_:" say,
_to find him_.

91. "I intended _to have written_ a letter yesterday:" say, _to write_; as
however long it now is since I thought of writing, "_to write_" was then
present to me, and must still be considered as present, when I recall that
time and the thoughts of it.

92. _Superfluous R's_: Many persons pronounce words which have no letter
_r_ in them, exactly as though they had; as _drawring_ for _drawing_; "I
_sawr_ Thomas," for "I _saw_," &c. Some who do not insert a full-toned
_r_, do worse by appending an _ah_ to almost every word they utter. They
would do well to recall the reproof which the excellent Rev. John Gruber
administered to a brother in the ministry, who was guilty of this habit.
That eccentric clergyman addressed a note to his friend, as follows:
"Dear-ah Sir-ah--When-ah you-ah speak-ah in-ah public-ah, take-ah my-ah
ad-ah-vice-ah and-ah never-ah say-ah _ah-ah_!--JOHN-AH GRUBER-AH."

93. _Shall_ and _will_ are often confounded, or misused. The following
suggestion will be of service to the reader: mere _futurity_ is expressed
by _shall_ in the _first_ person, and by _will_ in the _second_ and
_third_; the _determination_ of the speaker by _will_, in the _first_, and
_shall_, in the _second_ and _third_. For example: "_I shall go by the way
of Halifax_," simply expresses an event about to take place--as also _you
will_, and _they will_: _I will_ expresses determination--as also _you
shall_ and _they shall_. Brightland has the following illustrative stanza:

  "In the first person simply _shall_ foretells;
  In _will_ a threat, or else a promise, dwells.
  _Shall_, in the second and the third, does threat;--
  _Will_, simply, then, foretells the future feat."

94. "_Without_ the grammatical form of a word can be recognized at a
glance, little progress can be made in reading the language:" [from a work
on the study of the Latin language:] say, _Unless_ the grammatical, &c.
The use of _without_ for _unless_ is a very common mistake.

95. "He claimed admission to the _chiefest_ offices:" say, _chief_.
_Chief_, _right_, _supreme_, _correct_, _true_, _universal_, _perfect_,
_consummate_, _extreme_, _&c._, _imply_ the superlative degree without
adding _est_, or prefixing _most_. In language sublime or impassioned,
however, the word _perfect_ requires the superlative form, to give it its
fullest effect.

96. "I _had rather do_ it now:" say, I _would rather do_. The
incorrectness of the first form of expression is very clearly seen by
cutting out _rather_, leaving "_I had do_," which is ungrammatical and
meaningless.

97. An obituary notice contained the following ludicrous statement: "He
left a large circle of mourners, _embracing his amiable wife and
children_!" _Comprising_ should have been used, instead of _embracing_.

98. "His _court-of-arms_ is very splendid:" say, _coat-of-arms_.

99. "They ride about in small carriages, which are called _flies_:" write
the last word _flys_; _flies_ is the plural of _fly_, the insect.

100. "Victoria is Queen of the _United Kingdom_:" say, _United Kingdoms_.
Who ever speaks of the _United State of America_?

101. "I have not traveled _this twenty years_:" say, _these twenty years_.

102. "Soldier arms!" Say, "_Shoulder arms!_" The latter is frequently
corrupted into "_Sojer arms!_"

103. "He is _very much the gentleman_:" say, He is _a very gentlemanly
man_, or, _He is very gentlemanly_.

104. "The _yellow_ part of an egg is very nourishing:" never pronounce
_yellow_ so as to rhyme with _tallow_, as we so often hear.

105. "We are going to the _Zoological_ Gardens:" pronounce _Zoological_ in
_five_ syllables, and place the accent on _log_ in _logical_; sound _log_
like _lodge_, and _the first two o's in distinct syllables_; _never_ make
_Zool one_ syllable.

106. "He _strived_ to obtain an appointment:" say, _strove_.

107. "He always preaches _extempore_:" pronounce _extempore in four
syllables_, with the accent on _tem_, and _never in three_, making _pore_
to rhyme with _sore_--but with _story_.

108. "Allow me to _suggest_:" pronounce _sug_ as to rhyme with _mug_, and
_gest_ like _jest_; never say _sudjest_.

109. "That building is an _episcopal_ chapel:" pronounce _episcopal_ with
the accent on the second syllable, and _not_ on _co_.

110. "The Emperor of Russia is a _formidable_ sovereign:" pronounce
_formidable_ with the accent on _for_, and _not on mid_.

111. Before the words _heir_, _herb_, _honest_, _honor_, and _hour_, and
their compounds, instead of the article _a_, we make use of _an_, as the
_h_ is not sounded; likewise before words beginning with _h_, that are not
accented on the first syllable: such as _heroic_, _historical_,
_hypothesis_, &c., as, "_an heroic action_;" "_an historical work_;" "_an
hypothesis_ that can scarcely be allowed." The letter _h_ is seldom mute
at the beginning of a word; but from the negligence of tutors, and the
inattention of pupils, many persons have become almost incapable of
acquiring its just and full pronunciation. It is, therefore, incumbent on
teachers to be particularly careful to inculcate a clear and distinct
utterance of this sound.

112. "He was _such an extravagant young man_, that he soon spent his whole
patrimony." This construction, which is much used, is not so elegant as,
"He was _so extravagant a young man_," &c.

113. "The girl speaks _distinct_:" say, _distinctly_. _Never use
Adjectives as Adverbs._

114. "The accident of which he was _reading_, occurred not far from
_Reading_:" pronounced the first italicized word to rhyme with _feeding_,
and the other, with _wedding_.

115. The combination of letters _ough_ is pronounced in eight different
ways, as follows: 1. Th_ough_, in which it is pronounced _o_; 2.
Thr_ough_, pronounced _oo_; 3. Pl_ough_, _ow_; 4. S_ought_, _awe_; 5.
C_ough_, _off_; 6. R_ough_, _uff_; 7. Bor_ough_, _ugh_; 8. L_ough_, _ok_.
The following sentence, which is of doubtful authorship, affords an
example of each of these eight modes of pronunciation: "I put (1) _dough_
(6) _enough_ in the (5) _trough_ near the (3) _slough_ by the (8) _lough_,
to last the ducks that I (4) _bought_ at the (7) _borough_ (2) _through_
the day."

116. "I saw his _august_ majesty, the Emperor of Hayti, last _August_:"
pronounce the former word with the accent on _gust_; the latter, on _Au_.

117. "She is _quite the lady_:" say, She is _very lady-like in her
demeanor_.

118. "He is _seldom or ever_ out of town:" say, _seldom or never_, or,
_seldom if ever_.

119. "We _laid down_ to sleep:" say, we _lay down_, &c. We can say,
however, "we laid _him_ down to sleep."

120. It is somewhat singular, that while _tie_ and _untie_ convey meanings
directly opposite, _loose_ and _unloose_ signify precisely the same thing.
_Loose_ is the original word, and _unloose_ is a corruption; both words,
however, are now sanctioned by good usage, and may be indiscriminately
employed, without offence against propriety.

121. "It is dangerous to walk _of a_ slippery morning:" say, _on a_
slippery morning. But the expression, "_walking on a slippery morning_,"
and all others like it, of which a strictly literal interpretation will
not give the designed signification, are to be avoided. They often excite
a smile when seriousness is intended.

122. "He who makes himself famous by his eloquence, makes illustrious his
origin, let it be _never so mean_:" say, _ever so mean_. The practice of
using _never_ in such phrases was anciently in vogue, but is now becoming
obsolete. (See Introduction.)

123. "His reputation is acknowledged _through_ Europe:" say, _throughout_
Europe.

124. "The bank of the river is frequently _overflown_:" say, _overflowed_.
_Flown_ is the perfect participle of _fly, flying_; _flowed_, of _flow,
flowing_.

125. "I doubt _if this_ will ever reach you:" say, _whether this_, &c.

126. "It is not improbable _but I may_ be able to procure you a copy:"
say, _that I may_, &c.

127. "He was _exceeding kind_ to me:" say, _exceedingly kind_.

128. "I doubt not _but I shall_ be able:" say, _that I shall_.

129. "I lost _near_ twenty pounds:" say, _nearly_, or _almost_.

130. "There were not _over_ twenty persons present:" say, _more than_.
Such a use of this word is not frequent among writers of reputation. It
may, however, be less improperly employed, where the sense invests it with
more of a semblance to its literal signification: as, "This pair of
chickens will weigh _over_ seven pounds." Even in this case, it is better
to say _more than_.

131. "_Bills are requested to be paid quarterly_:" _the bills are not
requested_, but _the persons who owe them_. Say instead, _It is requested
that bills be paid quarterly_.

132. "There can be no doubt _but that_ he will succeed:" omit _but_.

133. "It was _no use asking_ him any more questions:" say, _of no use to
ask him_, or _there was no use in asking_, &c.

134. "The Americans said they _had no right_ to pay taxes." [From a Fourth
of July Oration.] They certainly _had a right_ to pay them, if they
wished. What the speaker meant was, _they were under no obligation to
pay_, or, _they were not bound to pay_.

135. "He intends to _stop_ at home for a few days:" it is more elegant to
say _stay_. If the time, however, should be very brief, _stop_ would
better express the idea; as, "We _stopped_ at Elmira about twenty
minutes."

136. "At this time, I _grew_ my own corn:" say, I _raised_. Farmers have
made this innovation against good taste; but for what reason, it is not
apparent; there seems to be no sufficient occasion for so awkward a
substitute for _raised_.

137. "Having incautiously _laid down_ on the damp grass, he caught a
severe cold:" say, _lain down_.

138. "We suffered no other inconvenience _but_ that arising from the
rain:" say, _than_ that, &c. _But_, to be properly used in this sentence,
would require the omission of _other_.

139. "Brutus and Aruns killed _one another_:" say, _each other_, which is
more proper. But many similar instances which occur in the New Testament,
as, "_Beloved, love one another_," and others no less beautiful and
cherished, have rendered this form of expression common, and almost
unexceptionable.

140. In a recently issued work on Arithmetic, the following is given: "If
for 72 cents I can buy 9 lbs. of raisins, _how much_ can I purchase for
$14 49?" say, "_what quantity_ can I," &c. Who would think of saying,
"_how much raisins?_"

141. WORDS TO BE CAREFULLY DISTINGUISHED.--Be very careful to distinguish
between _indite_ and _indict_ (the former meaning _to write_, and the
latter _to accuse_); _key_ and _quay_; _principle_ and _principal_;
_marshal_ and _martial_; _counsel_ and _council_; _counsellor_ and
_councillor_; _fort_ and _forte_; _draft_ and _draught_; _place_ and
_plaice_ (the latter being the name of a _fish_); _stake_ and _steak_;
_satire_ and _satyr_; _stationery_ and _stationary_; _ton_ and _tun_;
_levy_ and _levee_; _foment_ and _ferment_; _fomentation_ and
_fermentation_; _petition_ and _partition_; _Francis_ and _Frances_;
_dose_ and _doze_; _diverse_ and _divers_; _device_ and _devise_; _wary_
and _weary_; _salary_ and _celery_; _radish_ and _reddish_; _treble_ and
_triple_; _broach_ and _brooch_; _ingenious_ and _ingenuous_; _prophesy_
and _prophecy_ (some clergymen sounding the final syllable of the latter
word _long_, like the former); _fondling_ and _foundling_; _lightning_ and
_lightening_; _genus_ and _genius_; _desert_ and _dessert_; _currier_ and
_courier_; _pillow_ and _pillar_; _executer_ and _executor_ (the former
being the regular noun from the verb "to _execute_," and the latter a
strictly _legal_ term); _ridicule_ and _reticule_; _lineament_ and
_liniment_; _track_ and _tract_, _lickerish_ and _licorice_ (_lickerish_
signifying _dainty_, and _licorice_ being a plant, or preparation from
it); _statute_ and _statue_; _ordinance_ and _ordnance_; _lease_ and
_leash_; _recourse_ and _resource_; _straight_ and _strait_ (_straight_
meaning _direct_, and _strait_, _narrow_); _immerge_ and _emerge_; _style_
and _stile_; _compliment_ and _complement_; _bass_ and _base_;
_contagious_ and _contiguous_; _eminent_ and _imminent_; _eruption_ and
_irruption_; _precedent_ and _president_; _relic_ and _relict_.

142. "The number of _emigrants_ arriving in this country is increasing and
alarming:" say, _immigrants_. _Emigrants_ are those _going out_ from a
country; _immigrants_, those _coming into_ it.

143. "I prefer _radishes_ to _cucumbers_:" pronounce _radishes_ exactly
as spelt, and not _redishes_; also, the first syllable of _cucumber_ like
_fu_ in _fuel_, and not as if the word were spelled _cowcumber_.

144. "The _two last_ letters were dated from Calcutta:" say, the _last
two_, &c.

145. "The soil in those islands is so very thin, that little is produced
in them _beside_ cocoa-nut trees:" "_beside_ cocoa-nut trees" means
strictly _alongside_, or _by the side_, of them. _Besides_, or _except_,
should be used. _Besides_ also signifies _in addition to_: as, "I sat
_beside_ the President, and conversed with him _besides_."

146. "He could neither _read nor write_:" say, more properly, _write nor
read_. All persons who can _write_ can _read_, but not all who _read_ can
_write_. This sentence, as corrected, is much stronger than in the other
form.

147. "He was _bred and born_ among the hills of the Hudson:" say, _born
and bred_, which is the natural order.

148. "THIS HOUSE TO LET:" more properly, _to be let_.

149. _Here_, _there_, _where_, with verbs of motion, are generally better
than _hither_, _thither_, _whither_; as, "_Come here_; _Go there_."
_Hither_, _thither_, and _whither_, which were used formerly, are now
considered stiff and inelegant.

150. "_As far as I_ am able to judge, the book is well written:" say, _So
far as_, &c.

151. "It is doubtful whether he will act _fairly or no_:" say, _fairly or
not_.

152. "The _camelopard_ is the tallest of known animals:" pronounce
_camelopard_ with the accent on _mel_; never say _camel leopard_. Few
words, by being mispronounced, occasion greater blunders than this term.

153. "He ran _again_ me;" or, "I stood _again_ the hydrant:" say,
_against_. This word is frequently and inelegantly abbreviated, in
pronunciation, into _agin_.

154. "_No one_ should incur censure for being careful of _their_ good
character:" say, of _his_ (or _her_).

155. "The yacht capsized in rounding the stake-boat, and the helmsman was
_drownded_:" say, _drowned_.

156. "_Jalap_ will be of service to you:" pronounce the word as it is
spelled, never saying _jollop_.

157. The word _curiosity_, though a very common term, and one that should
be correctly pronounced by everybody, is frequently called _curosity_.

158. "He has just set out to _take a tour_:" pronounce _tour_ so as to
rhyme with _poor_. Be careful to avoid saying, _take a tower_; such a
pronunciation might suggest the Mamelon, instead of a trip of travel.

159. "The storm _is_ ceased, and the sky is clear:" say, _has_ ceased.

160. "Do you know _who_ this dog-headed cane belongs to?" say, _whom_. In
expressing in _writing_ the idea conveyed in this question, a better form
of sentence would be, "Do you know _to whom_ this belongs?" In familiar
conversation, however, the latter mode might be thought too formal and
precise.

161. "_Who_ did you wish to see?" say, _whom_.

162. "_Whom_ say ye that I am?" This is the English translation, given in
Luke ix. 20, of the question of Christ to Peter. The word _whom_ should be
_who_. Other instances of grammatical inaccuracies occur in the Bible; for
example, in the Sermon on the Mount, the Saviour says: "Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on earth, where _moth and rust doth corrupt_," &c.
"_Moth and rust_" make a plural nominative to "_doth_ corrupt," a singular
verb. The following, however, is correct: "But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where _neither moth nor rust doth corrupt_."

163. The word _chimney_ is sometimes called incorrectly _chimley_ and
_chimbley_.

164. "I was walking _towards_ home:" pronounce _towards_ so as to rhyme
with _boards_; _never_ say, _to-wards_.

165. "A _courier_ is expected from Washington:" pronounce _cou_ in
_courier_ so as to rhyme with _too_, never like _currier_; the two words
have entirely distinct significations.

166. "Let each of us mind _their_ own business:" say, _his_ own business.

167. "Who made that noise? Not _me_:" say, Not _I_.

168. "Is this or that the _best_ road?" say, the _better_ road.

169. "_Rinse_ your mouth:" pronounce _rinse_ as it is written, and never
_rense_. "_Rench your mouth_," said a fashionable dentist one day to a
patient. "You have already _wrenched it for me_," was the reply.

170. "He was tired of the dust of the town, and _flew_ to the pure air of
the country:" say, _fled_. _Flew_ is part of the verb _to fly_; _fled_, of
_to flee_.

171. "The first edition was not _as_ well printed as the present:" say,
_so_ well, &c.

172. "The Unabridged Dictionary was his greatest work, it being the labor
of a life-time:" pronounce _Dictionary_ as if written _Dik-shun-a-ry_;
not, as is too commonly the practice, _Dixonary_.

173. "I should feel sorry to be _beholding_ to him:" say, _beholden_.

174. "He is a _despicable_ fellow, and such an epitaph is strictly
_applicable_ to him:" _never_ place the accent in _despicable_ and
_applicable_ on the _second_ syllable, but _always_ on the _first_.

175. "Some disaster has certainly _befell_ him:" say, _befallen_.

176. Carefully distinguish between _sergeant_ and _serjeant_: both are
pronounced _sarjant_, but the _former_ is used in a military sense, and
the _latter_ applied to a lawyer. These distinctions are, however,
observed chiefly in England.

177. "She is a pretty _creature_:" never pronounce _creature_ like
_creetur_.

178. The following expression would be of special significance on coming
from a surgeon or anatomist: "Desiring to know your friend better, _I took
him apart_ to converse with him." It has been said that two persons who
_take each other apart_, frequently do so for the express purpose of
_putting their heads together_.

179. "I am very wet, and must go and _change myself_:" say, _change my
clothes_.

180. "He is taller _than me_:" say, _than I_.

181. "He is much better _than me_:" say, _than I_.

182. "You are stronger _than him_:" say, _than he_.

183. "That is the _moot_ point:" say, _disputed_ point. The other word is
inelegant, and nearly obsolete.

184. "They are at _loggerheads_": this is an extremely unpoetical figure
to express the mutual relations of two individuals who have an "honest
difference;" say, at _variance_, or use some other form of expression. It
might just as well be said, "They are at _tadpoles_!"

185. "He paid a _florin_ to the _florist_:" divide the syllables so as to
pronounce like _flor-in_ and _flo-rist_.

186. "His character is _undeniable_:" a very common expression: say,
_unexceptionable_.

187. "Bring me the _lantern_:" never spell _lantern_--_lanthorn_.

188. "The room is twelve _foot_ long, and nine _foot_ broad:" say, twelve
_feet_, nine _feet_.

189. "He is a _Highlander_:" never say, _Heelander_.

190. "He is _singular_, though _regular_ in his habits, and also very
_particular_:" beware of leaving out the _u_ in _singular_, _regular_, and
_particular_, which is a very common practice.

191. "They are detained _at_ France:" say, _in_ France.

192. "He lives _at_ New-York:" say, _in_ New-York.

193. "He is very _dry_" (meaning _thirsty_), is a very common and very
improper word to use: say, _thirsty_.

194. "No _less_ than fifty persons were there:" say, _fewer_, &c. _Less_
refers to _quantity_; _fewer_ to _number_.

195. "_Such another_ victory, and we shall be ruined:" say, _Another such_
victory, &c.

196. "It is _some distance_, from our house:" say, _at some distance_, &c.

197. "I shall call _upon_ him:" say, _on_ him.

198. "Remove those _trestles_:" pronounce _trestles_ exactly as written,
only leaving out the _t_; never say _trussles_.

199. "He is much addicted to _raillery_:" in pronouncing _raillery_, leave
out the _i_; never say, _rail-le-ry_.

200. "He is a Doctor of _Medicine_:" pronounce _medicine_ in _three_
syllables, NEVER in _two_.

201. "They told me to enter _in_:" leave out _in_, as it is implied in
_enter_.

202. "His _strength_ is failing:" never say, _strenth_.

203. "Give me both _of_ those books:" leave out _of_.

204. "_Whenever_ I try to write well, I _always_ find I can do it:" leave
out _always_, which is unnecessary and improper.

205. "He plunged _down_ into the stream:" leave out _down_.

206. "I never saw his _nephew_:" say, _nef-ew_; never _nev-u_, or
_nevvey_.

207. "She is the _matron_:" say, _may-tron_, and not _mat-ron_.

208. "Give me _leave_ to tell you:" never say _lief_ for _leave_.

209. "The _height_ is considerable:" pronounce _height_ so as to rhyme
with _tight_; never _hate_ nor _heighth_. An instance occurs in "Paradise
Lost" in which this word is spelled and pronounced _highth_.

210. "Who has my _scissors_?" never call _scissors_, _sithers_.

211. "He has obtained a good _situation_:" pronounce _situation_ as if
written _sit-you-a-tion_, and do not say, _sitch-u-a-tion_.

212. "I had as _lief_ do it as not:" _lief_ means _willingly_, _gladly_,
and is not to be confounded with _leave_, as in example No. 208.

213. "First _of all_ I shall give you a lesson in French, and last _of
all_ in music:" omit _of all_ in both instances, as unnecessary.

214. "I shall have finished by the _latter_ end of the week:" leave out
_latter_, which is superfluous.

215. "They sought him _throughout_ the _whole_ country:" leave out
_whole_, which is implied in _throughout_.

216. "Iron sinks _down_ in water:" leave out _down_.

217. "A warrant was _issued out_ for his apprehension:" leave out the word
_out_, which is implied in _issued_.

218. "If you inquire _for why_ I did so, I can give a very good reason:"
leave out _for_.

219. "I own that I did not come soon enough; but _because why_? I was
detained:" leave out _because_.

220. "I _cannot by no means_ allow it:" say, _I can by no means_, &c.; or,
_I cannot by any means_, &c.

221. "He _covered it over_:" leave out _over_.

222. "I bought _a new pair of shoes_:" say, _a pair of new shoes_.

223. "He _combined together_ these facts:" leave out _together_.

224. "My brother called on me, and we _both_ took a walk:" leave out
_both_, which is unnecessary.

225. "Evil spirits are not occupied about the _dead corpses_ of bad men:"
leave out _dead_, which is altogether unnecessary, as it is _implied_ in
the word _corpses_, "_corpse_" and "_dead body_" being strictly
synonymous.

226. "He has gone to the _Lyceum_:" pronounce _Lyceum_ with the accent on
the second syllable, and not on the first.

227. "This is a picture of _Westminster Abbey_:" never say _Westminister_,
as if there were two words, _West-minister_.

228. "We are going to take a _holiday_:" this word was originally spelled
and pronounced _holyday_, being compounded of the two words _holy_
(meaning "_set apart_") and _day_. Custom, however, has changed the
orthography from _y_ to _i_, and made the first syllable rhyme with
_Poll_.

229. "It was referred to the _Committee_ on Ways and Means:" emphasize the
second, not the first syllable.

230. "He is now settled in _Worcester_:" pronounce as if written
_Wooster_. _Gloucester_ and _Leicester_ are pronounced _Gloster_ and
_Lester_. The termination _cester_ or _chester_, occurring in the names of
many English towns, is derived and corrupted from the Latin _Castra_,
camps; and every town so named is supposed to have been the site of a camp
of soldiers, during the possession of Britain by the Romans.

231. "_Relatives_ and _Relations_:" both these words designate kinsfolk,
and are in most instances used indiscriminately. _Relatives_, however, is
by some deemed the more proper and elegant.

232. "What a long _lirry_ he has to say!" This word should be pronounced
and spelt _lurry_; its more general meaning is a "heap," a "throng," a
"crowd," but is often applied to a long dull speech.

233. "_Diamonds_ are charcoals:" pronounce _diamonds_ in three syllables.

234. "Honor to the _patriot_ and the sage:" divide the syllables like
_pa-tri-ot_, not _pat-ri-ot_. Irish rowdyism has been called
"_Pat-riot-ism_."

235. "Do you _believe_ that he will _receive_ my letter?" observe that in
the former word the diphthong is _ie_, and in the latter _ei_. A
convenient rule for the spelling of such words is the following: _c_ takes
_ei_ after it; all other consonants are followed by _ie_:--as, dec_ei_ve,
repr_ie_ve.

236. "He is now confirmed in _idiotcy_:" say, _idiocy_; the _t_ in _idiot_
is dropped in forming the word.

237. "He raised the _national_ standard:" pronounce the first two
syllables like the word _nation_, never as if written _nash-ion-al_.

238. _Principal_ and _Principle_: be careful to observe the distinction
between these words. _Principal_ signifies _chief_; _principle_, _motive_.

239. "He favors the _Anti-Slavery_ reform:" pronounce _Anti_ with a
distinct sounding of the _i_; else the word becomes _ante_, which means
not "against," but "before,"--as "ante-deluvian," signifying "before the
Deluge."

240. _Cincinnati_ is often misspelled _Cincinnatti_. The name is derived
from _Cincinnatus_, a celebrated Roman.

241. "Her dress was made of _moiré antique_:" _moiré antique_ is an
article of _watered silk_, very well known to the "shopping" sisterhood,
but very frequently called "_Murray Antique_."

242. "It was mentioned in a _Californian newspaper_:" say, _California_
newspaper. No one says _Philadelphian_, or _Chicagonian_ journal.

243. "The lecture was _characterized_ as a brilliant performance:" accent
the first, and not the second syllable.

244. "This is one of the traditions of St. _Helena_:" accent _le_, and not
_Hel_.

245. "The boy was found by a _washwoman_:" say, _washerwoman_.

246. "St. John's is about two days nearer England than Halifax." [From an
account, in a New-York newspaper, of the Submarine Telegraph Expedition,
September, 1855.] Does it mean that St. John's is nearer to England than
Halifax is, or nearer to England than to Halifax?

247. "He wears a blue-spotted _neck-handkerchief_:" say, _neckerchief_,
or, still better, _neck-cloth_, or _cravat_. The original word is
_kerchief_, and not _handkerchief_, which is a _kerchief_ for the _hand_.

248. "The city was _illumined_ in honor of the victory:" better say,
_illuminated_. Distinguish between the pronunciation of _illumined_ and
_ill-omened_.

249. "She has brought the _cloze pins_ in a bag:" say, _clothes' pins_.

250. "He met with _luck_:" say either "_bad luck_," or "_good luck_;"
_luck_ primarily refers to simple "chance," although its derivatives,
_lucky_ and _luckily_, imply only _good fortune_.

251. "The _in-va-lid_ signed a deed, that was _in-val-id_:" pronounce the
former "_invalid_" with the accent on the _first_ syllable; the _latter_,
with the accent on the _second_.

252. "The _duke_ discharged his _duty_." Be careful to give the slender,
clear sound of _u_. Avoid saying _dook_ and _dooty_, or _doo_ for _dew_ or
_due_. Say _flute_, not _floot_; _suit_, not _soot_; _mute_, not _moot_.
As well might you say _bute_ for _boot_, or _shute_ for shoot.

253. "_Genealogy_, _geography_, and _geometry_ are words of Greek
derivation:" beware of saying _geneology_, _jography_, and _jometry_, a
very common practice.

254. "He made out the _inventory_:" place the accent in _inventory_ on the
syllable _in_, and NEVER on _ven_.

255. "He deserves _chastisement_:" say, _chas-tiz-ment_, with the accent
on _chas_, and NEVER on _tise_.

256. "He threw the _rind_ away:" never call _rind_, _rine_.

257. "His _knowledge_ is very great:" always pronounce _knowledge_ so as
to rhyme with _college_, and NEVER say _know-ledge_.

258. "They contributed to his _maintenance_:" pronounce _maintenance_ with
the accent on _main_, and never say _maintainance_.

259. "She wears a silk _gown_:" never say _gownd_.

260. "Maine is a _maritime_ State:" pronounce the last syllable of
_maritime_ so as to rhyme with _rim_.

261. "They _desisted_ from their _design_:" pronounce the _former s_ in
_desisted_ with a soft sound, and _always_ pronounce _design_ as if
written _de-zine_.

262. "They committed a _heinous_ crime:" pronounce _heinous_ as if spelled
_hay-nus_; NEVER call the word _hee-nus_ or _hain-yus_.

263. "He _hovered_ about the enemy:" pronounce _hovered_ so as to rhyme
with _covered_.

264. "He is a powerful _ally_:" _never_ place the accent on _al_ in
_ally_, as many do.

265. "_We have never been called, almost, to the consideration_ of the
Apocalypse, without finding fresh reasons for our opinion." [Such are the
words of a very eminent reviewer.] He should have said, "We have _scarcely
ever_ been called," or, "we have _almost never_."

266. "He is very _bigoted_:" never spell the last word with _double t_, a
very common mistake.

267. "The _Weekly Tribune_ has a large circulation:" pronounce Tribune as
if divided _Trib-une_, and not _Try-bune_.

268. "He said _as how_ you _was_ to do it:" say, he said _that you were to
do it_.

269. Never say, "_I acquiesce with you_," but, "_I acquiesce in your
proposal_, _in your opinion_," &c.

270. "He is a distinguished _antiquarian_:" say, _antiquary_.
_Antiquarian_ is an adjective; _antiquary_, a noun.

271. An injudicious disposition of a clause in a sentence frequently
creates great merriment in the reading. In Goldsmith's "History of
England," a book remarkable for its carelessness of style, we find the
following extraordinary sentence, in one of the chapters of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth: "This" [a communication to Mary Queen of Scots] "they
effected by conveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that
_supplied the family with ale through a chink in the wall of her
apartment_." A queer brewer that--to supply ale through a chink in the
wall! How easy the alteration to make the passage clear! "This they
effected by conveying their letters to her _through a chink in the wall of
her apartment, by means of a brewer that supplied the family with ale_."

272. "Lavater wrote on _Physiognomy_:" in the last word sound the _g_
distinctly, as _g_ is always pronounced before _n_, when it is not in the
same syllable; as, _indignity_, &c.

273. "She is a very amiable _girl_:" pronounce _girl_ as if written
_gurl_; _gal_ is a vulgarism; _gehl_ or _gul_ is an affectation of which
many polite persons are guilty.

274. "He built a large _granary_:" _do not_ pronounce _granary_ so as to
rhyme with _tannery_. Call the word _grainary_. Both pronunciations,
however, are given by scholars.

275. Beware of using _Oh!_ and _O_ indiscriminately: _Oh!_ is used to
express the emotion of _pain_, _sorrow_, or _surprise_; as, "_Oh!_ the
exceeding grace of God." _O_ is used to express _wishing_, _exclamation_,
or a direct _address_ to a person; as,

  "O mother, will the God above
  Forgive my faults like thee?"

276. Be careful to sound distinctly the _r_ in such words as _farther_,
_martyr_, _charter_, _murder_, &c. Never say, _fah-ther_, _mah-tyr_,
_chah-ter_ and _muh-der_. On the other hand, avoid _trilling_ the _r_, as
_mur-er-der_, _r'r'robber_. It is altogether too tragical for common life.

277. "The Duke of Wellington was an _Irishman_, but knew nothing of the
_Irish_ language:" beware of saying _Ierishman_ for _Irishman_, or
_Ierish_ for _Irish_; a very common mistake, which the "Know-Nothings" are
quick to detect.

278. "He did it _unbeknown_ to us:" say, _unknown_, &c.

279. "He lives in _affluence_, as he is in _affluent_ circumstances:"
beware of placing the accent in _affluence_ and _affluent_ on the syllable
_flu_ instead of on _af_, a very common error.

280. "If I say, 'They retreated _back_,' I use a word that is
_superfluous_, as _back_ is implied in the syllable _re_ in _retreated_:"
never place the accent on _flu_ in _superfluous_, but always on _per_.

281. "In reading Paley's 'Evidences of Christianity,' I unexpectedly _lit
on_ the passage I wanted:" say, _met with_ the passage, &c.

282. A gentleman having selected a book from the library shelves of the
Mechanics' Institute, went to the librarian to have the volume registered
under his name, and said, "_I have taken the life of Julius Cæsar_." "I
shall then," responded the librarian, "charge the work to Mr. Brutus!" Be
careful how you "take the lives" of distinguished men.

283. "He has a _bayonet_ to his gun:" never say _baggonet_. This error is
a peculiarity of the Wiltshire dialect, in England. In an old Wiltshire
song the following stanza occurs:

  "A hornet zet in a holler tree,
  A proper spiteful twoad was he;
  And merrily zung while he did zet,--
  His sting as sharp as a _baggonet_."

284. "Aunt Deborah is down with the _rheumatiz_:" say, _rheumatism_; this
is one among the _isms_, though a very unpopular one.

285. "It is _obligatory_ upon every honest man to go to the polls to-day:"
accent _lig_, and not _ga_.

286. "On the _contrary_:" accent _con_, not _tra_. The old song takes up
with a bad pronunciation, for the sake of a good rhyme:

      "Mistress Mary,
      Quite _contrary_,
  How does your garden grow?"

287. "That is altogether _above my bend_:" say, _out of my power_.

288. "He has _absquatulated_, and taken the specie with him:" _absconded_
is a more classical word.

289. "It's _eenamost_ time we had started:" say, _almost_.

290. "_I haven't ary one_:" say, _I have neither_, or, _I haven't either_.

291. "That man is in a _bad box_:" say, _bad predicament_, or bad
_situation_.

292. It may be doubted whether to say of a man "that _he barked up the
wrong tree_," is a complimentary or elegant metaphor.

293. "I will retain two-thirds, and give you the _balance_:" say,
_remainder_.

294. "I _calculate_ to go by steam:" say, "I _expect_."

295. Avoid using the phrase "_I cave in_," for "_I give up_." It savors of
slang.

296. Do not say, "_chicken fixings_," for "_trifles_," or "_extras_,"
connected with dress.

297. "He is a _cute_ man:" this is an inelegant abbreviation of _acute_,
and employed to mean _smart_. It may, however, be properly applied to
Yankees!

298. "He _dickered_ with him an hour:" say, "he _bargained_." This is a
word somewhat peculiar to New-York.

299. "_Do don't_" is a vulgar usage of the Southern States, especially
Georgia, for "_do not_."

300. "He is _done gone_:" say, _ruined_.

301. "We had a _dreadful_ fine time:" say, _very_, or _exceedingly_.

302. "It rains, and I want an umbrella _the worst kind_:" say, "_I am
greatly in want_," &c. An umbrella _of the worst kind_ would not be likely
to answer the best of purposes on a rainy day!

303. "The whole concern _fizzled out_:" say, _proved a failure_.

304. "As soon as I mentioned it to him, he _flared up_:" say, he _became
excited_, or _grew violent_.

305. "The choir sang _Old Hundred_:" pronounce _Hundred_ as written, and
not _Hunderd_.

306. "The message was sent by his _aid-de-camp_:" pronounce as if written
_ade-de-kawng_, avoiding, however, as much as possible a twang on the last
syllable.

307. "My _beard_ is long:" don't say _baird_.

308. "The blacksmith blows the _bellows_:" pronounce as written, and not
_bellus_.

309. "Let me help you to some _catsup_:" avoid saying _ketchup_.

310. "It is new _China ware_:" do not say, _chaney ware_; this latter
article exists only in the traditions of old women.

311. "The _combatants_ parted in good humor:" accent the first
syllable--never the second.

312. "We poled the raft up the _creek_:" pronounce as if written _krik_.

313. "Then spake the _warrior_ bold:" pronounce in two syllables, as
_war-yur_, not _war-ri-or_.

314. In using the word _venison_, sound the _i_: _venzun_ is a common,
though not elegant pronunciation.

315. _Tapestry_ is divided _tap-es-try_ and not _ta-pes-try_.

316. "He is only a _subaltern_:" accent the first syllable of _subaltern_.

317. "The barge is at the _quay_:" pronounce _quay_, _kay_.

318. "The path over the meadow was _queachy_:" this word, meaning _soft_
or _boggy_, is now obsolete, and cannot be used with propriety.

319. "He talks _pulpitically_:" this word, which some who copy
Chesterfield persist in using, has never by any good authority been
admitted into the language.

320. To _peff_, meaning to _cough faintly_ (like a sheep), is hardly a
useable word.

321. Be careful to distinguish between _pencil_, an instrument for
writing, and _pensile_, meaning _hanging down_.

322. _To yank_ is a vulgarism, meaning _to twitch powerfully_.

323. Avoid the slang phrase, "_I used to could_." Say, "_I could
formerly_."

324. "She _takes on_ about it greatly:" say, _grieves_.

325. "He _staved off_ the case two days longer:" say, he _put off_, or
_delayed_.

326. "He made a great _splurge_:" say, he made a _blustering effort_.

327. "I _reckon_ it is going to rain:" say, I _think_, or _expect_.
_Reckon_ applies to _calculation_.

328. "The basket is _pretty large_:" avoid, if possible, the use of the
word _pretty_ out of its legitimate signification; the language abounds
with substitutes more elegant.

329. "She weighs a _plaguy sight_:" say, _a great deal_.

330. "He _made tracks_ at sundown:" say, _he left_, or _escaped_.

331. "He was compelled to _fork over the cash_:" say, _to pay over_.

332. "_To flunk out_" is a vulgar expression for _to retire through fear_;
the most that can be tolerated is, _to sneak out_.

333. "When last observed, he was _going at full chisel_:" say, _at the top
of his speed_.

334. "That bill is a _counterfeit_:" the last syllable is pronounced as if
written _fit_, and not _feet_.

335. "I am very much _obliged_ to you:" do not say _obleeged_.

336. The following sentence affords an example of three words of similar
pronunciation, but different signification: "It is not easy to _pare_ a
_pear_ with a _pair_ of scissors."

337. "The _robber_ entered the dwelling, and secretly carried off the
silver:" say, _thief_; a _robber_ attacks violently, and commits his
depredations by main force; a _thief_ is one who uses secrecy and
deception.

338. "Go and _fetch_ me my riding-whip:" say, _bring_. _Fetch_ means to
_go and bring_; _go and fetch_ is repetition.

339. _To leave_ and _to quit_ are often used as synonymous terms, though
improperly; _to leave_ implies a design of returning soon--_to quit_, an
absence of a long time, or forever; as, in Shakespeare:--

          "----the very rats
  Instinctively had _quit_ it."--_Tempest_, i. 2.

"I shall _leave_ my house for a month before next Autumn; but I shall not
be obliged to _quit_ it until after Christmas."

340. _Mute_ and _dumb_. A _dumb_ man has not the power to speak; a _mute_
man either does not choose, or is not allowed to speak. It is, therefore,
more proper to say of a person who can neither hear nor speak, that he is
"deaf and _dumb_," than that he is a "deaf _mute_."

341. _Strong_ and _robust_. These words are frequently misused: a _strong_
man is able to bear a heavy burden, but not necessarily for a long time; a
_robust_ man bears _continual_ fatigue with ease; a _strong_ man may be
active and nimble; while an excess of muscular development, together with
a clumsiness of action, exclude these qualities from the _robust_ man:--

  "_Strong_ as a tower in hope, I cry Amen!"

                                  SHAKESPEARE, _Richard II._ i. 3.

  "For one who, though of drooping mien, had yet
  From nature's kindliness received a frame
  _Robust_ as ever rural labor bred."

                                  WORDSWORTH, _Excursion_, VI.

342. "Isaac Newton _invented_ the law of gravitation:" say, _discovered_.
"Galileo _discovered_ the telescope:" say, _invented_.

343. To _hear_ and to _listen_ have each distinct degrees of meaning. To
_hear_ implies no effort or particular attention. To _listen_ implies some
eagerness to hear. An old proverb says, "They that _listen_ seldom _hear_
any good of themselves."

344. _Ought_ and _should_ both express obligation, but the latter is not
so binding as the former. "Children _ought to_ love their parents, and
_should_ be neat in their appearance."

345. _Alone_ and _only_ are often misapplied. "He _only_ could do it,"
means that no other but himself could do it; "he _alone_ could do it,"
should mean that he, without the assistance of others, could do it.

346. "Please the pigs."--(_Old Proverb._) This is a corruption from
"Please the _pyx_." The _pyx_ is the receptacle which contains the
consecrated wafer on Romish altars; and the exclamation is equal to
"Please God." This corruption is as curious a one as that of "tawdry" from
"'t Audrey," or "at St. Audrey's Fair," famous for the sale of
frippery--showy, cheap, and worthless.

347. "The _partridge_ is a delightful bird:" do not say _patridge_. Also,
do not say _pasley_ for _parsley_.

348. "After this, let him hide his _diminished head_:" this common phrase
is a poetical quotation from Milton, and is therefore proper to be used
even when it does not _literally_ express the idea:--

  "At whose sight all the stars
  Hide their _diminished heads_."

349. "That bourne from whence no traveler returns." How often are
precisely these words spoken? They are improperly quoted from Shakespeare,
in Hamlet, and correctly read as follows:--

  "That undiscovered country, from whose bourne
  No traveler returns."

350. "Bring me my _waistcoat_:" pronounce as if written _waste-coat_, and
not _weskut_. It should rhyme, as it did in an old ballad, with "_laced
coat_."

351. "Your _bonnet_ to its right use."--(_Shakespeare:_) never say
_bunnet_.

352. "It is not cold enough to wear my _gloves_:" pronounce as if written
_gluvs_, and to rhyme with _loves_. In "Fair Rosamond" the following
illustrative stanza occurs:--

  "He said he had his _gloves_ from France:
    The Queen said, 'That can't be:
  If you go there for _glove-making_,
    It is without the _g_.'"

353. "_Egad!_ what great good luck!" This word is now inelegantly used,
except in certain species of poetry, where it is introduced with much
effect, as in the following distich:--

  "All tragedies, _egad!_ to me sound oddly;
  I can no more be serious, than you godly."

354. "The frigate is now in the Yellow Sea, or _thereabouts_:" say,
_thereabout_. This term is a transposed combination of _about there_;
there is no such word as _thereabouts_. The same may be said of
_hereabouts_, and _whereabouts_.

355. "Whether he will or _no_:" say, _not_. The reason of this correction
is clearly seen by supplying what is needed to complete the sense: Whether
he will or _will not_.

356. "He looked at it first _lengthways_, then _sideways_:" say,
_lengthwise_ and _sidewise_. Also, say _otherwise_ instead of _otherways_.
A nobleman said to his fool, "I am _wise_, and you are _otherwise_."
"Yes," replied his jester, "you are _wise_, and I am _another wise_."

357. If you are a landlord, beware of incorrectly using such an expression
as in the following: A landed proprietor went to a tenant with a view of
increasing his rent, and said to him, "Neighbor, I am going to _raise your
rent_." "Thank you, sir," was the reply, "for I am utterly unable to
_raise it myself_."

358. "Will you _accept_ of this slight testimonial?" Omit _of_, which is
superfluous, and weakens the sentence.

359. "He convinced his opponent by _dint_ of good reasoning:" _dint_,
meaning _force_ or strength, is an obsolete word, and should not now be
employed.

360. "The Danube _empties_ into the Black Sea:" say, _flows_; to _empty_
means _to make vacant_; no river can properly be called _empty_, until it
is entirely dried up.

361. Such words as _bamboozle_, _topsyturvy_, _helterskelter_,
_hurlyburly_, and _pellmell_ are generally to be avoided. They answer,
however, for familiar conversation.

362. Never say _seraphims_, for the plural of _seraph_, but _seraphim_;
the same rule holds with _cherubims_. _Cherubs_ and _seraphs_ are proper
plurals, suiting a familiar style of speaking or writing, while _cherubim_
and _seraphim_ are to be used only in more dignified and solemn discourse.

363. "_There's_ the books you wanted:" say, _there are_: avoid all
abbreviations when they lead to a grammatical error, as in the present
instance.

364. "This prisoner has, of all the gang, committed _fewer_ misdemeanors:"
say, _fewest_. We may say _fewer than_ all, but we must say _fewest of_
all.

365. "I esteem you more than _the others_:" this sentence is equivocal.
Does it mean, "I esteem you more than _I esteem the others_," or, "I
esteem you more than _the others esteem you_?"

366. "The most eminent scholars will, on some points, differ _among one
another_:" say, _among themselves_.

367. "He, from that moment, doubled his _kindness and caresses of me_:"
say, "kindness _for_ and caresses of me;" by omitting _caresses_ we have,
"He doubled his _kindness of_ me," which is not good English.

368. _To differ from_ and _to differ with_: to _differ from_ a man means
to have an opinion different from his; to _differ with_ a person signifies
a _quarrel_ or _rupture_.

369. "He barely escaped having _one or two broken heads_:" a man has but
_one_ head, let it be broken or whole. Say, "He _once or twice barely
escaped_ having a broken head."

370. "Whenever _I fall into that man's conversation_ I am entertained and
profited:" say, _fall into conversation with that man_.

371. "The lecturer _spoke to several points_:" say, "spoke _on_ several
points." He spoke _to_ his audience.

372. "I shall regard your _strictures_ only so far as _concerns_ my own
errors:" say, _concern_; the phrase when filled out should read, "only so
far as _they concern_ my own errors."

373. "I found him better than I expected _to have found him_:" say, _to
find him_.

374. "I perceived that he was totally blind _with half an eye_:" say, "I
perceived, with half an eye, that he was totally blind." Otherwise, to a
man _totally blind_ you allot _half an eye_!

375. The word _only_ is often wrongly placed in the sentence, and made to
express an idea which is not designed to be conveyed. "Not _only_ Chinese
are superstitious," implies that others besides the Chinese are
superstitious. "Chinese are not _only_ superstitious," implies that in
addition to being superstitious, they have some other characteristics.
"Chinese not _only_ are superstitious," leaves room for something still
further to be implied of the Chinese than superstition, and which is not
necessarily the predicate of _are_; as, "Chinese not only are
superstitious, but they persecute those who do not put faith in
Confucius."

376. _Not the least_ and _nothing less than_, sometimes literally convey
just the opposite of what is intended. "He has _not the least_ excuse for
going," may mean that he has _a great excuse_, or _none at all_. "He seeks
_nothing less than_ worldly honor," may signify that nothing inferior to
worldly honor will satisfy his desire; or, on the other hand, it may mean
that nothing is less sought by him than worldly honor. Such expressions,
therefore, are to be used with caution, else they will mislead.

377. Care should be taken in the use of epithets. For instance, in the
sentence, "_A wise and good man_ should be respected," the words _wise_
and _good_ may properly be applied to the same man; but if the sentence
should be altered to read, "An _old and young man_," it is obvious that
both epithets could not relate to the same person.

378. Never say _turkle soup_, for _turtle soup_.

379. The word _long_ should not now be employed to signify _many_. An
example of this early usage is found in the Fifth Commandment, "that thy
days may be _long_ upon the land." The following lines furnish an instance
of the verb _to lengthen_, meaning to _make many_:--

              "The best of all ways
              To _lengthen_ our days,
  Is to take a few hours from the night, my lad."

380. "They returned _back again_ to the _same_ city _from_ whence they
came _forth_:" omit the italicized words, which are redundant and
inelegant.

381. "Have you any leisure _upon your hands_?" omit _upon your
hands_,--not so much because anything after "leisure" is superfluous, in
such a sentence, as because the idea of _having leisure upon your hands_
is absurd.

382. "Seven lads were present, and he gave them _all_ a book:" say, _gave
them each_ a book. _All_ refers to a number of persons or things taken
_collectively_, as _one body_; _each_ refers to _every individual_,
separately considered.

383. "Lend me your _umberell_:" say, _umbrella_. The former pronunciation,
however, is allowed by _poetic license_, as in the following, adapted from
Thomas Moore:--

  "Oh, ever thus from childhood's hour,
    Has chilling fate upon me fell!
  There always comes a soakin' shower
    When I hain't got an _umbrell_."

384. We lately met a grammarian, who had just made a tour through the
mines, conjugating, or, rather, cogitating thus: "Positive, _mine_;
comparative _miner_; superlative, _minus_!"

385. "Put not thy secret into the mouth of the _Bosphorus_, for it will
betray it to the ears of the Black Sea."--(_Oriental Proverb._) Pronounce
_Bosphorus_ as if written _Bosforus_, and not _Bos-porous_.

386. Be careful to use the hyphen (-) correctly: it joins compound words,
and words broken by the ending of a line. The use of the hyphen will
appear more clearly from the following example: "_many colored_ wings"
means _many_ wings which are _colored_; but "_many-colored_ wings" means
"wings of _many colors_."

387. "I am _afraid_ it will rain:" say, _I fear_. _Afraid_ expresses
terror; _fear_ may mean only _anxiety_.

388. Never say _o-fences_ for _offences_; _pison_ for _poison_;
_co-lection_ for _collection_; _voiolent_ for _violent_; _kivver_ for
_cover_; _afeard_ for _afraid_; _debbuty_ for _deputy_. The last three
examples are very common.

389. "It is a mere _cipher_:" never spell _cipher_ with a _y_.

390. "I was _necessitated_ to do it:" a poor expression, and often made
worse by _necessiated_ being used: say, I was _obliged_, or _compelled_,
to do it.

391. "Gibbon wrote the _Rise_ and Fall of the Roman Empire:" pronounce
_Rise_, the noun, so as to rhyme with _price_; _Rise_, the verb, rhymes
with _prize_.

392. "He joined his _regiment_ last week:" never say, _ridgiment_ for
_regiment_.

393. "He bought a _gimlet_:" never spell the last word _gimblet_, as many
do.

394. "He is a supporter of the _Government_:" beware of omitting the _n_
in the second syllable of _Government_--a very common practice.

395. "Received this day _of_ Mr. Brown ten dollars:" say, "Received this
day _from_," &c.

396. "Of whatever you _get_, endeavor to save something; and with all your
_getting, get_ wisdom:" carefully avoid saying _git_ for _get_, and
_gitting_ for _getting_.

397. "So intent was he on the song he was _singing_, while he stood by the
fire, that he did not perceive that his clothes were _singeing_." Verbs
ending with a _single e_, omit the _e_ when the termination _ing_ is
added, as, _give_, _giving_; in _singeing_, however, the _e_ must be
retained, to prevent its being confounded with _singing_. The _e_ must
also be retained in _dyeing_, to distinguish it from _dying_.

398. The following sentences may be studied: "The _dyer dyes_ daily, yet
he _dies_ not." "The _miner minds_ the _minor mines_." "It is not _meet_
to _mete_ out such _meat_." "He performed a great _feat_ with his _feet_
at the _fête_." (_Fête_ is pronounced _fate_.)

399. "_Lower_ the sails, as the sky begins to _lower_:" pronounce _low_ in
the _former_ so as to rhyme with _mow_, and _low_ in the _latter_ so as to
rhyme with _cow_.

400. "There was a great _row_ on Monday, in Tryon _Row_:" pronounce the
former _row_ so as to rhyme with _cow_--the latter _row_, so as to rhyme
with _mo_.

401. "His _surname_ is Clifford:" never spell the _sur_ in "surname"
_sir_, which shows an ignorance of its true derivation, which is from the
Latin.

402. "The buildings are so old that they pay _almost no rent_ now:"
_scarcely any rent_, is better.

403. "His _mamma_ sent him to a preparatory school:" _mamma_ is often
written with one _m_ only, which is not, as may at first be supposed, in
imitation of the French _maman_, but in sheer ignorance.

404. Active verbs often take a neuter sense; as, "_The house is
building_:" here, _is building_ is used in a neuter signification, because
it has no object after it. By this rule are explained such sentences as,
"_Application is wanting_;" "_The Grammar is printing_," &c.

405. "He _attackted_ me without the slightest provocation:" say,
_attacked_.

406. "I called on him every day in the week _successfully_:" very common,
but incorrect; say, _successively_.

407. "I fear I shall _discommode_ you:" it is better to say, _incommode_.

408. "I can do it _equally as well as_ he:" leave out _equally_, which is
superfluous.

409. "We could not forbear _from_ doing it:" leave out _from_, which is
unnecessary; or say, _refrain from_.

410. "He was totally dependent _of_ his father:" say, dependent _on_ his
father.

411. "They accused him _for_ neglecting his duty:" say, _of_ neglecting,
&c.

412. "They have a great resemblance _with_ each other:" say, _to_ each
other.

413. "I entirely dissent _with_ him:" say, _from_ him.

414. "He was made much _on_ at the Springs:" say, made much _of_, &c.

415. "He is a man _on_ whom you can confide:" say, _in_ whom, &c.

416. "He was obliged to _fly_ the country:" say, _flee_ the country. A
very common mistake.

417. "The snuffers _wants_ mending:" say, _want_ mending. No one would
say, "My _pantaloons is_ ripped."

418. "His conduct admits _of_ no apology:" omit _of_, which is quite
unnecessary.

419. "A _gent_ has been here inquiring for you:" a detestable, but very
common expression; say, a _gentleman_ has been, &c. Oliver Wendell Holmes
hits off this liberty with language, in the following happy couplet:--

  "The things called _pants_, in certain documents,
  Were never made for _gentlemen_, but _gents_."

420. "That was _all along of_ you:" say, "That was _all your fault_."

421. "You have no _call_ to be angry with me:" say, no _occasion_, &c.

422. "Too free an _indulgence_ in luxuries _enervate_ and _injure_ the
system:" say, _enervates_ and _injures_, &c. The plural, _luxuries_,
standing directly before the verb, (which should be _enervates_, in the
singular,) deceives the ear. Errors of this kind are very common, though a
moment's thought would correct them. The verb must agree with its subject
in person and in number; if the _noun_ is in the singular, the _verb_ that
belongs to it must also be in the singular.

423. "A father divided a portion of his property _among_ his two children,
and the remainder he distributed _between_ the poor:" say, _between_ his
two children, and _among_ the poor. _Between_ is applicable to two only,
_among_ to three or more.

424. "_Every_ child should obey _their_ parents:" say, _his_ parents. The
pronoun must agree with the noun in number, &c.

425. "He is a person _who_ I respect greatly:" say, _whom_. "Be careful
_who_ you trust:" _whom_ you trust.

426. "Let me consider _of_ this matter." "The culprit dreaded to enter
_in_ the prison." "The laborers were not allowed to want _for_ anything."
Leave out the _italicized_ words--the sense being complete without them.

427. _Cupola_ is often pronounced _cupalo_; _foliage_, _foilage_;
_future_, _futur_; _nature_, _natur_: all of which errors should be
carefully avoided.

428. "'Ow 'appens it that _H_englishmen so _h_often misplace their
_h_aitches?" It is a cockneyism; and if you have fallen into the habit, it
will require perhaps more perseverance than you imagine, to correct it.

429. Do you say _w_agabond or _v_agabond, _w_inegar or _v_inegar, _w_ery
or _v_ery, _v_alking or _w_alking, _v_atchman or _w_atchman? It is a local
custom, but if you have any taint of it, don't sing "_V_illikins and his
Dinah."

430. Provid_ence_, confid_ence_, and similar words, are often pronounced
Provid_unce_, confid_unce_, &c., substituting _unce_ for _ence_. So also,
words ending in _ance_, as mainte_nance_, suste_nance_, SURVEIL_lance_,
are pronounced falsely mainten_unce_, susten_unce_, &c.

431. _Coming_, _going_, _according_, &c., are often pronounced without the
final _g_: speak them distinctly, and pronounce difficult words with
de-lib-er-a-tion.

432. If you are a Yankee, you should (though, as a general thing, you
_will not_) take special pains with your vowel sounds, that they be not
formed through the nasal cavities. Don't say _heow_, _ceow_, _confeound_,
for _how_, _cow_, &c.

433. If you are a Western man, you are liable to give your vowel sounds
too great breadth. You should not say _bar_ for _bear_, _hum_ for _home_,
_dawlar_ for _dollar_; and it is better to avoid using such expressions as
_I reckon_, _I guess_, _I calculate_, too frequently.

434. "I am going _a fishing_:" be bold enough to be one among the foremost
to break away from the bad habit of saying _a fishing_, _a talking_, _a
courting_, &c. This custom, however, should be retained in quoting
proverbs and wise sayings; these are better in proportion as they are
older; for example: "_Who goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing._" The
quaintness would be destroyed by saying simply _borrowing_ and
_sorrowing_.

435. Some people add a superfluous preposition at the end of a
sentence--"More than you think _for_." This is awkward.

436. "Then think _on_ the friend who once welcomed it too," &c. &c.: say,
_of_.

437. _Thou_ and _thee_ are no longer used in spelling or writing, except
by some of The Friends; but proverbial citations, originally expressed in
that form, lose much of their beauty and force by alteration; as, "If thou
seest thy house in flames, approach and warm thyself by it." How greatly
would a change of person tame the spirit of this fine proverb!

438. "By the street of '_By-and-By_,' one arrives at the house of
'Never.'" Do not say, _By'mby_.

439. Be careful to observe the _two plurals_ of the following nouns:

  Singular.   First Plural.                    Second Plural.

  _Brother,_  _Brothers_ (of the same          _Brethren_ (of the same
                 parents),                        society).

  _Die,_      _Dies_ (for coining),            _Dice_ (for gaming).

  _Index,_    _Indexes_ (tables of contents),  _Indices_ (signs in
                                                  algebra).

  _Pea,_      _Peas_ (referring to a           _Pease_ (referring to the
                 limited number),                 whole species).

  _Penny,_    _Pennies_ (coins),               _Pence_ (the value).

  _Cow,_      _Cows_ (a herd of cattle),       _Kine_ (the species).

  _Sow,_      _Sows_ (a litter),               _Swine_ (the species).

  _Genius,_   _Geniuses_ (men of genius),      _Genii_ (imaginary spirits).

440. Different shades of meaning may be expressed by slight variations in
the position of the important words in a sentence. For example, "_The
Paradise Lost of Milton_," is not exactly the same in import as,
"_Milton's Paradise Lost_;" in the former, attention is called to the
author--in the latter, to the poem.

441. In uniting the plural of _one_, _two_, _three,_ do not use the
apostrophe ['] as _one's_, _two's_, _three's._ Good writers never conform
to the latter mode. Wordsworth, who was remarkably particular, not only in
the choice of his words but in their orthography, wrote:

  "The sun has long been set,
    The stars are out by _twos and threes_;
  The little birds are piping yet
    Among the bushes and the trees."

442. "_How's yourself_, this morning?" an exceedingly common, but very
objectionable expression: say, "_How are you_;" &c.

443. "Wanted, two apprentices, who will be treated as _one_ of the
family:" great practical difficulty would be found in realizing such
treatment! Say, "as _members_ of the family."

444. The following lines afford an instance of the ingenious uses to which
the English language may be put:

  "You _sigh for_ a _cipher_, but _I sigh for you;_
    Oh, _sigh for no cipher_, but oh, _sigh for me;_
  Oh, let not my _sigh for_ a _cipher_ go,
    But give _sigh for sigh, for I sigh_ for you so!"

The above is more briefly expressed in the following manner:

  "U O a O, but I O u,
  Oh, O no O, but oh, O me;
  Oh, let not my O a O go,
  But give O O I O u so!"

445. Sometimes _but_ is incorrectly substituted for _that_: as, "I have no
doubt _but_ he will be here to-night." Sometimes for the conjunction _if_,
as, "I shouldn't wonder _but_ that was the case." And sometimes _two_
conjunctions are used instead of one, as, "_If that_ I have offended him,"
"_After that_ he had seen the parties," &c. All this is very awkward and
should be avoided.

446. "My hands are _chopped_:" say, _chapped_.

447. "This will serve as a _preventative_:" say, _preventive_.

448. "A _nishe_ young man," "What _makesh_ you laugh?" "If he _offendsh_
you, don't speak to him," "_Ash_ you please," "Not _jush_ yet," "We
always _passh_ your house in going to call on _Missh Yatesh_." This is
decided, unmitigated _cockneyism_, having its parallel in nothing except
the broken English of the sons of Abraham, and to adopt it in conversation
is certainly "not speaking like a Christian."

449. Never say, "Cut it in _half_," for this you cannot do unless you
could _annihilate one_ half. You may "cut it in two," or "cut it in
halves," or "cut it through," or "divide it," but no human ability will
enable you _to cut it in half_.

451. _To lay and to lie._--_To lay_ is an active or transitive verb, and
must always have an object, expressed or understood. _To lie_ (not meaning
_to tell a falsehood_) is a neuter or intransitive, and therefore does not
admit of an object. The only real difficulty arises from the fact, that
the past tense of "lie," when used without an auxiliary, is the same as
the present of "lay." But a little attention will obviate this. Nothing
can be more erroneous than to say, "I shall go and lay down." The question
which naturally arises in the mind of the discriminating hearer is,
"_What_ are you going to lay down--money, carpets, plans, or what?" for,
as a transitive verb is used, an object is wanted to complete the sense.
The speaker means, that he himself is going to _lie down_. "My brother
_lays_ ill of a fever," should be, "My brother _lies_," &c.

  VERB ACTIVE.                              VERB NEUTER.

  _To lay._                                 _To lie._

  Present Tense.                            Present Tense.

  I lay           }                   I lie        }
  Thou layest     } money,            Thou liest   } down,
  He lays         } carpets,          He lies      } too long,
  We lay          } plans,            We lie       } on a sofa,
  You lay         } --any _thing_.    You lie      } --any _where_.
  They lay        }                   They lie     }


  Imperfect Tense.                          Imperfect Tense.

  I laid          }                   I lay        }
  Thou laidest    } money,            Thou layest  } down,
  He laid         } carpets,          He lays      } too long,
  We laid         } plans,            We lay       } on a sofa,
  You laid        } --any _thing_.    You lay      } --any _where_.
  They laid       }                   They lay     }

  Present Participle, Laying.         Present Participle, Lying.
  Perfect Participle, Laid.           Perfect Participle, Lain.

452. Many people have an odd way of saying, "I expect," when they mean
only "I think," or "I conclude;" as, "I expect my brother went to Richmond
to-day," "I expect those books were sent to Paris last year." _Expect_ can
relate only to _future_ time, and must be followed by a future tense, or a
verb in the infinitive mood; as, "I expect my brother _will go_ to
Richmond to-day," "I expect _to find_ those books were sent to Paris last
year."

453. "A _summer's_ morning," should be, A _summer_ morning.

454. The vulgar speaker uses adjectives instead of adverbs, and says,
"This letter is written _shocking_;" the genteel speaker uses adverbs
instead of adjectives, and says, "This writing looks _shockingly_."

455. "_Nobody else_ but him," should be, _Nobody_ but him.

456. "That _ain't_ just," should be, That _is not_ just.

457. "He was killed _by_ a cannon-ball," should be, He was killed _with_ a
cannon-ball. He was killed _by_ the cannoneer.

458. "A _new pair_ of gloves," should be, A _pair of new_ gloves.

459. "_Before_ I do that, I must _first_ be paid," should be, Before I do
that, I must be paid.

460. A grammatical play upon the word THAT:

  "Now _that_ is a word which may often be joined,
  For _that that_ may be doubled is clear to the mind;
  And _that that that_ is right, is as plain to the view,
  As _that that that that_ we use is rightly used too;
  And _that that that that that_ line has in it, is right--
  In accordance with grammar, is plain in our sight."

461. "He will go _from thence_ to-morrow." The preposition "from" is
included in these adverbs, therefore it becomes tautology in sense when
prefixed to them.

462. "Equally as well," is a very common expression, and a very incorrect
one; the adverb of comparison, "as," has no right in the sentence.
"Equally well," "Equally high," "Equally dear," should be the
construction; and if a complement be necessary in the phrase, it should be
preceded by the preposition "with," as, "The wall was equally high with
the former one," "The goods at Smith's are equally dear with those sold at
the shop next door," &c. "Equally the same" is tautology.

463. Some persons talk of "_continuing on_:" in what other direction would
it be possible to _continue_?

464. "The satin measured twelve yards before I cut this piece _off of_
it." "The fruit was gathered _off of_ that tree." Omit _of_; or, omitting
_off of,_ insert _from_.

465. "He left his horse, and got _on to_ a stage-coach," "He jumped _on
to_ the floor," "She laid it _on to_ a dish," "I threw it _on to_ the
fire." Why use two prepositions where one would be quite as explicit, and
far more elegant? Nobody would think of saying, "He came to New-York,
_for_ to go to the exhibition."

466. "No other resource _but_ this was allowed him:" say, "No other
resource _than_ this," &c.

467. "I don't know but _what_ I shall go to White Plains to-morrow:" say,
"I don't know but _that_," &c.

468. "One of those houses _were_ sold last week," "Each of the daughters
_are_ to have a separate share," "Every tree in those plantations _have_
been injured by the storm," "Either of the children _are_ at liberty to
claim it." Here it will be perceived that the pronouns "one," "each,"
"every," "either," are the true nominatives to the verbs; but the
intervening noun in the plural number, in each sentence, deludes the ear;
and the speaker, without reflection, renders the verb in the plural
instead of the singular number.

469. "Many still die annually _from_ the plague:" say, _of_ the plague.

470. "He spoke _contemptibly_ of him," should be, He spoke
_contemptuously_ of him.

471. "_Was_ you?" should be, _Were_ you?

472. "This is the more _perfect_ of the two:" say, More _complete_.
_Perfect_ rarely admits comparison.

473. Avoid all slang and vulgar words and phrases, as, _Anyhow_, _Bating_,
_Bran new_, _To blow up_, _Bother_, _Cut_, _Currying favor_, _Fork out_,
_Half an eye_, _I am up to you_, _Kick up_, _Scrape_, _The Scratch_, _Walk
into_.

474. "Go _over_ the bridge," should be, Go _across_ the bridge.

475. "_I was some distance from home_," should be, I was _at_ some
distance from home.

476. "Is Mr. Smith _in_?" should be, Is Mr. Smith _within_?

477. "It is _above_ a month since," should be, It is _more_ than a month
since.

478. "Vegetables were _plenty_," should be, Vegetables were _plentiful_.

479. "We both were _very disappointed_." This is an incomplete expression:
say, _very much_, or _very greatly_. No one would think of saying, "We
both were _very pleased_."

480. "It is I who _is_ to receive the appointment:" say, who _am_ to
receive; _who_ is in the first person, and the verb of which it is the
subject must be in the same.

481. Never say _biscake_, for _biscuit_.

482. "Passengers are _not requested_ to let down the chains, before the
boat is fastened to the bridge." [From a printed regulation on one of the
New-York and Brooklyn ferry-boats.] The reading should be, "Passengers
_are requested not to let down_ the chains."

483. "How will you _swap_ jack-knives?" _swap,_ although it is a word
familiarly used in connection with "jack-knives," is a term that cannot
lay the least claim to elegance. Use some other of the many mercantile
expressions to which trade has given rise.

484. "He's put his nose to the _grin-stone_ at an early age." [A remark
usually made by old ladies, suggested by the first marriage among their
grandsons.] Say, _grind-stone_. A _grin-stone_ implies a stone that
"grins," whereas, especially in this instance, the "nose" fulfills that
office.

485. The importance of punctuating a written sentence is often neglected.
Space does not permit the giving of rules on this subject, in this book.
Business correspondence is generally blemished by many omissions of this
character; for example, "Messrs G Longman & Co have recd a note from the
Cor Sec Nat Shipwreck Soc informing them of the loss of one of their
vessels off the N E Coast of S A at 8 P M on the 20 of Jan." A clergyman,
standing in his pulpit, was once handed a slip of paper, to be read in the
hearing of the congregation, which was intended to convey the following
notice: "A man going to sea, his wife desires the prayers of the church."
But the sentence was improperly punctuated, and he read, "A man going to
see his wife, desires the prayers of the church!"

486. "The knave thereupon commenced rifling his _friend's_ (as he called
him) _pocket_:" say, "The knave commenced rifling the _pocket of his
friend_, as he facetiously called him." The possessive case, and the word
that governs it, must not be separated by an intervening clause.

487. "I owe _thee_ a heavy debt of gratitude, and _you_ will not permit me
to repay it:" say, either "I owe _you_," &c., preserving "and _you_ will"
in the second clause; or, "I owe _thee_," and altering "and _you_ will"
into "and _thou wilt_."

488. "Every lancer and every rifleman _were at their post_:" say, _was at
his_ post.

489. "I can lift as many pounds _as he has_:" add _lifted_.

490. Do not use _to_, the sign of the infinitive mood, for the infinitive
itself. "I have not written to him, and I am not likely _to_," should
read, "I am not likely _to write to him_."

491. The word _agree_ is sometimes followed by the wrong preposition. We
should say, agree _with_ a person--_to_ a proposition--_upon_ a thing
among ourselves.

492. We should say _compare with_, in respect of quality--_compare to_,
for the sake of illustration.

493. We should say copy _after_ a person--_copy from_ a thing.

494. _Between_ is properly applied only to two objects; _among_, to three
or more. "A father divided a portion of his property _between_ his two
sons; the rest he distributed _among_ the poor."

495. _In_ should not be used for _into_, after verbs denoting entrance.
"Come _in_ my parlor," should read, "Come _into_ my parlor."

496. "We confide _in_, and have respect _for_, the good." Such a form of
expression is strained and awkward. It is better to say, "We confide _in_
the good, and have respect for _them_," or, "We _trust_ and _respect_ the
good."

497. "This veil of flesh parts the visible and the invisible world:" say,
"parts the visible _from_ the invisible." It certainly is not meant that
the veil of flesh _parts_ (or _divides_) each of these worlds.

498. "Every leaf, every twig, every blade, every drop of water, _teem_
with life:" say, _teems_.

499. "Dr. Prideaux used to relate that when he brought the manuscript of
his Connection of the Old and the New Testaments to the publisher, _he
told him_ it was a dry subject, and that the printing could not be safely
ventured upon unless he could enliven the work with a little humor." The
sense alone, and not the _sentence_, indicates to whom _he_ and _him_
respectively refer; such a form of expression is faulty, because it may
lead to a violation of _perspicuity_, which is one of the most essential
qualities of a good style.

500. The last direction which this little book will give, on the subject
with which it has been occupied, is one that long ago was given in the
greatest of books--"Let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel of
Christ." If obedience to this injunction may not guard him who heeds it
against the commission of such mistakes as are numbered in this catalogue,
it will not fail to lead him out of the way of errors more grievous and
solemn.




THE SPELLER AND DEFINER'S MANUAL.

BY WILLIAM W. SMITH, Principal of Grammar School No. 1, New-York; Author
of The Speller's Manual.


This work contains about fourteen thousand of the most useful words in the
English language, correctly spelled, pronounced, defined, and arranged in
classes, together with rules for spelling, prefixes and suffixes, with
their significations, rules for use of capitals, punctuation and other
marks used in writing and printing, quotations from other languages used
in English composition, abbreviations, &c., to which is added a
+Vocabulary+ for reference. Words which resemble each other in
pronunciation, but have different meanings, are arranged together, and
occupy about one eighth of the entire work, containing nearly three
hundred pages. The sentences for examples for pupils (each embracing two
or more of these words) will be found very instructive and interesting.
While +The Speller and Definer's Manual+ supplies all that can be desired
in an ordinary dictionary or speller, it furnishes much important
information that cannot be found in these, and presents a study, usually
dry and uninteresting, in a natural and attractive manner. It is adapted
to the capacities of children, and will essentially aid the teacher in the
work of instruction by suggesting _questions_ and _ideas_ that are very
often overlooked amid the anxieties of the school-room.

It will be found to be one of the most useful works for schools or
+SELF-INSTRUCTION+ ever issued as a text-book, and its examination will
abundantly repay any friend of education.

The Manual has been adopted by the Board of Education for use in the
Public Schools of New-York City.

We invite attention to the following extracts of notices of this work from
city papers:


NOTICES OF THE PRESS.

THE GRADUAL SERIES OF READERS. BY D. B. TOWER, A. M., (Principal of Park
Latin School, Boston,) AND CORNELIUS WALKER, A. M. (Principal of Wells
Grammar School, Boston.)


The _first essential_ of good reading is a _distinct articulation_. This
can only result from practice of the elementary sounds and their
combinations. All of these simple elements and their combinations are
given, with ample directions, arranged in the simplest and most compact
form, in the first books of Tower's series.

The _next points_ are _Emphasis_ and the _Tones_.

These are set forth and illustrated in the last three Readers. The
elements of expression requisite for the utterance of every sentiment are
clearly described and explained by appropriate examples. By these
examples, it is clearly shown how a passage is to be read, and thence is
deduced a rule or principle that all similar passages are to be read in a
similar manner.

The character of the selections is such as to claim the attention of all
who are in search of good reading matter. They are exciting, instructive,
and interesting, and admirably adapted to the capacity of the pupils.

The higher books of the series contain selections from authors who are
considered standards in their respective departments. The dignity and
objects of literature are distinctly brought to view, whether in the form
of prose to persuade and instruct--in that of poetry, to please the
fancy--or in that of the drama, to move the passions.

The character of the selections in these two books is such as to claim the
attention of all who are in search of _reading matter_ that will _wear_.

The superiority of these books is acknowledged, wherever they have been
brought to a practical test. The more intelligent any school committee, or
teachers are, the more readily are these Readers appreciated, and the more
eagerly are they sought for use in the school-room. So decided is the
preference for them, among the educated, over every other series, that
they are gradually but surely superseding them all, and going into general
use in all the best schools in our country.

Tower's ELEMENTS OF GRAMMAR. PRICE 25 CENTS.

FIRST LESSONS IN LANGUAGE: OR, ELEMENTS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR. BY DAVID B.
TOWER, A. M., AND PROF. BENJAMIN F. TWEED, A. M.


This little book was prepared for beginners, that they might feel their
way understandingly, and become interested in this sometimes dry study.
This subject is presented in a natural way, avoiding all unnecessary
innovations. The plan is simple and plain, introducing only one thing at a
time, that the pupil may see a reason for each step, and thus be led to
think. It is concise, that the whole subject may be placed before the
learner in the simplest manner and encumbered by as few words for the
memory as possible, that the interest may be kept up till he is master of
the study. By easy questions, principles are deduced from familiar
examples already explained for the sake of such inferences, that a clear
understanding of these principles and their application may be acquired,
rather than the words used to explain and describe them.

GRADUAL LESSONS IN GRAMMAR;

OR, GUIDE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY THE ANALYSIS AND
COMPOSITION OF SENTENCES; WITH A SEQUEL. BY DAVID B. TOWER, A. M., AND
PROF. BENJAMIN F. TWEED, A. M.

The first object in the Gradual Lessons in Grammar, is to render the pupil
familiar with the different CLASSES of words, in the various _relations_
in which they may be used, by directing attention to the manner in which
they affect the _meaning_ of the sentence. Thus it is stated, that "words
used as names are nouns." Then follow examples of the different kinds of
nouns, and the pupil is required to tell _why_ they are nouns, and to
write others, till he recognizes the noun wherever it is found.

The same course is then taken with reference to the verb, after which
_sentences_ are introduced in their simplest form, containing only the
essential elements, and the pupil is required to analyze them and
_construct_ similar sentences.

Then follows the adjective, and attention is called to its effect on the
meaning of the sentence. The _statement_ at the head of each section is
not to be committed to memory, but is made to assist the pupil in
appreciating the _grammatical forms of the sentences_ which follow. In
this manner, by the introduction of a new class of words, or the use of
the same class in a different relation, the sentence is _gradually built
up_; till, from the most simple, we have the most complex an involved
forms. The _technical terms_, denoting the various relations and
modifications, are then given, with marginal references to the
illustrations. The _definitions_ and _rules_ in the Sequel are deduced
from illustrations in the First Part.

The First Part of this Grammar has one _peculiar_ advantage. It combines
CONSTRUCTION with Analysis. On every principle developed, _written_
exercises are required of the pupils, not only to insure an understanding
of that particular principle and to perpetuate a knowledge of it, but also
to furnish gradual and continued practice in the _construction_ of
sentences. This method of instruction makes _correct writers_, as it
regards the using of words _understandingly_ and _grammatically_ in
sentences, and prepares the pupil for the task of _composition_, by
enabling him to express his thoughts _correctly_ if _he has_ any.

Persons who wish to acquire a knowledge of English Grammar +WITHOUT A
MASTER+, will find these works of great service. Sent singly or
together, by mail, post-paid, on receipt of price.

MAYHEW'S BOOK-KEEPING.


A PRACTICAL SYSTEM OF BOOK-KEEPING BY SINGLE AND DOUBLE ENTRY. BY IRA
MAYHEW, A. M. FOR FARMERS, MECHANICS, AND MERCHANTS.

This is a very neat-looking volume, whose title, "Practical Book-keeping,"
is indicative of its leading characteristics. The specimens of accounts
presented in it are in script that closely resembles writing, and they
hence afford excellent models for imitation. The book contains four forms
of accounts, immediately following each of which is a large number of
examples for practice. In their solution, the pupil has occasion
practically to apply the knowledge he has already acquired of both
arithmetic and penmanship, while at the same time he learns Book-keeping
as he will have occasion to practice it in after life. For this purpose a
set of account books, in which the examples for practice are to be written
out by the learner, and a Key for teachers containing the solution,
accompany the book.

Agesilaus, king of Sparta, being asked what things he thought most proper
for boys to learn, very appropriately replied, "Those things which they
should _practice_ when they become men." Ever since it was said to Adam,
"In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread," there has been a
necessity laid upon man not only to _labor,_ but to _exchange_ with others
the products of his industry, in order to secure a comfortable support.
Excepting merchants, mechanics, and professional men, very few,
comparatively, keep any accounts. The principal reason for this is found
in the fact, that when young they were not taught how to do so, and the
necessity of its being done. Considerations are presented, in the
Introduction to this work, to show some of the many advantages that would
result to individuals and to the community from making Book-keeping a
common study, and the design of the present work is to furnish a practical
system of popular Book-keeping, which may meet the wants of the great
majority of the American people.

noticed, with the date at which it happened. There has also been added a
large and beautiful Map of the ROMAN EMPIRE, which will be of use in the
study of Ancient Geography and History, most of the towns mentioned being
laid down on this Map.

The descriptions of the States and Territories are full and complete,
having been brought up to the times in every respect. This work is
rendered still more valuable by a complete

treatises of this subject. A series of DRILL QUESTIONS for General
Revision is appended to this work, which will be found of great
convenience to the Teacher and aid to the Scholar in bringing definitely
to his mind, in a condensed form, the main features of the subject he has
gone over. This Book is receiving universal favor where it is known by
Teachers, Committees, and others. It has been introduced into the Best
Schools of our country, and they cannot be without it.

  ELOCUTION MADE EASY.
  CONTAINING
  RULES AND SELECTIONS
  FOR
  DECLAMATION AND READING,
  WITH
  FIGURES ILLUSTRATIVE OF GESTURE, ETC.

BY RUFUS CLAGGETT, A. M.

This book is given to the public with a view to encourage the study and
practice of a branch of education which gives a tenfold vigor to all other
intellectual acquirements. Thousands of men, otherwise well educated, are
often heard to lament their neglect of Elocution in their school-boy days,
and their consequent inability to utter in public those thoughts which
they would gladly disseminate, and thereby confer a benefit on society.

The Selections in this work are principally from standard American
authors, and contain everything which can ennoble the mind and fill it
with exalted ideas of patriotism and virtue. At the same time, the price
of the book is so low that it can be placed in the hands of every pupil,
where, indeed, we are confident it will shortly find its way.


NOTICES.

_From the Brooklyn Evening Star._

Mr. Claggett, the author of this work on Elocution, has well performed his
task, giving evidence on every page of his familiarity with the subject.
He has prepared several rules easily understood and applied, and appended
forty-eight figures illustrative of gestures. The selections, both in
prose and poetry, are carefully made with reference to the object of the
work. We should like to see the work in daily use in our schools.

_From the New-York Express._

The whole theory and practice of the art of Elocution is so dissected and
simplified, that the pupil cannot fail to get a thorough understanding of
the subject.

"To just such instructions as he meets with in this work, is the writer of
this paragraph indebted for his own advancement from the journeyman's rank
to the position he now occupies. The winter evenings spent in pursuing
such studies, would fit many a man, now skilful as a workman, to take a
higher stand among his associates, and a more useful one in the community.
The whole book, which has been a very expensive one to get up, does great
credit to the publishers, and when known generally, cannot but receive a
cordial welcome from that valuable class of men to whom we are indebted
for the shelter afforded by 'the house we live in.'"

All persons who may wish to see their PORTRAITS TRUE TO LIFE, will do well
to call at his Gallery, and procure one of these new glass pictures known
as

AMBROTYPES.

The perfection to which this Art is brought, has induced the Subscriber to
bestow more than usual pains on this branch of Photography, and he is now
without a rival in the profession.

These AMBROTYPES are sealed with a durable cement, which renders them
perfectly impervious to air, and even water itself. They are therefore

IMPERISHABLE.

This fact alone will recommend them before all other pictures taken by the
Sun's rays, added to which is their wonderful truthfulness, being taken
without reversal as in the ordinary Daguerreotype, and capable of being
viewed in any angle of light.

PHOTOGRAPHS

Taken in Colors--of various sizes up to the SIZE OF LIFE.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
