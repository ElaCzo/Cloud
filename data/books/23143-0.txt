SANCTI HILARII

EPISTOLA AD ABRAM FILIAM SUAM.

(Circa Finem Anni 558 Missa.)


Dilectissimæ filiæ[a] Abræ Hilarius in Domino salutem.

1. _Abra patris absentiam dolet._--Accepi litteras tuas, in quibus
intelligo desiderantem te mei esse: et certum (_Mss._ certe) ita habeo.
Sentio enim quantum præsentia horum qui amantur optabilis sit. Et quia
gravem tibi esse absentiam meam scirem, ne me forte impium esse erga te
existimares, qui tam diu a te abessem: excusare tibi et profectionem
meam et moras volui, ut intelligeres me non impie tibi, sed utiliter
deesse. Namque cum te, filia, ut unicam, ita, quantum a me est, et
unanimem habeam; vellem te pulcherrimam omnium et sanissimam vivere.

2. _Hilarius abest, ut vestem et margaritam pretiosam filiæ
conquirat._--Nuntiatum ergo mihi est, esse quemdam juvenem, habentem
margaritam et vestem inæstimabilis pretii: quam si quis ab eo posset
mereri, super humanas divitias et salutem et dives et salvus fieret. Ad
hunc[b] his auditis profectus sum: ad quem cum per multas et longas et
difficiles vias venissem, videns eum statim procidi. Adest enim tam
pulcher juvenis, ut ante conspectum ejus nemo audeat consistere. Qui ubi
me procidisse vidit, interrogari me jussit quid vellem, et quid rogarem:
et ego respondi, audisse me de veste sua et margarita, et ob id venisse;
et si eam mihi dignaretur præstare, esse mihi filiam quam vehementer
diligerem, cui hanc vestem atque margaritam quærerem. Et[c] inter hæc
prostratus in faciem fleo plurimum, et noctibus ac diebus ingemiscens,
rogo uti audire dignaretur precem meam.

3. _Vestis hæc et margarita quanti facienda._--Post quæ, quia bonus est
juvenis et[d] melius illo nihil est, ait mihi, Nosti hanc vestem atque
hanc margaritam, quam a me lacrymis rogas uti eam filiæ tuæ concedam? Et
ego respondi illi, Domine, auditu cognovi de ipsis, et fide credidi: et
scio quia optimæ sunt, et salus vera est hac veste uti, et hac margarita
ornari. Et statim ministris suis præcepit, ut mihi et vestem hanc et
margaritam ostenderent: et confestim ita fit. Ac vestem primo vidi:
vidi, filia, vidi quod eloqui non possum. Numquid non sericum secundum
subtilitatem ejus[e] spartum erat? Numquid candori ejus nives comparatæ
non nigrescebant? Numquid aurum juxta fulgorem ejus non lividatur? Ipsa
enim multicolor, et nihil prorsus comparatum ei poterat æquari. Post
quam vidi margaritam: qua visa statim concidi. Non enim potuerunt oculi
mei sustinere tantum ejus colorem. Nam nec cœli, nec lucis, nec maris,
nec terræ species pulcritudini ejus poterat comparari.

4. _Utriusque commoda et dotes._--Et cum prostratus jacerem, ait mihi
quidam de assistentibus, Video te sollicitum et bonum patrem esse, et
hanc vestem atque hanc margaritam ad filiam tuam desiderare: sed ut
magis desideres, ostendo tibi quid adhuc hæc vestis atque margarita boni
habeat. Vestis hæc numquam tineis comeditur, non usu atteritur, non
sorde inficitur, non vi scinditur, non damno amittitur: sed semper talis
qualis est permanet. Margaritæ vero hæc virtus est, ut si quis eam
induerit, non ægrotet, non senescat, non moriatur. Nihil omnino in se
habet, quod sit[f] noxium corpori: sed utenti ea nihil accidit, quod aut
mortem afferat, aut ætatem demutet, aut impediat sanitatem. Quod ubi
audivi, filia, exanimari magis desiderio margaritæ et vestis istius
cœpi: et sicut prostratus jacebam, indeficienti fletu et intenta
oratione juvenem precari cœpi, dicens: Domine sancte, miserere preci
meæ, et miserere sollicitudini et vitæ meæ. Si enim hanc vestem mihi et
margaritam non concedis, miser futurus sum, filiamque meam[g] viventem
perditurus: ego propter hanc vestem et margaritam peregrinari volo.
Scis, Domine, quia tibi non mentior.

    [+527+]

5. _Hilarii filiæ promittuntur, modo vana ornamenta abjiciat._--Post
quam vocem meam audivit, jubet me levare; et ait mihi, moverunt me
preces et lacrymæ tuæ, et bene est quod hoc credidisti. Et quia dixisti,
te pro hac margarita ipsam vitam tuam velle impendere, non possum eam
tibi negare: sed scire debes propositum et voluntatem meam. Vestis, quam
ego dedero, talis est, ut[h] si quis voluerit veste alia colorata et
serica et aurata uti, vestem meam capere non possit. Sed illi dabo eam,
quæ contenta sit, non serico habitu, sed[i] nativis coloribus et
insumptuoso textu vestiri: ita ut propter consuetudinem, purpuram[k]
perangustam vestis habeat: non etiam purpura ipsa[l] diffundatur in
vestem. Margarita vero, quam a me petis, naturæ ejus est, ut habere eam
nemo possit, qui margaritam aliam habuerit: quia aliæ margaritæ aut de
terra aut de mari sunt; mea autem, ut ipse tu vides, speciosa et
pretiosa est, incomparabilis et cœlestis est, nec dignatur ibi esse ubi
aliæ sunt. Non enim rebus meis convenit cum rebus hominis: quia qui
veste mea et margarita utitur, in æternum sanus est; non febre
exardescit, non vulneri patet, non annis demutatur, non morte
dissolvitur;[m] æqualis enim semper et æternus est. Ego tamen hanc
vestem et hanc margaritam meam petenti tibi dabo, ut eam filiæ tuæ
perferas. Sed prius scire debes quid velit filia tua. Si se hujus vestis
et margaritæ meæ dignam faciat, id est, si vestes sericas et auratas et
infectas habere noluerit, si omnem margaritam alteram oderit; tunc hæc
quæ me rogas tibi præstabo.

6. _Filiam hortatur ut modestis utatur vestibus._--Post quam vocem,
filia, lætus exsurgo, et secretum hoc habens, hanc ad te epistolam feci:
rogans te per multas lacrymas meas, ut te huic vesti et margaritæ
reserves, neque miserum senem tali damno tuo[n] facias, si hanc vestem
et hanc margaritam non habueris. Testor[o] autem tibi, filia, Deum cœli
et terræ, quia nihil hac veste atque hac margarita pretiosius est; et
tui juris est, ut hanc habeas. Tu modo,[p] si quando tibi vestis alia
afferatur, vel serica, vel infecta, vel deaurata, dicito ei qui tibi
offert: Ego vestem alteram exspecto, propter quam pater meus a me tam
diu peregrinatur, quam mihi quærit, quam non possum habere si hanc
habuero. Sufficit mihi lana ovis meæ, sufficit mihi color quem natura
attulit, sufficit mihi textus insumptuosus: cæterum vestem illam
desidero, quæ dicitur non absumi, non atteri, non scindi. At vero si
tibi margarita offeratur aut suspendenda collo, aut digito coaptanda,
dices ita, Non mihi impedimento sint istæ inutiles et sordidæ margaritæ:
sed exspecto illam pretiosissimam, pulcherrimam et utilissimam. Credo
patri meo, quia et[q] ille ei, qui hanc spopondit sibi, credidit,
propter quam mihi significavit se etiam mori velle: hanc exspecto, hanc
desidero, quæ mihi præstabit salutem et æternitatem.

    [hanc margaritam +528+ non habueris.]

7. _Filiæ exspectat rescriptum. Hymnus matutinus et serotinus. Abræ
mater._--Ergo, filia, subveni sollicitudini meæ, et hanc epistolam meam
semper lege, et huic vesti et margaritæ te reserva. Et ipsa tu mihi,
nullum interrogans, quibuslibet potes litteris rescribe, utrum vesti
huic et margaritæ te reserves, ut sciam quid juveni illi respondeam:
et ut si illam desideras, si exspectas, lætus possim ad te reditum
cogitare. Cum autem mihi rescripseris, tunc tibi et ego quis sit hic
juvenis, et qualis sit, et quid velit, et quid promittat, et quid
possit, indicabo. Interim tibi hymnum matutinum et serotinum misi, ut
memor mei semper sis. Tu vero si minus per ætatem hymnum et epistolam
intellexeris, interroga matrem tuam, quæ optat ut te moribus suis
genuerit Deo. Deus qui te genuit, hic et in æternum custodiat opto,
filia desideratissima.

    ulciscitur Christus violatores templi sui, sic gemmas et
    pretiosissima ornamenta defendit._ Quod autem ibi de virginum
    cultu habet, maxime vero illud, _Habeat alias margaritas, quibus

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
