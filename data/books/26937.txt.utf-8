INTRODUCTION


This syllabus, or finding-list, is offered to lovers of folk-literature
in the hope that it may not be without interest and value to them for
purposes of comparison and identification. It includes 333 items,
exclusive of 114 variants, and embraces all popular songs that have so
far come to hand as having been "learned by ear instead of by eye," as
existing through oral transmission--song-ballads, love-songs,
number-songs, dance-songs, play-songs, child-songs, counting-out rimes,
lullabies, jigs, nonsense rimes, ditties, etc.

There is every reason to believe that many more such await the
collector; in fact, their number is constantly being increased even
today by the creation of new ones, by adaptation of the old, and even by
the absorption and consequent metamorphosis, of literary,
quasi-literary, or pseudo-literary types into the current of oral
tradition.

This collection, then, is by no means complete: means have not been
available for a systematic and scientific search for these folk-songs,
which have been gathered very casually during the past five years
through occasional travel, acquaintanceship, and correspondence in only
the twenty-one following counties: Fayette, Madison, Rowan, Elliott,
Carter, Boyd, Lawrence, Morgan, Johnson, Pike, Knott, Breathitt, Clay,
Laurel, Rockcastle, Garrard, Boyle, Anderson, Shelby, Henry, and
Owen--all lying in Central and Eastern Kentucky.

All of the material listed has thus been collected in this State, though
a variant of The Jew's Daughter, page 8, has come by chance from
Michigan, and another of The Pretty Mohee, page 12, was sent from
Georgia. The Cumberland Mountain region, in the eastern part of the
State, has naturally furnished the larger half of the material, because
of local conditions favorable to the propagation of folk-song. However,
sections of Kentucky lying farther to the westward are almost equally
prolific. The wide extension of the same ballad throughout the State
argues convincingly for the unity of the Kentucky stock--a fact which
may be confirmed in more ways than one.

The arrangement is as follows: The material in hand is loosely grouped
in eighteen sections, according to origin, chronology, content, or form.
Though logically at fault, because of the cross-division thus inevitably
entailed, this plan has seemed to be the best. No real confusion will
result to the user in consequence. In fact, no matter what system be
adopted, certain songs will belong equally well to two or more different
categories.

Under each of these eighteen main divisions the treatment of the
individual song-ballad is in general as follows: First, stands the
title, with variant titles in parentheses. Should this be unknown, a
caption coined by the editors is placed in brackets. Secondly, a Roman
numeral immediately follows the above to denote the number of versions,
if variants have been found. Thirdly, the prosodical character of the
song is roughly indicated by a combination of letters and numerals. Each
letter indicates a line; the variation in the letters indicates, in the
usual fashion, the rime-scheme of the stanza. Each numeral indicates the
number of stresses in the line (or lines) denoted by the letter (or
letters) immediately succeeding it. When a chorus, burden, or refrain is
present, the metrical scheme of this stands immediately after an "and,"
as, for example, in The Blue and the Gray, page 14. In the case of the
refrain, the letters used are independent of those immediately preceding
the "and," and denoting the rime-scheme of the stanza proper. Fourthly,
an Arabic numeral follows to indicate the number of stanzas in the song,
exclusive of the refrain, should one be present. If the number of
stanzas in a ballad is indeterminable, because its form is fragmentary,
or because its variant versions differ in length, this fact is indicated
by an appended ca (_circa_). Sixth, and last, is a synopsis, or other
attempt to give briefly such data as may serve to complete the
identification.

Illustration of the third item above may be helpful. Thus in Pretty
Polly, on page 7, 4aabb indicates a quatrain riming in couplets, with
four stresses in each line. In Jackaro, page 9, 3abcb indicates a
quatrain riming alternately, with three stressed syllables in each line.
In The King's Daughter, page 7, 4a3b4c3b indicates a quatrain, with only
the second and fourth lines riming and with four stresses in the first
and third lines and three stresses in the second and fourth. In Johnnie
Came from Sea, page 14, 6aa denotes a rimed couplet, with six stresses
in each line.

It has, naturally, been difficult at times to decide whether certain
stanzas should be counted as couplets, or as quatrains half as long. In
such cases, the air, or tune, and other data, often rather subtle, have
been employed in making decisions. The quatrain form has in uncertain
instances been given the benefit of the doubt. Even thus, certain minor
inconsistencies will perhaps be noted. It is hardly necessary to add
that assonance freely occurs in the place of rime, and as such it is
considered throughout.

All attempt to indicate the prevailing metrical unit, or foot, within
the line has been frankly given over. Iambs, dactyls, and their ilk
receive scant courtesy from the composer of folk-song, who without qualm
or quaver will stretch one syllable, or even an utter silence (caesura),
into the time of a complete bar; while in the next breath he will with
equal equanimity huddle a dozen syllables into the same period.
Consequently, this item, even if it could be indicated, would have scant
descriptive value.

It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge gratefully the assistance of those
who have transmitted to our hands many of the songs: Mesdames J. W.
Combs, W. T. Phillips, Jennie L. Combs, Richard Smith, Martha Smith,
Ruth Hackney, W. F. Hays, Ollie Huff, Robin Cornett, Lucy Banks, Sarah
Burton, Kittie Jordan, and Ruby Martin; Misses Martha Jent, Maud Dean,
Virginia Jordan, Jessie Green, Lizzie Cody, Margaret Combs, Barbara
Smith, Helena E. Rose, Sarah Burton, Sarah Hillman, Cordia Bramblett,
Nannie S. Graham, Myrtle Wheeler, Melissa Holbrook, Rosetta Wheeler,
Ruth Hackney, Ora McDavid, Jeannette McDavid; Messrs. Wm. W. Berry,
Chas. Hackney, S. B. Wheeler, R. L. Morgan, Enoch Wheeler, Thos. H.
Hackney, James Goodman, W. S. Wheeler, Harry M. Morgan, Henry Lester, T.
G. Wheeler, C. F. Bishop, and John C. Jones.

Especially helpful as collaborators have been Messrs. Winfred Cox, Emory
E. Wheeler, Roud Shaw, A. B. Johnston, C. E. Phillips, and H.
Williamson.

Kind words or letters of appreciation and, in some cases, of suggestion,
from the following have encouraged the preparation of this syllabus:
Professors Alexander S. Mackenzie, of the Kentucky State University;
Clarence C. Freeman, of Transylvania University; John A. Lomax, of the
University of Texas; Albert H. Tolman, of the University of Chicago;
John M. McBride, Jr., of the University of the South; George Lyman
Kittredge, of Harvard University; Henry M. Belden, of the University of
Missouri; and Katherine Jackson, formerly of Bryn Mawr College, who has
most generously given the use of her manuscript collection. None of the
shortcomings of this brochure, however, can be imputed to them in the
slightest degree.

FAIR NOTAMON [NOTTINGHAM] TOWN, 4aabb, 7: An absurd recital, full of

American colonial times. For most of them it is fair to infer a British
origin._

[TO AMERICA], ii, 4aabb, 8ca: An [English] sailor, bound for America to

A passing ship carries them back to London, and they are married.

THE PRETTY MOHEE (MAUMEE), iii, 4aabb, 7: An Indian maid falls in love

ROVING IRISH BOY, 4a3b4c3b, 12: He lands in Philadelphia and "makes a

Bucks County, he meets an inn-keeper's daughter, and leaves off
rambling.

THE WAXFORD GIRL, 4a3b4c3b, 6: A youth murders his sweetheart and throws

IRISH GIRL, a fragment, as follows:

     So costly were the robes of silk
     The Irish girl did wear--

_Here are grouped songs whose main theme is love, subdivided as below.

_This group consists of humorous songs. Certain ones resemble modern
songs of the vaudeville, and such they probably were._

GRANDMOTHER'S MUSTARD PLASTER, 4aabb, 7ca: The story of a plaster that
drew the buttons from a vest, axles from a wagon, a street car forty
miles, jerked a "Chinee's" boot off and pulled his leg at the "opium
jint," mashed a "cop's" hat down, drew a wagon over town, stuck on a
passenger train, drew it to Washington, where it remained--stuck on
politics.

BOY AND BUMBLE-BEE, 4a3b4c3b(?), 5: An urchin puts a bumble-bee in his
pistol pocket and goes fishing. He sits down, the bee turns the trick,
and "spoils the urchin's disposition."

KATE AND THE CLOTHIER, 4aabb, 8ca: A jilted maiden disguises herself in
"an old cowhide with crooked horns," and seizes her clothier-lover in a
"lonesome field." Thinking her to be the Devil, he renounces the
lawyer's daughter and pledges his troth to Kate.

SEYMORE WILSON, 3a3b4c3b, 8ca: He is a gawky, love-sick youth. He goes
a-courting on Potriffle, but finding a rival sitting on the
"calico-side" returns to his plowing, weeps, then becomes cheerful in
his resolve to wait for another girl.

BILLY BOY, ii, 4a3b4c3b, 7: He replies to a series of questions about
his wife: she is "too young to leave her mammy," can "bake a
cherry-pie," is "as tall as a pine and as straight as a pumpkin-vine,"
is "twice six times seven, twice twenty and eleven," and so on.

[THE PREACHER AND THE BEAR], a chant of the 4a3b4c3b type, 7ca: He goes
hunting a-Sunday, meets a grizzly bear, climbs a tree, and prays a
humorous prayer for help. The limb breaks; he falls, but escapes.

[LOVE IS SUCH A FUNNY THING], 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e and 4a3b4c3b, 9: It
causes empty pockets, second-hand clothing, collectors, and even brings
the "bald-headed end of the broom" into play: a husband's soliloquy.

[THE MARRIED MAN], 4aa, 5: A married man's woes: children on his knees,
bad clothing, "seeping" shoes--while the single man suffers none of
these things.

DEVILISH MARY, 4a3b4c3b, 5: A hen-pecked husband's lament: he woos and
marries the termagant within three days--then follows trouble. She
"mashes his mouth with a shovel," bundles up her "duds", and leaves him
within three weeks.

I WON'T MARRY AT ALL, 4aab3b and 4aab3b, 3: I won't marry a rich man
because he will drink and fall in the ditch; a poor man, for he will go
begging; a fat man, for he will do nothing but "nurse" the cat.

POOR OLD MAID, metre as below, 5: She laments her virginity:

     Dressed in yaller, pink, and blue--
             Poor old maid!
     Dressed in yaller, pink, and blue,
     I'm just as sweet as the morning dew,
     And to a husband I'd stick like glue--
             Poor old maid!

I WISH I WAS SINGLE AGAIN, metre as below, 5: A married man's
repentance: his first wife died--

     I married me another, O then, O then;
     I married me another O then;
     I married me another, the Devil's grandmother,
     And I wish I was single again.

JOE BOWERS, 3abcb, 10: He leaves his sweetheart, Sally Black, in Pike
County, Missouri, and goes to "Rome," California, to make a home for
her. Later, he receives a letter from his brother Ike saying that she
had married a red-headed butcher and that their baby had red hair.

A POUND OF TOW, 3abcded, 4: A husband warns all bachelors by the example
of his own wife, who, though a good spinner before her marriage, has
since become a gad-about and a gossip.


XIV.

_The songs of this group, in lieu of a better caption, may be called
sentimental._

THE BLIND CHILD, iii, 4a3b4c3b, 11ca: She deplores her father's second
marriage, kneels to say her evening prayers, and dies. She is buried by
the side of her mother.

THE DYING NUN, 4abcb, 12: To Sister Martha, her nurse, Sister Clara
tells her youthful waywardness toward her parents and recalls her early
love for Douglas, and dies.

THE SHIP THAT NEVER RETURNED, 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e, 6: The vanity of human
wishes: a feeble lad kissing his mother good-bye as he sets sail to seek
health in a foreign climate; a gallant seaman kissing his wife good-bye
as he sets sail to seek their fortune across the seas--but the ship of
either never returned.

I HAVE NO MOTHER NOW, 3abab, 9: An orphan's lament, with a vision of the
mother's grave, etc.

THE ORPHAN GIRL, 4a3b4c3b, 8: Refused shelter at the door of a rich man
one wintry night, she dies before it in the snow.

PHANTOM FOOTSTEPS, 4ababcdcd and 4abab, 3: A mother's night-yearning for
her dead child.

[THE WAYWARD GIRL], 4aa6b4cc6b4dd6e4ff6e and 4ab2cc4bde2ff4e, 2: One
year after leaving her home in wayward love, her father writes her of
her mother's death and forgives her, but she refuses to return.

OLD MAN'S TROUBLE, 4aa5b4cc5b and 4aa5b4cc5b, 3: A meditation upon the
sadness of old age and a warning to the young against their own days of
poverty and senile helplessness.

IN THE BAGGAGE-COACH AHEAD, iii, 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e4g3h4i3h and 4aabb, 2:
A crying child brings to its sad-eyed father remonstrances from sleepy
passengers until they are told that the dead mother is in the
baggage-coach ahead.

OLD CHURCH-YARD, 4abcb, 7: A forlorn orphan's meditation upon her
mother's grave.


XV.

_The songs of this group, in lieu of a more accurate name, may be called
moralities, since they contain a moral incident or reflection._

[THE BLACK SHEEP], 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e and 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e, 6: Jack and
Tom prevail upon their rich and aged father to send away their brother
Fred as a "black sheep." Later, just as these two Pharisees are about to
send the old man to the poorhouse, Fred reappears and saves him from
this disgrace.

[NOTHING TO BE MADE BY ROVING], 3abcb, 2: Dissipation brings discontent
at last.

TWO DRUMMERS, 6aabbccdd and 6aabb, 2: In a "grand hotel" they speak
slightingly to a pretty waitress. She rebukes them, making appeal to
their regard for their mothers. They apologize to her and one of them
marries her.

THE DRUNKARD'S DREAM, ii, 4a3b4c3b, 9: A vision of his dead wife and
children turns him from strong drink forever after.

FATHER, DEAR FATHER, COME HOME WITH ME NOW, 4a3b4c3b4d3e4f3e and
3a3b4c3b, 3: The little daughter begs her father to come home from the
grog-shop before her little brother dies. The clock tolls twelve, one,
two, three--and when finally she leads him home, the boy is dead.

A DRIFTER RESCUED, 4abcb, 10: The turbulent journey of a ship-wrecked
soul: near the brink of destruction the reckless man finds a redeemer in
the Savior.

THE WANDERING BOY, 4aabb and 4abcc, 4: A mother's wail for her wayward
son: she points out the vacant chair, cradle, and shoes of his innocent
babyhood.


XVI.

_This group contains sequence-songs, or number-songs, like the popular
German Zaehllieder, though not all are necessarily sung, but rather are
spoken. The first one below would seem to be akin to the various cabala
of the German Pietists of Pennsylvania._

[TWELVE APOSTLES], as follows:

     Twelve, twelve apostles,
     Eleven, eleven, I went to heaven,
     Ten, ten, commandments,
     Nine bright lights a-shining,
     Eight Gabel [Gabriel?] angels,
     Seven stars a-hanging high,
     Six, six go acymord,
     Five all alone abroard,
     Four scorn in Wackford,

THE UNLUCKY YOUNG MAN, ii, 4aa and 4aaa3b, 13ca: He exchanges oxen for a

down the house."

OLD SAM SUCK-EGG, ii, 2aa, 10: He swaps his wife for a duck-egg, and

     Jolly is the miller that lives by the mill,

     One hand in the hopper and the other in the sack--
     The boys step forward and the girls step back.

SISTER PHOEBE, 4aab, 2: It begins:

     Old sister Phoebe, how happy were we

     The juniper tree, heigh ho, heigh ho.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
