The position of eminence, the great respect and the profound reverence
in which the name of WASHINGTON is enshrined in the hearts of the
American people, and particularly so, with the members of this
Fraternity, and of all true lovers of liberty and freedom wheresoever
dispersed, is the reason, if any be needed, why everything relating to
this great man and worthy brother should be preserved for the future
generations, to be used by them as a guide, in the cultivation of those
cardinal virtues of Honor and Integrity, that should ever characterize
the conduct of a good man and a good Mason.

The collection and reproduction of the letters of Brother WASHINGTON,
together with the text of this book, have been prepared under my
supervision, and its publication is heartily approved.

FOREWORD


WASHINGTON's Masonic correspondence as found among the Washington papers
in the Manuscript department of the Library of Congress, affords an
insight of the great esteem in which WASHINGTON held the Masonic
Fraternity, of which since his early days he had been an honored member.

This is further shown by his great courtesy to the Brethren, in his
replies to their addresses, no matter whether they were from a Grand or
Subordinate Lodge. In this collection, were also found some of the
original drafts of WASHINGTON's replies, together with copies of the
various masonic addresses and letters to him, and in the case of Dominie
Snyder, press copies of his answers.

In the present work an attempt has been made to group this matter
together in chronological order, also to show some of the surroundings
and conditions under which this correspondence was made, and of the
Brethren who were prominent in the presentation of these Eleven
Addresses, which came to him from Seven of the Thirteen Colonies.

A complete set of photostatic fac-similes of these documents in the
Library of Congress, has been secured for the Museum of the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania. Efforts were also made to obtain photographic copies of
such of the WASHINGTON Masonic letters as were still in existence, which
were successful except in two instances as noted in the text.

It will be noted that on April 30, 1789, WASHINGTON, while Master of his
Lodge, was inaugurated President of the United States; this is the only
instance where one of the fourteen Presidents, who were Members of our
Fraternity was a Master of a Lodge during their term as President.

The esteem in which WASHINGTON held the Masonic Fraternity, is shown by
the fact, that in almost every case he had both the address and his
reply, copied upon opposite pages of one of his folio letter-books, now
in the Library of Congress. These copies are respectively in the
handwriting of WASHINGTON's private secretaries, viz:--Major William
Jackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G. W. Craik.

In addition to the above copies we have WASHINGTON's original drafts of
his letters to Watson and Cassoul, to the Grand Lodges of Massachusetts,
South Carolina, and Maryland, to Paul Revere, and as before stated
press copies of his answers to Mr. Snyder.

A perusal of these original documents, as here presented, affords an
excellent illustration of the _entente cordiale_, which existed between
WASHINGTON and his Masonic Brethren.

Upon the other hand, how the Masonic Fraternity, during WASHINGTON's
lifetime, venerated their august Brother, is shown by the addresses of
this correspondence as retained by WASHINGTON.

Also by the various Masonic Memorial services held, after WASHINGTON's
death, the chief of which was in Philadelphia, under the auspices of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The Masonic services held in every State of
the Union, the many Eulogies and Sermons delivered and printed are
matters of history.

How this veneration of the great WASHINGTON continued during the past
years, is shown by the fact that there are no less than 53 Masonic
Lodges in the United States, named after the illustrious Brother. This
is independent of the numerous Royal Arch Chapters, Commanderies, and
other Masonic bodies, that bear the name "WASHINGTON."

Washington Lodges are found in thirty-eight of the forty-eight States of
the American Union.

The other ten States, which thus far have no "Washington Lodge" within
their Jurisdiction, are Mississippi and Texas, together with the newer
western States lately admitted into the American Union, viz:--Nevada,
North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.

In addition to the fifty-three Washington Lodges, there is also one each
in Canada, the Island of Cuba and the District of Columbia.

In the Masonic Fraternity throughout the world, the name of WASHINGTON
is ever kept in remembrance, as one of the brightest luminaries in the
Masonic constellation, one of the most prominent examples, being his
full length oil portrait in Masonic clothing in the Hall of the Grand
Lodge of England at London.

Acknowledgments are due to the Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of
Congress, for placing these documents at the disposal of the writer, and
giving permission to have photostat copies made of same; also to J.
Henry Williams, Esq., R. W. Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania and
Masonic Jurisdiction thereunto belonging, for suggestions and
encouragement in the preparation of this work.

  PHILADELPHIA, FEBRUARY 22, A.D. 1915--A.L. 5915.




The Masonic Correspondence of Washington


Much has been written pro and con about WASHINGTON and his connection
with the Masonic Fraternity. Thus far no complete set of his Masonic
writings have been compiled or published. Such portions as have been
printed were fragmentary, and issued for what may be called local
purposes.

How careful WASHINGTON was of his Masonic correspondence is shown by the
fact that he had copies made, in his private letter books, of most all
letters sent him by the various Masonic Grand and Subordinate bodies,
and his answers thereto, usually upon opposite pages. He thus had both
the addresses and his reply at hand for easy reference. This fact shows
the esteem in which WASHINGTON held his Brethren of the Masonic
Fraternity, as well as his own opinion of Freemasonry.

These letter-books are now in the Library of Congress, and photostat
copies of such as relate to Freemasonry have been made for the Library
of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.

As to the authenticity of the Washington Letter Books, and how they came
into the possession of the United States Government is explained by the
following statement by Mr. Galliard Hunt, chief Manuscript division,
Library of Congress:[1]

     "They are a part of the Washington papers in
     "the Government's possession, purchased from the
     "Washington family, one lot in 1834 and the re-
     "mainder in 1849, and deposited in the Department
     "of State until 1903, when, by the President's order,
     "they were sent to this Library. They range in date
     "from 1754 to 1799. Some of them are partly
     "or wholly in Washington's hand-writing, and others
     "in the writing of his secretaries and their clerks.
     "There are no volumes of press copies, but there are
     "some press copies among the papers."


WASHINGTON in writing his answer to the various greetings, in most cases
would first make a rough copy of his reply, then digest, alter, correct
or change such parts or sentences as he thought proper. Then after
deliberate consideration, a fair copy would be made either by WASHINGTON
or one of his Secretaries and signed by him, and sent to the Masonic
bodies for which they were intended.

Fortunately some of the original drafts of these Masonic letters have
come down to us; thus far five autographic copies have been found among
the Washington papers in the Library of Congress at Washington.

1. Draft of letter written at Newburg, New York, August 19, 1782, to
Watson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, thanking them for the Masonic
Apron, embroidered by the nuns at Nantes, and which is now in possession
of Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.

2. To the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.

3. To the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.

4. To the Grand Lodge of South Carolina.

5. To the Grand Lodge of Maryland; this draft is a two-page letter
written upon a letter sheet and shows many changes and corrections; it
is dated 1798.

In addition to the above original drafts there were found several
addresses and the accompanying answers, which thus far have never been
published, in fact no mention of them has ever appeared in print, viz:--

1. An address from the Grand Lodge of Georgia, together with
WASHINGTON's reply.

2. A letter to Paul Revere, Grand Master of Massachusetts and his Grand
Officers.

3. An address from the Brethren of Prince George's Lodge, No. 16,
Georgetown, South Carolina, presented to President WASHINGTON during his
visit to South Carolina, April 30, 1791, also his reply to same.

4. An address from the Brethren of St. John's Lodge, No. 2, of Newbern,
North Carolina, and the reply to same.

Photostat copies of the above have also been obtained which make the
most complete collection of the Masonic Correspondence of WASHINGTON
which has thus far been compiled.

A careful study of this correspondence so carefully cherished by
WASHINGTON puts an entirely new phase upon WASHINGTON's connection with
the Masonic Fraternity, and his esteem of Freemasonry.

These papers absolutely thrust aside all of the statements, arguments
and libels, brought forth by our misguided enemies at the time of the
Anti-Masonic craze during the last century, and in a small way kept
alive even down to the present day by some people who are blinded by
their ignorance or malice.

Referring to some of their published statements that WASHINGTON never
belonged to the Masonic Fraternity, and that there were no authentic
Masonic letters nor copies thereof among his records so frequently made
during the political Anti-Masonic craze, which swept over New England
and the Middle States about eighty-five years ago, the following
quotations from the Masonic literature of the period will prove
interesting examples.

One of the chief statements made by these people, and brought before all
their conventions and heralded in the public prints was: "That though
General Washington caused to be carefully copied in books kept for that
purpose, all his letters on every subject, no trace whatever of any of
the five letters under consideration,[2] nor any letters to any other
Lodge or Masonic body whatever, are to be found among the records of his
correspondence."[3]

The chief authority upon whom the leaders of the Anti-Masonic movement
at that time depended in their defamation of WASHINGTON, was Jared
Sparks of Boston, who at the time was engaged writing a life of
WASHINGTON, and then had access to all the Washington letter-books and
papers, and from his connection with the Washington correspondence, was
supposed to be the best qualified to pass upon their authenticity.

Another of the charges made by the Anti-Masonic bigots whose chief
object was to controvert facts was:

     "That although WASHINGTON was _extremely scrupulous_ in preserving
     his correspondence with all public or private bodies, there is not
     a line of his _relating to Freemasonry_, to be found among all his
     papers, except the correspondence with Mr. Snyder![4] It is also a
     fact, that WASHINGTON was equally scrupulous in dating his letters,
     and it is believed that not one can be found, which is without a
     date."[5]


It appears that the chairman of a committee of citizens of Boston called
upon the officers of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to submit their
two Washington letters to Jared Sparks for his inspection. This the
Grand Officers refused to do.

In return Sparks sent the following letter to the Chairman:

     "Boston, February 18, 1833.

     "_Sir_,--I received this morning your letter of the 15th instant, in
     which you inquire:

     "Whether I have yet seen or had in my possession any original letter
     or letters, in the hand writing of General Washington, addressed to
     any body of men denominating themselves Freemasons.

     "In reply, I can only state that I have seen no letters from General
     Washington of the kind described in yours, nor received any
     communication on the subject, either verbal or written.[6]

        "I am, Sir,
          "Very respectfully,
            "Your ob't servant,
              "JARED SPARKS."


How Sparks could have overlooked the numerous entries in the letter
books whose numbers and folios are here quoted, also the drafts of
replies in WASHINGTON's hand-writing and signed by him (copies of which
are here given in this work), can only be accounted for by the fact that
he must have been carried away by the political excitement of the day.

WASHINGTON's connection with the Masonic Fraternity has been
exhaustively traced by Brother James M. Lamberton, Past Master of
Perseverance Lodge, No. 21, in his address "WASHINGTON AS A FREEMASON,"
from the day of his entrance into Fredericksburg Lodge, No. 4, of
Virginia, September 1, 1752, until the day of his death, December 14,
1799, before the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, at its celebration of the
Sesqui-Centennial Anniversary of the Initiation of Brother GEORGE
WASHINGTON into the Fraternity of Freemasons,[7] held in the Masonic
Temple, in the city of Philadelphia on Wednesday, November 5, 1902.

It must also be remembered that WASHINGTON made a public profession of
his membership in Philadelphia, Monday, December 28, 1778, when he
walked in procession with his brethren of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, from the College at Fourth and Arch Streets to Christ
Church on Second Street above Market Street, Philadelphia, where, after
a prayer by Rev. William White, a sermon was preached for the "[Benefit
of the POOR] by appointment of and before | The General Communication |
of | Free and Accepted | MASONS | of the | State of PENNSYLVANIA, | on
Monday, December 28, 1788, | Celebrated, agreeable to their
Constitution, | as the Anniversary of | ST. JOHN the Evangelist, | by
William Smith, D.D., | Provost of the College and Academy of
Philadelphia." |

This Sermon was printed and dedicated to Brother WASHINGTON and a copy
sent to him, which was bound with other pamphlets in a volume lettered
"Masonic Sermons," and is so mentioned in the inventory of his estate
and now in the Boston Athenæum.[8] At this service over four hundred
pounds were collected for the relief of the poor.

Rev. Brother William Smith, D.D., preached a number of Masonic Sermons
in Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland; three of which delivered at the
request of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania were printed, viz.:

_Sermon 1._--On Brotherly Love, &c. Preached on the Anniversary of St.
John the Baptist, June 24, 1755,

_Sermon 2._--Preached on Monday, December 28, 1778, celebrated as the
Anniversary of St. John the Evangelist. With an Appendix on the
Character of Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus,

_Sermon 3._--Preached before the Grand Lodge of Communication, on St.
John the Baptist's day, June 24, 1795.

Original copies of the above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.

Rev. Brother Smith reprinted the above in a Volume of Sermons with the
following note:[9]

    "N. B. The above three Sermons were preached at the request of the
    Grand Lodge of Communication, for Pennsylvania, and contains in
    substance all that the Author thinks it necessary to bequeath to the
    Brotherhood, by way of Sermons, preached at different times and in
    sundry of the neighboring States, during 48 Years past."


By referring to the following letters and Documents it is shown that
WASHINGTON's interest in Freemasonry and the Fraternity continued until
the time of his death.

These documents cover the period from 1782 to 1798.

As these copies in our possession are photostat fac-similes of the
original documents in the Library of Congress, there can never be any
question of correctness or of their authenticity.

The finding and collating of this material will settle for all time to
come the question of WASHINGTON's connection with the Ancient
Fraternity, and his opinion and esteem of Freemasonry.

The earliest record we have of any Masonic Body proposing a masonic
address to General WASHINGTON, was the resolution offered in King
David's Lodge, No. 1, at Newport, Rhode Island, during WASHINGTON's
visit to Newport in March, 1781, while the French Army under Rochambeau
was quartered there. WASHINGTON arrived in Newport on the sixth of March
and remained there until the thirteenth, when he left for Providence by
way of Bristol.

It was in anticipation of this visit that the Brethren of King David's
Lodge, of which Brother Moses Michael Hays[10] was Worshipful Master,
that a masonic greeting to General WASHINGTON was proposed. The
following entry from the old Minute Book of the Lodge will explain why
the project failed to materialize.


=MOSES M. HAYS

W. M. KING DAVID'S LODGE, No. 1, NEWPORT, R. I., 1780-1781. GRAND MASTER
OF MASONS IN MASSACHUSETTS, 1788-1793.=


    EXTRACT FROM THE RECORDS OF KING DAVID'S LODGE.

    "Regular Lodge night, held at the house of Mr. James Tew, Wednesday
    evening, the 7th February, 1781. 5781.

    "A motion being made that as our worthy brother, his Excellency
    General Washington, was daily expected amongst us, a committee
    should be appointed to prepare an address in behalf of the Lodge, to
    present him. Voted, That the Right Worshipful Master (Moses Michael
    Hays) together with brothers Seixas, Peleg Clark, John Handy, and
    Robert Elliot, be a committee for that purpose, and that they
    present the same to this Lodge at their next meeting for their
    approbation."

    "At a Lodge held by request of the Right Worshipful Master, Feb.
    14th, 1781. 5781,

    "The committee appointed to draught an address to our worthy
    brother, His Excellency General Washington, report, that on inquiry
    they find General Washington not to be a Grand Master of North
    America; as was supposed, nor even Master of any particular Lodge.
    They are, therefore, of opinion that this Lodge would not choose to
    address him as a private brother at the same time, think it would
    not be agreeable to our worthy brother to be addressed as such.

    "Voted, That the report of the committee be received, and that the
    address be entirely laid aside for the present."[11]


Now as to the cause for this uncertainty how to address Brother
WASHINGTON, it will be recalled that just at that time, the proposition
sent out by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania nominating General
WASHINGTON as Grand Master of all the Colonies, was then before the
various grand bodies, but did not find favor in New England, in fact the
Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was the chief objector, and finally
defeated the scheme to elect WASHINGTON the Grand Master General.[12]

The means of intercourse between the different Masonic Bodies at that
early day were so limited and uncertain that it offers a clear
explanation for the uncertainty under which the brethren of King David's
Lodge, No. 1, at Newport labored at that time.

During the Anti-Masonic craze in the last century, the above minute was
extensively used by the political leaders of the Anti-Masonic party to
strengthen their claim that WASHINGTON had never presided over any
Masonic Lodge.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH WATSON & CASSOUL, NANTES, FRANCE, AUGUST, 1782.


The earliest letter of General GEORGE WASHINGTON of Masonic Import known
is the one written while in camp at Newburgh in New York, dated State of
New York, August 10, 1782, to the firm of Watson and Cassoul in Nantes,
France, in which his friend, Brother Elkanah Watson was the chief
partner, thanking the firm for the Masonic Apron and ornaments sent him
from Nantes, France.

This apron is now in the possession of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge,
No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.

Elkanah Watson in his Memoirs states:[13]

     "Wishing to pay some mark of respect to our beloved Washington, I
     employed, in conjunction with my friend M. Cossoul, nuns in one of
     the convents at Nantes to prepare some elegant Masonic ornaments,
     and gave them a plan for combining the American and French Flags on
     the apron designed for this use. They were executed in a superior
     and expensive style. We transmitted them to America, accompanied by
     an appropriate address."


By the above extract is shown beyond all doubt the error in the
statement so repeatedly made, that the apron at Alexandria is the one
made by the Marquise de Lafayette, and presented to WASHINGTON by
General Lafayette, during his visit to Mount Vernon in 1784, and the one
in the Museum of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, that of Watson and
Cassoul.[14]

Following letter was sent to WASHINGTON, together with the Masonic Apron
and "Ornaments," by Messrs. Watson and Cassoul, from France under date
"east of Nantes," 23d 1st Month, 5782.[15]

     "TO HIS EXCELLENCY, GENERAL WASHINGTON, AMERICA.

     "_Most Illustrious and Respected Brother:_

     "In the moment when all Europe admire and feel the effects of your
     glorious efforts in support of American liberty, we hasten to offer
     for your acceptance a small pledge of our homage. Zealous lovers of
     liberty and its institutions, we have experienced the most refined
     joy in seeing our chief and brother stand forth in its defence, and
     in defence of a newborn nation of Republicans.

     "Your glorious career will not be confined to the protection of
     American liberty, but its ultimate effect will extend to the whole
     human family, since Providence has evidently selected you as an
     instrument in his hands, to fulfill his eternal decrees.

     "It is to you, therefore, the glorious orb of America, we presume
     to offer Masonic ornaments, as an emblem of your virtues. May the
     Grand Architect of the Universe be the Guardian of your precious
     days, for the glory of the Western Hemisphere and the entire
     universe. Such are the vows of those who have the favor to be by
     all the known numbers."

        "Your affectionate brothers,
          "WATSON & CASSOUL."

     "East of Nantes, 23d 1st Month, 5782."


=WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS

NEWBURGH-ON-THE-HUDSON WHERE THE WATSON AND CASSOUL LETTER WAS WRITTEN,
AUGUST, 1782.=


Owing to the uncertain intercourse between the two countries, it was
almost seven months before Brother WASHINGTON received the Masonic
apron, ornaments and letter from France. He at that time was in camp
with the army at Newburg on the Hudson.[16]

In reply WASHINGTON sent the following autograph letter to the donors in
Nantes, viz.:

     "STATE OF NEW YORK
     "Augt 10th 1782.

     "Gentn.

         "East of Nantes"


This autograph letter from WASHINGTON to Messrs. Watson and Cassoul is
now in the possession of the Grand Lodge of New York, who purchased it
from a member of the Watson family in the year 1866 or 1867 at a cost of
approximately $1,000, and is now framed and secured between two sheets
of glass in the collection of the Committee of Antiquities of the Grand
Lodge F. & A. M. of New York.[18]

It is written upon two pages of an ordinary letter sheet, and was a copy
of one written by WASHINGTON, with which he was not entirely satisfied,
as shown by the changes made in the text before it was sent to France.
The first copy WASHINGTON retained, and is now in the Library of
Congress, and is here given for comparison, viz:

A photographic fac-simile of the letter now in New York, and a photostat
of the original copy retained by WASHINGTON are in the collection of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.

The firm of Watson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, acted as confidential
agents of the American Government during the Revolutionary period, as is
shown by their correspondence with Benjamin Franklin in the Franklin
Mss. collection of the American Philosophical Society.[19] Elkanah
Watson was also a bearer of despatches to Dr. Franklin.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALEXANDRIA LODGE, NO. 39, VIRGINIA, DECEMBER, 1783.


The next Masonic Letter of Brother WASHINGTON of which we have any
knowledge is the one written in answer to a letter sent him, upon his
return to civil life by the Brethren of Lodge No. 39, on the register of
the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which met at Alexandria, Virginia.

December 23, 1783, General WASHINGTON presented himself to "The United
States in Congress Assembled," at Annapolis, Maryland, and resigned his
Commission that he had received on June 17, 1775, as Commander-in-Chief
of the Armies of the United States.

Upon Christmas Eve he returned to Mount Vernon, whereupon the Brethren
at Alexandria, who, it must be remembered, were working under a
Pennsylvania Warrant, at once sent the following Address signed by the
Officers of Lodge No. 39, to Brother WASHINGTON at Mount Vernon,[20]
viz.:

     "_Sir_: Whilst all denominations of people bless the happy occasion
     of your excellency's return to enjoy private and domestic felicity,
     permit us, sir, the members of Lodge No. 39, lately established in
     Alexandria, to assure your excellency, that we, as a mystical body,
     rejoice in having a brother so near us, whose preeminent
     benevolence has secured the happiness of millions; and that we
     shall esteem ourselves highly honored at all times your excellency
     shall be pleased to join us in the needful business."

     "We have the honor to be, in the name and behalf of No. 39, your
     excellency's

     "Devoted friends and brothers,
        "ROBERT ADAM, M.
        "E. C. DICK, S. W.
        "J. ALLISON, J. W.
        "WM. RAMSAY, _Treas._"

     "His Excellency General Washington."


Two days later Brother WASHINGTON sent following reply,[21] viz.:

     "MOUNT VERNON 28th Decr. 1783.

     "_Gentlemen_:

     "With pleasing sensibility
     "I received your favor of the 26th, and
     "beg leave to offer you my sincere thanks
     "for the favorable sentiments with
     "which it abounds.--

     "I shall always feel pleasure
     "when it may be in my power to ren-
     "der service to Lodge Nº 39, and in
     "every act of brotherly kindness to the
     "Members of it; being with great truth.

        "Your affecte Brother
        "and Obedt Servant
          "Go. Washington"

     "Robt Adam Esqr Master,
       "& the Wardens & Treasr
         "of Lodge Nº 39."


No copy of either address nor reply of this correspondence has thus far
been found among the Washington papers in the Library of Congress, by
the present writer.

Brother Robert Adam, the Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, was a Son
of the Rev. John Adam, D.D., and Janet Campbell, of Kelbride, Scotland,
was born May 4, 1731; he emigrated to America in 1753, and, after a
short residence at Annapolis, Md., established himself at a pleasant
country residence in Fairfax County, Virginia, about four miles from
Alexandria. He was a gentleman of refined taste, cultivation and wealth,
and interested himself in everything that could promote the prosperity
of his adopted home.


=WASHINGTON'S REPLY TO ALEXANDRIA LODGE, NO. 39. ORIGINAL IN
ALEXANDRIA-WASHINGTON LODGE, NO. 22, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA.=


It appears that during his residence at Annapolis, he was made a Mason
in a clandestine or irregular Lodge, and in the year 1783 applied for a
dispensation from the Grand Master of Pennsylvania, to apply to Lodge
No. 2, for initiation and membership.

Brother Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, Senior Warden of Lodge No. 39, was a
native of Pennsylvania, born near Marcus Hook, in Delaware County, about
1753, and died at Alexandria, Va., September 22, 1825. He was a son of
Archibald Dick, a member of Lodge No. 2 at Philadelphia, and joined the
same Lodge, September 15, 1779.[22] Brother Elisha C. Dick was a
graduate of the old Pequea Academy, and of the College of Pennsylvania.
He began the study of medicine under Drs. William Shippen and Benjamin
Rush. After graduating he settled in Alexandria, Va., and at once became
active in Masonic circles in that city, and was instrumental in having
the petition presented to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for a warrant,
which was granted under the name and number "Alexandria Lodge No. 39."

Upon the records of the Lodge, Brother Dick appears as both predecessor
and successor of Brother WASHINGTON as Master. Brother Dick was the
first consulting physician in WASHINGTON's last illness, and also
conducted the Masonic services at WASHINGTON's funeral on December 18,
1799. A biography of Dr. Dick is in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.

Brother John Allison, the Junior Warden of Lodge No. 39, had served as
Major in the 1st Virginia State Regiment, and later as Lieutenant
Colonel.

Brother William Ramsay, Treasurer of Lodge No. 39, was an old personal
friend of WASHINGTON.

For a history of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, warranted by the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania, February 3, 1783, which was constituted on the second
floor of a large three-story frame building, known as the "Lamb Tavern,"
on the twenty-fifth of February, 1783, the Masonic student is referred
to "Old Masonic Lodges of Pennsylvania," Philadelphia, 1913, Chapter
XLVI, pp. 153-168.

This tavern was situated on the west side of Union Street, between
Prince and Duke Streets, Alexandria, the site of which is now known as
No. 55 South Union Street.[23]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALEXANDRIA LODGE, NO. 39, VIRGINIA, JUNE, 1784.


The next Washington letter of Masonic import in chronological order is
his reply to an invitation to join the brethren of Alexandria Lodge, No.
39, in the celebration of St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24, 1784, to
which WASHINGTON sent the following reply, accepting the fraternal
invitation.

     "MOUNT VERNON, June 19, 1784.[24]

     "_Dear Sir_: With pleasure, I received the invita- tion of the
     master and members of Lodge No. 39, to dine with them on the
     approaching anniversary of St. John the Baptist. If nothing
     unforeseen at present interferes, I will have the honor of doing it.
     For the polite and flattering terms in which you have expressed
     their wishes, you will please accept my thanks."

        "With esteem and respect,
          "I am, dear sir,
            "Your most Ob't serv't
              "Go. Washington"

     "Wm. Herbert, Esquire."


=PLACE OF MEETING OF ALEXANDRIA LODGE, No. 39, ON PENNSYLVANIA REGISTER,
ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA, WHERE GENERAL WASHINGTON ACCEPTED HONORARY MEMBERSHIP,
JUNE 24, 1784.=


No copy of this invitation nor acceptance, has thus far been found among
the Washington papers.

The original of this letter is also said to be among the relics of
Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22. As no fac-simile copy was
obtainable, an engrossed copy for same was substituted in the collection
of Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.

This banquet was held at Wise's tavern[25] and was participated in by
WASHINGTON, who upon this festive occasion was elected an honorary
Member of Lodge No. 39, upon the Pennsylvania register, and thus became
a Pennsylvania Freemason, and his name is duly recorded as such upon the
minutes of Lodge No. 39.

This fact further contradicts the Anti-Masonic arguments based upon the
Snyder letter so extensively used during the years 1826-1833, that
WASHINGTON never belonged to any Masonic Lodge, after his initiation in
the Fredericksburg Lodge in 1752.

The above note as recorded upon the Minutes of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39,
shows that WASHINGTON was in complete harmony with the Masonic
Fraternity; further, that by his acceptance of membership, WASHINGTON
became a Pennsylvania Mason.

Among the cherished relics in the Alexandria Lodge, there is none more
valuable than the Masonic portrait of Brother WASHINGTON, which forms
the frontispiece of this volume. This was painted from life in pastel,
by William Williams, at Philadelphia in 1794.

In the year 1910 a fac-simile of this portrait was made in oil by Miss
Fanny M. Burke, an artist of repute, and a great-granddaughter of Thomas
Jefferson. This replica made for the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania is the
only one ever made of this portrait and shows Brother WASHINGTON as a
man and Mason, neither heroized nor idealized.[26]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH KING DAVID'S LODGE, NO. 1, RHODE ISLAND, AUGUST,
1790.


The next correspondence in chronological order is the letter, sent in
reply to the Address delivered by the Brethren of King David's Lodge,
No. 1, at Newport, Rhode Island, to President WASHINGTON, August 17,
1790, during his visit to New England.

By referring to the Minutes of this old Lodge following entry is found:

     "At a Lodge, called by request of several Breth-
     "ren on Tuesday evening, August 17, 5790, an
     "Entered Apprentice Lodge being opened in due
     "form proceeded to business, when it was proposed
     "to address the President of the United States.
     "The R. W. Master (Moses Seixas) Henry Sher-
     "burne, and the Secretary, [William Littlefield]
     "were appointed a committee for that purpose,
     "after which the Lodge closed."[27]


Following address was prepared and according to local tradition was
publicly presented, by the Committee to President WASHINGTON, in the
Venerable Sanctuary of the Jewish Congregation at Newport; the Brethren
of King David's Lodge being present:

     "TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, _President of the United
                                 States of America._

     "We the Master, Wardens, and Brethren of
     "King David's Lodge in New Port Rhode Island
     "with joyful hearts embrace this opportunity to
     "greet you as a Brother, and to hail you welcome

Brother Moses Seixas was born in New York, March 28, 1744; died in New
York City, November 29, 1809. He was a merchant in Newport, Rhode
Island, and one of the founders of the Newport Bank of Rhode Island, of
which he was cashier until his death. He succeeded Brother Moses M. Hays
as Worshipful Master of King David's Lodge at Newport. He was also the
first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island. It was Moses
Seixas who addressed a letter of welcome in the name of the Jewish
congregation to GEORGE WASHINGTON when the latter visited Newport, and
it was to him that WASHINGTON's answer was addressed.

The Town Hall at Newport being out of repair at that time the ancient
Jewish Synagogue on the main street was used, upon that and several
other public occasions. It is an interesting fact that this sacred
edifice is still preserved in the same condition as it was during the
Colonial period.

So far as known this address was the first of Masonic import made to
WASHINGTON as President. Unfortunately, the exact date of presentation
and receipt of his answer is not known to a certainty, as there does not
appear to be any date upon either the original documents or the copies
in WASHINGTON's letter book.

The original address and WASHINGTON's reply to the Master, Wardens and
Brethren of King David's Lodge in Newport, the latter signed in
autograph by WASHINGTON, are in the Athenæum collection at Boston,
Massachusetts.[29]

Following copy of the President's answer is taken from his letter
book.[30] Both address and answer in the letter book are in the
handwriting of Major William Jackson, secretary to the President.

A photostat of the original entry is in the Archives of the Grand
Lodge of Pennsylvania. It will be noted that there is neither place nor
date given.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH ST. JOHN'S LODGE, NO. 2 AT NEWBERN, N. C., APRIL,
1791.


The next Masonic letter of President WASHINGTON was written, in answer
to an address by the brethren of St. John's Lodge, No. 2, at Newbern,
North Carolina, during his southern tour in 1791.

April 7, 1791, WASHINGTON started on a tour through the Southern States,
by way of Fredericksburg, Richmond, and Petersburg, Virginia; Halifax,
Tarborough, Newbern, and Wilmington, North Carolina; Georgetown, and
Charleston, South Carolina; and Savannah, Georgia.

When advice of this proposed presidential visit reached Newbern, the
brethren of St. John's Lodge, No. 2,[34] at the stated meeting held on
April 1, 1791, passed the following resolution. "_Resolved_, that an
address shall be presented to Brother GEORGE WASHINGTON, in behalf of
this Lodge, on his arriving in this town."[35]

Upon his arrival at Newbern, N. C., April 20, following address was
presented to the President,[36] which, together with the reply, has thus
far never been in print or noted:

     "TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
         AMERICA.

     "The Address of St Johns Lodge No. 2 of

     "energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms
     "glow toward you.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH PRINCE GEORGE'S LODGE, NO. 16, GEORGETOWN, S. C.,
APRIL, 1791.


WASHINGTON left Newbern, North Carolina, under an escort of horse, April
22, 1791, and arrived at Georgetown, South Carolina, by way of
Wilmington, N. C., Saturday, April 30, where he was received with a
salute of cannon, and by a company of infantry, and during the afternoon
was presented with the following address, by a Committee of Prince
George's Lodge, No. 16 (Moderns), of Georgetown, South Carolina.

This Lodge was one of the original six Lodges, which had been warranted
prior to 1756 in South Carolina, under the Jurisdiction of the
Provincial Grand Lodge, and through it, the Grand Lodge of England. It
is the only instance where a Lodge of the "Moderns" addressed Brother
WASHINGTON:

     "TO OUR ILLUSTRIOUS BROTHER GEORGE WASHINGTON.

     "_President of the United States._

     "you to express the lively sensations you inspire as

     "behold in you the liberator of our country. the
     "distributor of its equal laws, and a Brother of our
     "most ancient and most honorable Order.

     "At the same time indulge us in congratulating

VII

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, MAY, 1791.


President WASHINGTON left Georgetown at six o'clock in the evening, May
1, 1791, reaching Charleston, South Carolina, Monday, May 2, in a
twelve-oared barge rowed by twelve American captains of ships
accompanied by a great number of boats with gentlemen and ladies in
them, and two boats with music.[40] Brother WASHINGTON remained in
Charleston until May 9.

Wednesday, May 4, 1791, General Mordecai Gist, an old companion in arms
of WASHINGTON, and formerly Master of the Military Lodge in the Maryland
line (No. 27 upon the register of Pennsylvania),[41] but now Grand
Master of the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons of South Carolina,
attended by the other present and past grand officers,[42] waited on
their beloved brother, the president of the United States, and presented
the following address:[43]

     "_Sir_--Induced by a respect for your public and private character,
     as well as the relation in which you stand with the brethren of
     this society, we the Grand Lodge of the State of South Carolina,
     Ancient York Masons, beg leave to offer our sincere congratulations
     on your arrival in this state.

     "We felicitate you on the establishment and exercise of a permanent
     government, whose foundation was laid under your auspices by
     military achievements, upon which have been progressively reared
     the pillars of the free republic over which you preside, supported
     by wisdom, strength, and beauty unrivalled among the nations of the
     world.

     "The fabric thus raised and committed to your superintendence, we
     earnestly wish may continue to produce order and harmony to
     succeeding ages, and be the asylum of virtue to the oppressed of
     all parts of the universe.

     "When we contemplate the distresses of war, the instances of
     humanity displayed by the Craft afford some relief to the feeling
     mind; and it gives us the most pleasing sensation to recollect,
     that amidst the difficulties attendant on your late military
     stations, you still associated with, and patronized the Ancient
     Fraternity.

     "Distinguished always by your virtues, more than the exalted
     stations in which you have moved, we exult in the opportunity you
     now give us of hailing you brother of our Order, and trust from
     your knowledge of our institution, to merit your countenance and
     support.

     "With fervent zeal for your happiness, we pray that a life so dear
     to the bosom of this society, and to society in general, may be
     long, very long preserved; and when you leave the temporal symbolic
     lodges of this world, may you be received into the celestial lodge
     of light and perfection, where the Grand Master Architect of the
     Universe presides.

     "Done in behalf of the Grand Lodge.

        "M. GIST, G. M."[44]

     "Charleston, 2d May, 1791."


To this address WASHINGTON returned the following reply.[45]

     "_Gentlemen_:--I am much obliged by the respect which you are so
     good as to declare for my public and private character. I recognize
     with pleasure my relation to the brethren of your Society, and I
     accept with gratitude your congratulations on my arrival in South
     Carolina.

     "Your sentiments, on the establishment and exercise of our equal
     government, are worthy of an association, whose principles lead to
     purity of morals, and are beneficial of action.

     "The fabric of our freedom is placed on the enduring basis of
     public virtue, and will, I fondly hope, long continue to protect
     the prosperity of the architects who raised it. I shall be happy,
     on every occasion, to evince my regard for the Fraternity. For your
     prosperity individually, I offer my best wishes."

        "Go. Washington"


This letter was probably destroyed with other Grand Lodge property when
Columbia, South Carolina, was burned by Sherman's Army during the war
between the States.[46]

Fortunately, the original draft of WASHINGTON's reply, was found among
the Washington papers now in the Library of Congress. This is written
upon two pages of a letter sheet: the first page shows a paragraph which
was suppressed and did not appear upon the clear copy sent to the Grand
Lodge of Ancient York Masons of South Carolina.

A photostat of this draft is in the collection of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, viz.:

HANDWRITING OF MAYOR WILLIAM JACKSON.=


Upon the first page the four lines commencing with "Your felicitations"
and ending with "federal government" were crossed out, and as above
stated, were not in the reply sent to R. W. Grand Master Gist and his
officers.

In the third line from the bottom the word "regard" is substituted for
"respect."

Brother Gist was the original Warrant Master of the Regimental Lodge in
the Maryland line, No. 27, on the Roster of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania. After the war, Brother Gist settled in Charleston, South
Carolina, retaining his old Military Warrant, and, in 1786, applied to
the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, to renew this warrant, for a Lodge to
be located at Charleston under the same number. This request was
granted, and Brother Gist was again named as Warrant Master.

At the formation of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina Ancient York
Masons in 1787, Brother Gist was elected Deputy Grand Master and served
as such during the years 1787-88-89, and as Grand Master, 1790-1791.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF GEORGIA, MAY, 1791.


On the way from Charleston, South Carolina, to Savannah, Georgia,
WASHINGTON called on Mrs. Greene, the widow of late Brother General
Nathaniel Greene, at her plantation called Mulberry Grove, reaching
Savannah, Georgia, on the evening of Thursday, May 12, 1791.

Saturday, May 14, WASHINGTON was waited on by Brethren of the Grand
Lodge of Georgia and presented with the following address:[47]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF PENNSYLVANIA, JANUARY 3, 1792.


During the Presidential term of Brother WASHINGTON, the President, when
in Philadelphia, lived in a large double three-story brick mansion, on
the south side of Market Street, sixty feet east of Sixth Street, the
site of which is now occupied by three stores, viz.: Nos. 526, 528, 530.

The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania then held its meetings in the upper
floor of the Meeting house of the Free Quakers, still standing, at the
southwest corner of Arch and Fifth Streets; this was but a short
distance from the presidential mansion. Brother WASHINGTON was
undoubtedly personally acquainted with many of its members, especially
such as had been officers during the Revolution, and were fellow members
of the Cincinnati.

On St. John's Day, December 27, 1791, a Grand Lodge was opened in ample
form,[49] and the Minutes of the last Grand Communication were read, as
far as concerns the election of Grand Officers.

The Grand Officers upon this occasion were:

Brother Jonathan Bayard Smith, _R. W. Grand Master_.

Brother Joseph Few, _Deputy Grand Master_.

Brother Thomas Procter, _Senior Grand Warden_.

Brother Gavin Hamilton, _Junior Grand Warden_.

Brother Peter Le Barbier Duplessis, _Grand Secretary_.

Brother Benjamin Mason, _Grand Treasurer_.

The Rev. Brother Dr. William Smith then addressed the Brethren in an
oration suitable to the Grand Day, and the thanks of the Lodge were
given to said Brother William Smith for the same.

After which, on motion and seconded, the Rev. Brother Dr. Smith and the
Right Worshipful Grand Officers were appointed a Committee to prepare an
address to our Illustrious Brother GEORGE WASHINGTON, President of the
United States; and this Lodge was adjourned to the second day of January
next to receive the report of said Committee.

     "PHILADELPHIA, January 2d, 1792.

     "_Grand Lodge, By Adjournment_,[50]

     "A Grand Lodge was opened in ample form, and the Minutes of St.
     John's Day being read as far as relates to the appointment of a
     Committee to prepare an Address to our illustrious Brother George
     Washington, The Revd. Bro. Dr. Wm. Smith, one of the said
     Committee, presented the Draft of one which was read, Whereupon, on
     Motion and Seconded, the same was unanimously approved of, and
     Resolved, That the Rt. Wt. Grand Master, Depy. G. Master, and
     Grand Officers, with the Revd Bro. Smith, be a Committee to
     present the said Address in behalf of this Rt. Wt. Grand Lodge,

     the Grand Secretary.

Following is the address presented to Brother WASHINGTON. Both the
original draft in the handwriting of Brother William Smith, showing
minor alterations, as well as a fair copy, are in the archives of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.[51]

A.--FOLIO.--21.=


On January 3, 1792, Jonathan Bayard Smith, the Right Worshipful Grand
Master, together with the Grand Officers and Rev. Brother William Smith
called on the President and delivered the above address.

The deputation was received in the dining room of the presidential
mansion. This was a room about thirty feet long, and where WASHINGTON
was accustomed to receive delegations.

At the Quarterly Communication held March 5, 1792, the Right Worshipful
Grand Master Jonathan B. Smith informed the Brethren that, in conformity
to the resolve of this Grand Lodge, he had, in company with the Grand
Officers and the Rev. Brother Dr. Smith, presented the address to our
illustrious Brother GEORGE WASHINGTON and had received an answer, which
was read.

     "TO THE ANCIENT YORK MASONS OF THE
       "JURISDICTION OF PENNSYLVANIA.

     "_Gentlemen and Brothers_,

     "I receive your kind Congratulations

ORIGINAL APRON IN MUSEUM OF THE GRAND LODGE.=


Whereupon, on motion and seconded, Resolved, unanimously, that the said
address and the answer thereto, shall be entered on the minutes.

This answer, in possession of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, is in the
handwriting of Tobias Lear, who was the private secretary of the
President, and for years attended to the details of WASHINGTON's
domestic affairs, and was liberally remembered by him in his will.

The letter was signed by WASHINGTON, who had both the address and answer
copied verbatim in one of his letter books[52] by Bartholomew Dandridge,
secretary to the President. A photostat copy of above, together with the
original answer by WASHINGTON is in the Archives of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.

This address was read by Rev. Brother William Smith, one of the most
noted Episcopal preachers in Philadelphia, and the first Provost of the
College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania. Brother
William Smith, D.D., had been an active member of the Masonic
Fraternity in Pennsylvania for forty years; he was the Chaplain of the
Grand Lodge of Moderns for almost a quarter of a century. In winter of
1778 he joined the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons, and for some time
served as Grand Secretary.[53]

Jonathan Bayard Smith, the Grand Master of Pennsylvania, was one of
Philadelphia's prominent citizens. During the Revolutionary period he
was an ardent patriot; he was among the earliest of those who espoused
the cause of independence. In 1775 he was chosen secretary of the
Committee of Safety, and in February, 1777, he was elected by the
assembly a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was a second time
chosen to this post, serving in the congresses of 1777-8. From April 4,
1777, till Nov. 13, 1778, he was prothonotary of the court of Common
Pleas.

On December 1, 1777, he presided at the public meeting, in Philadelphia,
of "Real Whigs," by whom it was resolved "That it be recommended to the
council of safety that in this great emergency ... every person between
the age of sixteen and fifty years be ordered out under arms." During
this year he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of a battalion of
"Associators."


=J B SMITH

B. FEB. 21, 1742; D. JUNE 16, 1812.

GRAND MASTER OF MASONS IN PENNSYLVANIA, 1789-1794.=


In 1778 he was appointed a justice of the court of Common Pleas, Quarter
Sessions, and Orphans' Court, which post he held for many years. He
was appointed in 1781, one of the auditors of the accounts of
Pennsylvania troops in the service of the United States. In 1792, and
subsequently, he was chosen an alderman of the city, which was an office
of great dignity in his day, and in 1794 he was elected auditor-general
of Pennsylvania.

Brother Jonathan B. Smith was an active member of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania. He was the Senior Grand Warden in 1786, at the time when
the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania: "_Resolved_, that the Grand
Lodge is, and ought to be perfectly independent and free of any such
foreign jurisdiction."[54]

In the two following years he was appointed Deputy Grand Master by Right
Worshipful Grand Master William Adcock; he was elected Right Worshipful
Grand Master in 1789 and served in that capacity for six years
(1789-1794). In the year 1798 he was again elected to that honorable
office, serving five more consecutive years (1798 to 1802), when he
declined reëlection. The following action was taken by the Grand
Lodge:[55]

     "On Motion made and Seconded the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania
     impressed with a grateful sense of the long assiduous and highly
     useful labours of their late R. W. Grand Master, Bror Jonathan
     Bayard Smith, Esqr, previous to and during his service in the
     high Station which he has left, Resolved Unanimously, That the most
     respectful Thanks of the said G. Lodge be presented to their said
     Brother Jonathan Bayard Smith for the eminent services he has
     rendered to the Craft generally and more especially for the able,
     diligent and impartial manner in which he has discharged the Duties
     of the Chair and while they deplore the necessity of his now
     retiring from the Official Station amongst them which he has so
     Honourably filled, they hope for a continuance of his Brotherly
     Love, Aid and information and finally that he be requested to
     receive the best wishes of the Grand Lodge for a prolongation of
     his useful life, a commensurate enjoyment of his Health and his
     final Happiness in the Mansion of Everlasting Rest."


Brother Joseph Few, Deputy Grand Master, was also a Revolutionary
Soldier, having served as Regimental Quarter Master with the 4th
Continental Artillery.

Brother Thomas Procter, Senior Grand Warden, formerly Colonel of the
Pennsylvania Artillery, and Warrant Master of the Military Lodge, No.
19, upon the Roster of Pennsylvania was prominent in both civil and
political affairs during WASHINGTON's administration. A full account of
Brother Thomas Procter and this Military Lodge will be found in the
History of the Old Masonic Lodges of Pennsylvania, published by the
Grand Lodge in 1913.[56]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS, DECEMBER, 1792.


     "At Grand Lodge held at Concert Hall, Boston, 10th of December, 5792,
     being a Quarterly Communication it was

     "_Resolved_, That the Grand Master, with the Grand Wardens, present

                         GEORGE WASHINGTON,

At the next Quarterly Communication we find that,

     "Agreeably to a resolve at the last Quarterly Communication, the
     Grand Master, with his Wardens, reported:

     "That they had written to our beloved President and Brother, George
     Washington, and presented him with a Book of Constitutions, to
     which letter he had been pleased to make answer. The letter and
     answer were read, and Voted to be inserted in the records of the
     Grand Lodge."


This address was evidently sent to President WASHINGTON at Philadelphia,
and was answered from the presidential office in that city. No date nor
place appears upon either the original so far as known, nor the copy in
the letter book, both address and reply therein being in the handwriting
of Bartholomew Dandridge, Secretary to the President.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DECEMBER, 1796.


September 18, 1796, President WASHINGTON issued his farewell address.
His second term was drawing to a close; the term had been a more or less
exciting one: The passing of the Neutrality Act; Genet's appeal from the
executive to the people; the Fugitive Slave Act; the whiskey
insurrection in western Pennsylvania; the adoption of the Eleventh
amendment; the purchase of peace from Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis; the
troubles with Great Britain about the non-delivery of the military posts
and later the Jay Treaty, all came within President WASHINGTON's second
and last term.[58]

During these troublous times WASHINGTON had no stauncher supporters than
his Masonic Brethren of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Further, that
WASHINGTON kept more or less in touch with his Masonic Brethren of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania is shown by the fact that he attended the
services at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, on Third Street below Walnut,
on St. John's Day, December 27, 1793, where a charity sermon was
preached by Rev. Brother Samuel Magaw, D.D., Vice-Provost of the
University of Pennsylvania, before the Grand and Subordinate Lodges for
the purpose of increasing the relief fund, for the widows and orphans of
the yellow fever epidemic which ravaged the capital city during the past
summer.[59]

When the Brethren found that WASHINGTON positively declined reëlection
in 1796, and that John Adams was elected to succeed him on the fourth of
March following, the Brethren of the Grand Lodge at their Quarterly
Communication, December 5, 1796, determined that it would be right and
proper to present him with an address before his retirement from office,
whereupon, it was resolved: "On Motion and seconded, that a Committee be
appointed to frame an Address to be presented on the ensuing Feast of
St John, Decemr 27th, to the Great Master Workman, our Illustrious Br.
Washington, on the occasion of his intended retirement from Public
Labor, to be also laid before the said Grand Lodge on St John's Day, and
the Rt W. Grand Master, Deputy G. M. Brs Sadler, Milnor and Williams,
were accordingly appointed."

At a Grand Lodge held on St. John's Day, Philadelphia, December 27,
5796, "The Committee appointed to prepare an Address to our Brother
George Washington, President of the United States, presented an Address
by them drawn up, which was ordered to be read, and was in the words
following, to wit:

     "To GEORGE WASHINGTON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

     "The Address of the Grand Lodge of Pennsyl-
     "vania.

     "_Most Respected Sir and Brother_,

     "Having announced your intention to retire from
     "_Public Labour_ to that _Refreshment_ to which your
     "preëminent Services for near Half a Century have
     "so justly entitled you. Permit the Grand Lodge
     "of Pennsylvania at this last Feast of our Evangelic
     "Master St. John, on which we can hope for an im-
     "mediate Communication with you to join the grate-
     "ful Voice of our Country in Acknowledging that
     "you have carried forth the Principles of the Lodge
     "into every Walk of your Life, by your constant
     "Labours for the Prosperity of that Country, by
     "your unremitting Endeavours to promote Order,
     "Union and Brotherly Affection amongst us, and
     "lastly by the Vows of your Farewell Address to
     "your Brethren and Fellow Citizens. An Address
     "which we trust Our Children and Our Childrens
     "Children will ever look upon as a most invaluable
     "Legacy from a _Friend_ a _Benefactor_ and a _Father_.

     "To these our grateful Acknowledgments (leav-
     "ing to the impartial Pen of History to record the
     "important Events in which you have borne so illus-

It was then moved and seconded that the same be adopted. Upon the
question being taken it appeared that it was approved of. On motion and
seconded, it was agreed that a committee be appointed to wait on Brother
WASHINGTON to acquaint him that it is the intention of this Grand Lodge
to present an address to him, and to know what time he shall be pleased
to appoint to receive it. The committee appointed to perform this duty
were Brothers William Smith, Peter Le Barbier Duplessis and Thomas
Procter, who, after having waited on him, reported that he had appointed
to-morrow, December 28, 1796, at twelve o'clock to receive it. Said
committee, to wit, Brothers W. Smith, Duplessis and Procter, together
with Right Worshipful Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, and Junior
Wardens, Grand Secretary and the Masters of the different Lodges in the
City, were then appointed a Deputation to present the said Address.

This deputation consisted of Right Worshipful Grand Master William Moore
Smith, Gavin Hamilton, Deputy Grand Master, Thomas Town, Senior Grand
Warden, Thomas Armstrong, Esqr., Junior Grand Warden, George A.
Baker, Grand Secretary, John McElwee, Grand Treasurer, and the following
Masters of the Philadelphia Lodges, viz.: David Irwin, No. 2, Israel
Israel, No. 3, Andrew Nilson No. 9, Eleaser Oswald, No. 19, Cadawalder
Griffith, No. 52, Richard E. Cusack, No. 59, Thomas Bradley, No. 67,
William Nelson, No. 71; together with the appointed Committee, Brothers
William Smith D.D., Le Barbier Duplessis and Thomas Procter.

President WASHINGTON received the august deputation of the Brethren at
the appointed time; the address was read before him by the Rev. Brother
William Smith, D.D., whereupon he returned them a reply. This
document, still in the Library of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, is
entirely in the handwriting of WASHINGTON and signed by him, viz.:

     "FELLOW-CITIZENS AND BROTHERS,
       "OF THE GRAND LODGE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

     "I have received your address
     "with all the feelings of brotherly affection,

     "instrument in the hands of Providence,
     "to promote order and union, and erect upon
     "a solid foundation the true principles of

=FAC-SIMILE OF WASHINGTON'S REPLY TO GRAND LODGE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DECEMBER,
1796. ORIGINAL IN ARCHIVES OF THE GRAND LODGE OF PENNSYLVANIA.=


Brother William Moore Smith, Right Worshipful Grand Master of
Pennsylvania, whose first official act as Grand Master was to head the
committee to call on the President, was a son of the Rev. William Smith,
D.D., born in Philadelphia, June 1, 1759. He was a lawyer by profession
and served as Deputy Grand Master for the year 1795 under the Venerable
William Ball, and as Right Worshipful Grand Master for the years
1796-1797. He was appointed by the President as agent for the settlement
of claims that were provided for in the Sixth Article of John Jay's
Treaty, and visited England in 1803 to close the commission. He died at
the Smith Homestead at Falls of Schuylkill, March 12, 1821.

Both the address and reply were copied in WASHINGTON's Letter Book III,
pp. 244-245, in the handwriting of one of his secretaries, G. W. Craik,
a son of Dr. James Craik, WASHINGTON's "compatriot in arms, and old and
intimate friend," who attended him during his last illness.

Photostat copies of above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, also the original draft of the address, presented to the
President (Mss. Volume A, folio 23).

This autograph Masonic letter from WASHINGTON to the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania has been reproduced in fac-simile, published and circulated
(in most cases without the knowledge or consent of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania) more widely than any other known letter of WASHINGTON.
Some of these copies are treasured by their owners under the impression
that they have the original letter. Several cases of this kind have of
late come under the notice of the writer. In one case where one of these
reproductions was offered for sale, hundreds of dollars were asked for
the reproduction, and it was with great difficulty that the owner could
be convinced of its character.

Another use made of this letter by unprincipled persons was to make a
photo-lithographic copy of the letter, and substitute the name of
another state for that of Pennsylvania, and then palm it off upon the
authorities of that state as an original letter to their Grand Lodge.
The latest case of this kind known to the writer is that of the Grand
Lodge of Georgia, who were thus imposed upon.

Then again the letter has been extensively used for advertising purposes
by publishing houses of Masonic literature.

The letter has also been printed in most all books bearing upon Masonic
history during the revolutionary period.

It was also frequently quoted and criticised during the Anti-Masonic
craze which swept over the country some eighty-odd years ago, it being
the chief Masonic letter of the five known to the leaders of those
misguided persons. The main point of their argument was that it bore no
date and therefore was not authentic.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALEXANDRIA LODGE, NO. 22, VIRGINIA.


Upon pages 244 and 245 of WASHINGTON's folio Letter Book No. III in the
Library of Congress are recorded a letter and address to WASHINGTON from
the Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 22, of Virginia, together with
WASHINGTON's reply.

WASHINGTON and his family had left Philadelphia, Thursday, March 9,
1797, for Mount Vernon, and arrived at Baltimore, Sunday, March 12, and
at Mount Vernon, March 15, where he again settled down to the life of a
private gentleman, free from the cares and concerns of public life.

March 28, 1797, he was waited on at Mount Vernon by Brothers Dennis
Ramsay and Phillip G. Marsteller, and presented with the following
letter and address from James Gillies, the Master of Alexandria Lodge,
No. 22, of Virginia, viz.:

     "ALEXA March 28th, 5797.

     "_Most respected Brother_,

     "Brother Ramsay & Marsteller wait upon you
     "with a copy of an address which has been prepared
     "by the unanimous desire of the Ancient York Ma-
     "sons of Lodge No. 22. It is their earnest request
     "that you will partake of a Dinner with them and
     "that you will please appoint the time most conve-
     "nient for you to attend.--

        "I am most beloved Brother,
          "Your Mo. Obt Hble Servt
            "JAMES GILLIES, _M._

     "Genl Geo Washington."


The letter was an invitation to dine with the Lodge. This WASHINGTON
accepted.

     "_Most respected Brother_,

     "The ancient York Masons of Lodge No. 22 offer you
     "their warmest congratulations on your retire-
     "ment from your useful labors. Under the su-
     "preme architect of the Universe you have been the
     "Master Workman in erecting the Temple of Lib-
     "erty in the west, on the broad basis of equal rights.
     "In your wise administration of the government of
     "the United States for the space of eight years, you
     "have kept within the compass of our happy Consti-
     "tution and acted on the square with foreign Na-
     "tions and thereby preserved your country in peace
     "and promoted the prosperity and happiness of your
     "fellow Citizens, and now that you have retired from
     "the labours of public life to the refreshment of
     "domestic tranquility, they ardently pray that you
     "may long enjoy all the happiness which the Terres-
     "tial Lodge can afford and finally be removed to that
     "celestial Lodge where Love, Peace and Harmony
     "for ever reign and where cherubims and seraphims
     "shall hail you Brother.--

          "No. 22
            "JAMES GILLIES, _Master_."

     "Gen Geo Washington.


WASHINGTON attended the meeting of his Lodge at Alexandria, on Saturday,
April 1, 1797, when his reply to Brother Gillies' address was read in
open Lodge, viz.:

     "BROTHERS OF THE ANCIENT YORK MASONS OF
       "LODGE NO. 22.

     "While my heart acknowledges with Brotherly
     "Love, your affectionate congratulations on my re-
     "tirement from the arduous toils of past years, my
     "gratitude is no less excited by your kind wishes for
     "my future happiness.--

     "If it has pleased the supreme architect of the
     "universe to make me an humble instrument to pro-
     "mote the welfare and happiness of my fellow men,
     "my exertions have been abundantly recompensed
     "by the kind partiality with which they have been
     "received; and the assurance you give me of your
     "belief that I have acted upon the square in my

After which the Brethren went in procession from their room to Abert's
Tavern,[60] where they partook of an "elegant" dinner, following which a
number of toasts were offered. The tenth toast was by Brother
WASHINGTON, "The Lodge at Alexandria, and all Masons throughout the
World," after which he returned to Mount Vernon under an escort of
mounted troops of the town.[61]

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF MASSACHUSETTS, MARCH, 1797.


At a Grand Lodge in Quarterly Communication, held at Concert Hall,
Boston, on the evening of March 18, A.L. 5797.

     "On motion it was Voted, That a committee be appointed to draft an
     Address, to be presented to our Illustrious Brother, George
     Washington, Esq'r, when the M.W. Paul Revere, Grand Master, R.W.
     John Warren, Rev. Bro. Thaddeus M. Harris, R.W. Josiah Bartlett,
     Bro. Thomas Edwards, were appointed a committee for that purpose."


In response to above resolution the following address was sent to
Brother WASHINGTON at Mount Vernon dated Boston, March 21, 5797, viz.:

     "_The East, the West and the South, of the Grand Lodge of Free and
     Accepted Masons of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts._

     _To Their Most Worthy George Washington._"

     "Wishing ever to be foremost in testimonials of respect and
     admiration for those virtues and services with which you have so
     long adorned and benefited our common country; and not the last nor
     least, to regret the cessation of them, in the public councils of
     the Union; your Brethren of the Grand Lodge embrace the earliest
     opportunity of greeting you in the calm retirement you have
     contemplated to yourself. Though as citizens they lose you in the
     active labors of political life, they hope, as Masons, to find you
     in the pleasing sphere of Fraternal engagement.

     "From the cares of state and the fatigues of public business our
     institution opens a recess affording all the relief of tranquility,
     the harmony of peace and the refreshment of pleasure. Of these may
     you partake in all their purity and satisfaction; and we will
     assure ourselves that your attachment to this social plan will
     increase; and that under the auspices of your encouragement,
     assistance and patronage, the Craft will attain its highest
     ornament, perfection and praise. And it is our ardent prayer, that
     when your light shall be no more visible in this earthly temple,
     you may be raised to the All Perfect Lodge above; be seated on the
     right of the Supreme Architect of the Universe, and there receive
     the refreshment your labors merited.

     "In behalf of the Grand Lodge, we subscribe ourselves with the
     highest esteem,

        "Your affectionate Brethren,
          "PAUL REVERE, _Grand Master_.

     "Daniel Oliver, Grand Secretary,
       "Boston, 21st March, 5797."


For some unaccountable reason the delivery of the address was delayed
and not received at Mount Vernon until late in April. The original draft
of WASHINGTON's reply to the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts in his own
handwriting and signature as well as an autograph note of apology for
the seeming delay to Grand Master Paul Revere and his officers dated
Mount Vernon, April 24, 1797, are in the Manuscript Department in the
Library of Congress, viz.:

     "of the Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and

     "of Massachusetts transmitted under your
     "signatures, should appear so much out
                   from
     "of season; but ^ the lapse of time between
     "the date & reception of the address (from
     "what cause I know not) it was not to be

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GRAND LODGE OF MARYLAND, NOVEMBER, 1798.


In the year 1798, the danger of a war with France had become so
imminent, on account of the aggressions of that government towards the
United States, that Congress ordered a provisional army to be raised,
the command of which was tendered to WASHINGTON, with the rank of
Lieutenant-General, an honor which was reluctantly accepted by
WASHINGTON. During the summer a scourge of yellow fever had again
visited Philadelphia, which caused Congress to adjourn, July 16, and the
public offices to be removed for the time being to Trenton, N. J. All
danger of the fever being over, WASHINGTON, on November 5, started for
Trenton. He arrived at Baltimore, November 7, and was waited on at his
quarters by William Belton, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland,
his Deputy and other Brethren and presented with a copy of the New
Ahiman Rezon and the following address,[62] viz.:

     "TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQ.,
     Lieutenant General and Commander-in-chief of the Armies of the
     United States.

     "_Sir and Brother:_

     "The Right Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free Masons for the State of
     Maryland, wishing to testify the respect in which the whole
     fraternity in this State hold the man who is at once the ornament
     of the Society and of his country, vote a copy of the Constitution
     of Masonry, lately printed under its authority, to be presented to
     you.

     "Accept, Sir and Brother, from our hands this small token of the
     veneration of men who consider it as the greatest boast of their
     Society, that a WASHINGTON openly avows himself a member of it, and
     thinks it worthy of his approbation. With it accept also our
     warmest congratulations in the name of the body which we represent,
     on your reappointment to that elevated station in which you
     formerly wrought the salvation of your country; and on your
     restoration to the inestimable blessing of health which, that the
     Almighty disposer of events may continue to accord to you
     uninterruptedly, is the most earnest prayer of your most
     respectfully affectionate Brethren and most humble servants.

=FAC-SIMILE (REDUCED) OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF WASHINGTON'S LETTER TO THE
GRAND LODGE OF MARYLAND.--ELKTON, MD., NOV. 8, 1798.=


To this address WASHINGTON sent a reply, the original draft of which is
in the Library of Congress, written upon two pages of a letter sheet,
and differs somewhat from the final copy sent to the Grand Lodge from
Elkton, where WASHINGTON spent the next day. It will be recalled that
but two weeks had elapsed since he wrote his last letter to Dominie
Snyder of Fredericktown, and this fact was evidently in his mind when he
wrote this letter to the Maryland Brethren.

Upon second thought he eliminated the lines bearing upon the
insinuations in Snyder's letter. Following is a copy of the letter as
originally written, viz.:

     "TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL GRAND LODGE OF FREE
       "MASONS FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND.

     "_Gentlemen & Brothers_,

     "Your obliging & affectionate
     "letter, together with a copy of the Constitutions of
     "Masonry has been put into my hands by
     "your Grand Master; for which I pray you to
     "accept my best thanks.--

     "So far as I am
     "acquainted with the principles & Doctrines of
     "Free Masonry, I conceive it to be founded
     "in benevolence and to be exercised only
     "for the good of mankind. _If it has been a
     "Cloak to promote improper or nefarious
     "objects, it is a melancholly proof that
     "in unworthy hands, the best institutions
     "may be made use of to promote the worst
     "designs._--

     "While I offer my grateful
     "acknowledgements for your congratulations on my
     "late appointments, and for the favorable sentiments
     "you are pleased to express of my conduct, permit
     "me to observe, that at this important &
     "critical moment, when repeated and
     "high indignities have been offered to this
     "government your country and the rights & property
     "of our Citizens plundered without a prospect of
     "redress, I conceive it to be the _indispensable_
     "duty of every American, let his situation & cir
     "cumstances in life be what they may, to come
     "forward in support of the government of his country
     "and to give all the aid in his power toward
     "maintaining that independence which we have
     "so dearly purchased; and under this impression,
     "I did not hesitate to lay aside all personal
     "considerations and accept my appointment.

     "I pray you to be assured that I ap-
     "preciate, with sincerity your kind wishes for
     "my health & happiness.

Before this letter was sent, the five words on the tenth line and the
whole of next five lines were eliminated; there was also a slight change
made in the last paragraph on the second page.

Following is a copy of the letter as received by the Grand Lodge of
Maryland. The original letter was in the possession of the Grand Lodge
of Maryland, as late as 1833, but it has since disappeared.[63]

     "TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL GRAND LODGE OF FREE MASONS FOR THE STATE OF

     Constitution of Masonry, has been put into my hands by your Grand
     Master, for which I pray you to accept my best thanks. So far as I
     am acquainted with the principles and doctrines of Freemasonry, I
     conceive them to be founded on benevolence, and to be exercised for
     the good of mankind; I cannot, therefore, upon this ground
     withdraw my approbation from it.

     "While I offer my grateful acknowledgements for your
     congratulations on my late appointment, and for the favorable
     sentiments you are pleased to express of my conduct, permit me to
     observe, that, at this important and critical moment, when high and
     repeated indignities have been offered to the Government of our
     country, and when the property of our citizens is plundered without
     a prospect of redress, I conceive it to be the indispensable duty

CORRESPONDENCE WITH G. W. SNYDER, 1798.


As to the correspondence with one G. W. Snyder (Schneider), who
represented himself as a preacher of the Reformed Church of
Fredericktown, Maryland, our late Brother James M. Lamberton, in his
address before the Right Worshipful Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, at the
celebration of the "Sesqui-centennial Aniversary of the initiation of
Brother GEORGE WASHINGTON into the Fraternity of Freemasons," held in
the Masonic Temple, in the City of Philadelphia on Wednesday, November
the fifth, A. D. 1902, states:[64]

     "It is well known that during the French Revolution religion was
     dethroned, and reason installed in the place of Deity. The
     spreading of such doctrines was by many ascribed to the
     'Illuminati,' who were supposed to be Masons. During this period
     clubs like the Jacobin Clubs in France were formed in this
     country, and the spread of these doctrines was greatly feared,
     especially by the clergy, and in 1798 one of them, one G. W.
     Snyder, of Fredericktown, Maryland, wrote to Washington sending at
     the same time a book entitled 'Proofs of a Conspiracy,' etc., by
     John Robison,[65] the conspiracy being 'to overturn all government
     and all religion'."[66]


This letter, sent to WASHINGTON at Mount Vernon covered no less than six
pages; following is a verbatim copy of the original now in the Library
of Congress.

     "TO HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.

     "_Sir_,--You will, I hope, not think it a Pre | sumption in a
     Stranger, whose Name, | perhaps never reached your Ears, to ad | dress
     himself to you, the Commanding | General of a great Nation. I am a |
     German, born and liberally educated | in the city of Heydelberg, in
     the Pa | latinate of the Rhine. I came to this | Country in 1776, and
     felt soon after my | arrival, a close Attachment to the | Liberty for
     which these confederated | States then struggled. The same
     attachment | still remains not glowing, but burning in | my Breast.
     At the same Time that I am | exulting in the Measures adopted by
     our | Government, I feel myself elevated in | the Idea of my adopted
     Country, I am | attached, both from the Bent of Educa | tion and
     mature Enquiry and Search | to the simple Doctrines of Christianity, |
     which I have the Honor to teach in | Public; and I do heartily
     Despise all the | Cavils of Infidelity. Our present Time | pregnant
     with the most shocking Events | and Calamities, threatens Ruin to |
     our Liberty and Government. | The most secret Plans are in
     Agitation; | Plans calculated to ensnare the Unwary, | to attract the
     Gay irreligious, and to | entice even the Well-Disposed to combine
     in | the general Machine for overturning all | Government and all
     Religion.

     "It was some Time since that a Book | fell into my hands, entitled
     'Proofs | of a Conspiracy, &c. by John Robison,' which | gives a full
     Account of a Society of Free | Masons, that distinguishes itself by
     the | name of 'Illuminati,' whose Plan is to over | throw all
     Government and all Religion, even | natural; and who endeavor to
     eradicate | every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distin | guish Man from
     Beast by his shape only. | A Thought suggested itself to me, that
     some | of the Lodges in the United States might | have caught the
     Infection, and might co-oper | ate with the Illuminati or the Jacobin
     Club | in France. Fauchet is mentioned by Robinson | as a zealous
     Member; and who can doubt | Genet and Adet? Have not these their
     con | fidants in this country? They use the same | Expressions, and
     are generally Men of no | Religion. Upon serious Reflection I was
     led | to think that it might be within your | Power to prevent the
     horrid Plan from | corrupting the Brethren of the English Lodges |
     over which you preside.

     "I send you the 'Proof of a Conspiracy,' &c. | which I doubt not,
     will give you Satis | faction, and afford you matter for a | Train of
     ideas, that may operate to our | national Felicity. If, however, you
     have | already perused the Book, it will not, | I trust, be
     disagreeable to you that I | have presumed to address you with this |
     Letter and the Book accompanying it. | It proceeded from the
     Sincerity of my | Heart, and my ardent Wishes for the | common Good.

     "May the Supreme Ruler of all | Things continue You long with us in |
     these perilous Times: may he endow you | with Strength and Wisdom to
     save our | Country in the threating Storms and | gathering Clouds of
     Factions and Com | motions! and after you have completed his | Work,
     on this terrene Spot, may He | bring you to the full Possession of
     the | glorious Liberty of the Children of God, | is the hearty and

This man Snyder (Schneider) was an agitator and thoroughly irresponsible
person, having no ecclesiastical connection with any organized Church
Body.

In the year 1787, Schneider came from Albany, New York, to Frederick,
ostensibly to collect money to build a Church. He was kindly received
and permitted to preach in the Reformed Congregation, where he soon
fomented discord and trouble.

Schneider was soon driven out of Frederick Town, but returned again in
1794, when he renewed the trouble in the Church, which ended in a
schism. The matter finally got into the Civil Court, and on February 15,
1800 the case was decided against him, which ended his activity in
Frederick Town; soon after which he left for parts unknown.[67]

Snyder, who was not a native of this country, evidently labored under
the impression that WASHINGTON was a Grand Master General, who presided
over all of the English (or Symbolic) Masonic Lodges in the United
States. Snyder evidently used the term "English" Lodges, to distinguish
them from the Masonic bodies working in the so-called higher (Scotch)
degrees, as are now known as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

How important WASHINGTON considered this correspondence is shown by his
precaution in taking a press copy of both of his letters to Snyder, who
he was led to believe was the regular pastor of the German Reformed
Congregation at Fredericktown. These are now in the Library of Congress.
It will be noted that in all of his other Masonic correspondence, copies
were made in his regular letter books by his clerks, of both address and
reply. Brother WASHINGTON evidently surmised that this letter from
Snyder was nothing more or less than a scheme to entrap him. It was not
until a month had elapsed, and then only after due consideration, that
the following reply was sent to Fredericktown, viz.:

     "MOUNT VERNON, 25th Sept. 1798.

     "_Sir_,

     "Many apologies are
     "due to you, for my not acknowledging
     "the receipt of your obliging favour of
                      for

     "had the goodness to send me.

     "farious & dangerous plan, & doctrines
     "of the Illuminati, but never saw the
     "Book until you were pleased to send
     "it to me. The same causes which
     "have prevented my acknowledging the
     "receipt of your letter, have prevented
     "my reading the Book, hitherto, name-
     "ly, the multiplicity of matters which
                  me
     "pressed upon before, & the debilitated

     "vere fever had been removed, and
     "which allows me to add little more now,
     "than thanks for your kind wishes and
     "favourable sentiments, except to cor-
     "rect an error you have run into, of my
     "presiding over the English Lodges in

     "none, nor have I been in one, more than
                                  thirty

=FAC-SIMILE OF PRESS COPY OF WASHINGTON'S SECOND LETTER TO REV. G. W.
SNYDER.--OCTOBER 24, 1798.=


In this letter WASHINGTON was correct in stating that he had not
presided over the "English Lodges in this Country," undoubtedly meaning
as Grand Master General.

Where WASHINGTON says "_The fact is I preside over none_," he meant that
he did not then preside over any individual lodge, as he at that time
was a Past Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 22, of Virginia.[68]

Where he says "_Nor have I been in one_, [meaning an individual lodge]
_more than once or twice within the last thirty years_," he obviously
had in view his occasional visits to the various lodges during that
period, and that he could not, on account of his official duties and
other conditions, attend any lodge regularly.

As a matter of record, WASHINGTON was a member of Alexandria Lodge, No.
39, of Pennsylvania,[69] and attended some of its meetings at Alexandria
in 1783 and 1784, as is shown by the Minutes of the Lodge, and the
records here presented.[70] Further, that when the Brethren of
Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, changed their allegiance from Pennsylvania to
Virginia, General WASHINGTON was especially named in the warrant, after
his consent having been first obtained,[71] and thereby became the
Warrant Master of Lodge No. 22, under the Virginia jurisdiction, April
28, 1788, serving as such until December 20 following, when, as the
minutes of that date show,[72] he was unanimously elected to succeed
himself for the full term, serving in all about twenty months.

The records further show that, in 1778, WASHINGTON occupied the chief
position in the procession at the celebration of St. John the Evangelist
by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1778, in which
more than three hundred Brethren joined.[73]

He also occupied the same position when he laid the corner stone of the
present capitol at Washington, September 18, 1793, clothed with the
Masonic Apron presented by Lafayette, which is now in the Museum of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Upon both of these occasions, WASHINGTON
made a public profession of his membership in the Masonic Fraternity.

Records show that WASHINGTON was present at the meeting of American
Union Lodge (a Military Lodge), at Morristown, N. J., December 27,
1779;[74] at American Union Lodge at Nelson's point on the Hudson June
24, 1782;[75] at King Solomon's Lodge of Poughkeepsie, December 27,
1782, and occasionally at Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, in 1783-1784, and
the Virginia Lodge, No. 22, between the years 1788 and 1797.[76]

WASHINGTON in the next paragraph of his letter to Snyder makes his
meaning absolutely clear, that while he had not attended any Lodge
regularly during the past thirty years he plainly states: "I believe
notwithstanding, that none of the Lodges in this Country are
contaminated with the principles ascribed to the society of the
Illuminati."

This belief is further accentuated by the letter to the Grand Lodge of
Maryland a few weeks after the above letter was written to Snyder.

In addition to above records, there are numerous traditions of
WASHINGTON's occasional visits to Masonic Lodges and functions:[77] all
of which fall within the thirty years mentioned in the Snyder
Letter.[78]

Further, WASHINGTON's great interest in Freemasonry is shown by the
many addresses received from different Grand and Subordinate Lodges
throughout the Union, all of which he acknowledged in fraternal terms,
also by the various Masonic constitutions and sermons dedicated to him,
which he received with thanks and were preserved in his library.

It will be noted that in the fifth line from the bottom, "_Within the
last thirty years_," which in all Anti-Masonic publications is printed
in italics, the word "_thirty_" was not in the body of the letter as
originally written, but was an afterthought and interlined before the
press copy was taken.

In the press copy of this letter, it will be noted that the word written
over the words "_last years_," is almost indecipherable; in the
photostat it is completely so. This has led some investigators to
question whether the interlined word is really "_thirty_."

The surmise that the blur in the press copy of WASHINGTON's letter to
Snyder, was "thirty" was first promulgated by Jared Sparks, when he
furnished the text of the letter to the Anti-Masonic agitators, during
the political excitement which swept over the New England States in the
second decade of the nineteenth century.

Snyder, upon receipt of this letter, undoubtedly after consultation with
persons who were politically opposed to WASHINGTON or antagonistic to
the Masonic Fraternity, wrote a second letter and sent it to Mount
Vernon under date of October 17, 1798; no copy of this letter has thus
far been found among the WASHINGTON papers in the Library of Congress.

WASHINGTON immediately sent the following sharp reply to Snyder, in
which he plainly sets forth his belief that the Masonic Lodges in the
United States were not interested in the propagation of the tenets of
what was then known as Jacobism or the Illuminati. The words as
underscored in the original letter by WASHINGTON were to emphasize his
meaning upon this subject.

Photostats of both of the above letter press copies are in the Archives
of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.

     "MOUNT VERNON 24th Oct. 1798.

     "_Rev. Sir_,

     "I have you favor of the
                                         tive
     "17th instant before me and my only mo:
     "to trouble you with the receipt of this let
     "ter, is to explain, and correct a mistake
     "which I perceive the hurry in which I
     "am obliged, often to write letters, have
     "led you into.--

     "It was not my intention to doubt
     "that, the doctrines of the Illuminati, and
     "principles of Jacobism had not spread
     "in the United States. On the contrary, no
     "one is more, fully satisfied of this fact
     "that I am.

     "The idea I meant to convey, was,
     "that I did not believe that the _Lodges_
     "of Free Masons in _this_ Country had, as
     "_Societies_, endeavoured to propagate the
     "diabolical tenets of the first, or the per-
     "nicious principles of the latter, (if they
     "are susceptible of separation) That
     "individuals of them may have done it, or
     "that the _founder_, or _instrument_ employ
     "ed to found the Democratic Societies
     "in the United States, may have had these
     "objects, and actually had a separation
     "of the _people_ from their _Government_
     "in view, is too evident to be questioned.

     "My occupations are such, that
     "but little leisure is allowed me to read News
     "Papers, or Books of any kind. The reading
     "of letters and preparing answers, absorb
     "much of my time.--

        "With respect,--I remain,

              "Go. Washington"

     "The Revd.
       "Mr Snyder."
     Endorsed
     to
     "The Revd Mr Snyder,
     "24th Oct. 1798."


It is a historical fact that WASHINGTON had always retained the highest
respect for the people of Maryland, and especially the citizens of
Frederick County. No man ever stood higher in the estimation of the
people of Maryland than WASHINGTON, and his death awakened genuine
sorrow. On February 22d, 1800, memorial services were observed in the
Reformed Church at Fredericktown.[79] It was a solemn day and the whole
County was in mourning; at which time Ex-Governor Thomas Johnson
pronounced the funeral oration. Snyder took no part in these services.

The two letters to Snyder were chiefly relied upon by the Anti-Masons to
support their political claims.

     "That Washington was never in a Lodge but twice, in his life; that
     he paid no attention to Masonry during the war; that in 1781 he
     declined being addressed by Masons as a brother Mason, and in 1798
     was very particular to insist upon the fact that he had not been in
     a Lodge, but once or twice in 30 years, and knew nothing of their
     principles and practices."[80]


How false these statements so frequently made, is shown by the many
proofs here presented in fac-simile of the originals, which also
absolutely controvert the statement in Governor Ritner's Vindication?
viz:--

     "That all the letters said to be written by Washington to Lodges
     are spurious. This is rendered nearly certain: First, by the
     non-production of the originals: Second, by the absence of copies
     among the records of his letters: Third, by their want of dates:
     Fourth, by the fact that his intimate friend and biographer, Chief
     Justice Marshall,[81] (himself a Mason in his youth,) says that he
     never heard Washington utter a syllable on the subject, a matter
     nearly impossible, if Washington had for years been engaged in
     writing laudatory letters to the Grand Lodges of South Carolina,
     Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts."[82]


The movement to elect General WASHINGTON a Grand Master over all the
Brethren in the United States originated at a meeting of American Union
Lodge, held at the encampment of the American Army at Morristown, New
Jersey, December 15, 1779. This Lodge was a Regimental Lodge of the
Connecticut Line, originally warranted by the Provincial Grand Master of
Massachusetts.

This movement continued to find favor amongst the craft, especially in
Pennsylvania, and culminated in a motion to that effect at a General
Grand Communication of the Grand Lodge, December 20, 1779.

This resulted in a Grand Lodge of Emergency being convened January 13,
1780, when the following action was taken:[83]

     "This Lodge being called by Order of the Grand Master, upon the
     request of Sundry Brethren, and also in pursuance of a Motion made
     at the last General Communication, to consider the Propriety as
     well as the necessity of appointing a Grand Master over all the
     Grand Lodges formed or to be formed in these United States, as the
     Correspondence which the Rules of Masonry require cannot now be
     carried on with the Grand Lodge of London, under whose Jurisdiction
     the Grand Lodges in these States were originally constituted; The
     Ballot was put upon the Question: Whether it be for the Benefit of
     Masonry that 'a Grand Master of Masons thro'out the United States'
     shall be now nominated on the part of this Grand Lodge; and it was
     unanimously determined in the affirmative.

     "Sundry respectable Brethren being then put in nomination, it was
     moved that the Ballot be put for them separately, and His
     Excellency George Washington, Esquire, General and
     Commander-in-chief of the Armies of the United States being first
     in nomination, he was ballotted for accordingly as Grand Master,
     and Elected by the unanimous vote of the whole Lodge.

     "Ordered, That the minutes of this Election and appointment be
     transmitted to the different Grand Lodges in the United States, and
     their Concurrence therein be requested, in Order that application
     be made to his Excellency in due form, praying that he will do the
     Brethren and Craft the honor of accepting their appointment. A
     Committee was appointed to expedite the Business."


The movement was further advanced at a Convention of representatives of
the Army Lodges, held at Morristown, N. J., on February 7, 1780, when,
fortified by the pronounced action of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, a
committee was chosen of which Brother Mordecai Gist of Maryland was
chairman and Brother Otho Williams of Delaware, secretary.[84]


=FAC-SIMILE OF FINAL LETTER FROM BOSTON, ENDING THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE
GEN. WASHINGTON GENERAL GRAND MASTER.=


This Committee issued the celebrated address:

     "To the RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, The Grand Masters of the several Lodges
     in the Respective United States of America.

         "UNION----FORCE----LOVE."


This address was signed by representatives of no less than seven states,
viz.: Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
Bay, New York and Delaware; in addition to those of the American Union
Lodge, Artillery, St. John's Regimental Lodge and the Staff of the
American Army.

It was further ordered that the foregoing address with an exact copy of
these proceedings signed by the President and Secretary, be sent to the
respective Provincial Grand Masters in the United States.[85]

It was not until the middle of October that a reply was received from
the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to the circular letter sent out by the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, and then only in response to a letter
written by our Grand Secretary, Rev. Brother Dr. William Smith.

This matter led to more or less correspondence between the Grand Lodges
of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and was in abeyance, until January,
1781, when the following letter was received from Joseph Webb, Grand
Master of Massachusetts.[86]


     "BOSTON, Jany 17, 1781.

     "_Revd Sir and
     "Respected Brother_

     "Last Friday Evening the Grand Lodge met, agreeable to adjournment
     and after a long debate on the subject, whether it was expedient at
     present to elect a Grand Master General for the United States, it
     passed in the negative.

     "Inclosed I transmit you the vote from the G. Sec'y.

        "Yr Affecte Brother
          "& Hble Servt
            "Jos: WEBB.

     "Rev Dr Smith
       "Philadelphia."


The belief that WASHINGTON was the Grand Master of the United States was
widespread, and, as our late Bro. James M. Lamberton said in his address
before mentioned,[87] notwithstanding the fact that the project to
elevate General WASHINGTON fell through, "that the action of the Army
Lodges and of our Grand Lodge got abroad, is shown by translations of
two letters from a Lodge at Cape Francois,[88] on the island of San
Domingo, directed to General WASHINGTON as Grand Master of all America,
soliciting a charter, which were presented to our Grand Lodge, February
3, 1786. The same thing is shown by a medal struck in 1797, the obverse
showing the bust of WASHINGTON, with the legend, "G. Washington
President. 1797," the reverse showing many Masonic emblems,[89] with the
legend "Amor. Honor. Et Justica G.W.G.G.M." (_i. e.,_ George Washington,
General Grand Master).

The writer of the letters to WASHINGTON, Snyder, quoted at the beginning
of this chapter, being of foreign birth, and not a member of the Masonic
Fraternity, nor even living where a Masonic Lodge existed, evidently
labored under the same delusion as the Brethren at Cape Francois.

The Masonic Correspondence of WASHINGTON as represented upon these
pages, should settle for all time to come the question, as to the esteem
in which WASHINGTON held the Masonic Fraternity, of which he was an
honored Member.

It is stated that there are still a large number of Washington papers in
the Library of Congress, that are not accessible, as they have thus far
not been classified or indexed. Thus it is in the possibilities that
there may be still further documentary evidence found of Masonic import,
in addition to such as are set forth upon these pages.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
