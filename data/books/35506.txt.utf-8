PREFACE.

"Of making many books there is no end," said a wise man; but probably
he had good cooks. There is a "place" for all things as well as a
"time," and every hungry man knows the place for a good dinner. If
the shortest road to man's heart is by way of his stomach, then the
projectors of this little volume think they have struck it rich. So,
like all other authors, we have written to meet a "long felt want."
There are cook-books and cook-books, but who ever saw a cook-book for
"Cloud City"? It is a well-established fact that in a high altitude
the science culinary has its local and peculiar laws. It is commonly
held that a different proportion of ingredients is necessary, as well
as a different length of time. It is even claimed by some that more
fuel is required here than in a lower altitude. Be this as it may, it
is well established that the husband, who has recently brought his
wife from the East, is not in healthy employment when he reminds her
of the superior quality of his mother's cooking. He must wait until
she has learned the new conditions in her new world. Without a
scientific explanation of why the boiling point is reached at lower
temperature here than at lower altitude, or whether this one fact
accounts for the necessity of different proportions of ingredients in
cookery, the Ladies of the Congregational Church gracefully bow
themselves before the public with a genuine blessing to every family.
Poor cooking is responsible for much of the wretched health of women
and children, and much of the drinking habit among men. If, by
gathering together in this little volume the wisest experience,
wrought out in the peculiar conditions of this lofty altitude, we are
able to bring peace and happiness to the home, our ambition shall
have been amply satisfied.

SOUPS.

PEA SOUP.

Parboil the peas in saleratus water (one heaping teaspoon to kettle
two-thirds full of water), then wash well and put in to boil with a

One pint of black beans, a small joint or shank of beef, a slice of

five hours; strain through the colander. Season with red pepper and a
little wine. Add the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs and slices of
lemon.--Mrs. Werner.

bread cut in very thin slices and dried, two tablespoons of grated
cheese. Slowly stir the onions in the butter one hour, stirring
frequently, being very careful not to brown; add salt, pepper,
cayenne and stock, and cook one hour longer. Add one-third as much
stock. Have in the tureen the bread and cheese. Beat up the eggs with
a ladle full of soup; pour this on the bread, cover close, and stand

* * *

FRENCH CREAM CANDY.

(uncooked.)

Mix whites of two eggs and their bulk in water in a large bowl; beat
very well, add a dessert spoon vanilla and about two pounds "XXX"
confectioners' sugar (finest grade of powdered sugar), well sifted;
beat well, and the paste is ready. Take half a pound of dates, remove
stones, put in a piece of the candy paste and roll each one in
granulated sugar.

For Fig Candy, split half a pound of figs, place a layer of the dough
on a board (first sprinkle well with powdered sugar to prevent its
adhering), then a layer of figs, again a layer of dough, and cut in
squares.

Nuts of any kind may be made up into candy by using the meats for the
foundation or inside of little balls of paste, and then roll in
coarse sugar; set each kind out in a cool place to harden.

For Chocolate Creams roll any number of balls size of small marbles
from the dough, and when they are hardened, dip with a fork into some
Baker's chocolate melted on the stove. Be careful not to allow it
To boil; better to melt it in a little cup placed in a pan of hot
Water on the stove. Or make a caramel of three-fourths pint sugar,
one-third pint milk, two tablespoons butter, and one square chocolate.
Boil twenty minutes and add one teaspoon vanilla. Remove from fire,
place in a pan of hot water, and dip in the little balls.

Cocoanut Candy may be made by rolling out another portion of the
dough on the floured board, sprinkle with cocoanut, roll a few times
with the roller, and cut into squares.

A mixture of cocoanut and nuts chopped fine makes a delicious candy.

For English Walnut Candy split the walnuts, shape some of the dough
into round flat balls, place a half of the nut on each and press
firmly. Use hickory-nut meats for Hickory-Nut Candy.



HOUSEHOLD HINTS.

To clean the silver spoons and forks in everyday use, rub them with a
damp cloth dipped in baking soda, then polish them with a small piece
of chamois skin.

* * *

Rub salt on the inside of your coffee pot when washing it, and it
will remove the coffee and egg very quickly. Be sure to rinse it
thoroughly before using it again.

* * *

Old lamp burners should be boiled often in strong saleratus water.
Let them boil for an hour, polish them, and they will be as good as
new, and will not trouble you by causing a smoky light.

* * *

Brooms become very brittle in this dry atmosphere; dipping them in
hot suds every week will toughen them, so they will last much
longer.

* * *

Cut old boot tops into pieces the right size, cover with calico, and
you have a holder that will not heat the hand.

* * *

JAVELLE WATER.

TO BLEACH AND REMOVE STAINS.

Four pounds sal-soda, one pound chloride of lime, one gallon water.
Heat the sal soda in a vessel over the fire, add the water boiling.
Boil ten minutes. Add the chloride of lime, having first reduced it
to powder. When cold, bottle and cork the mixture. Rinse well after
using.

* * *

CLEANING FLUID.

Sulphuric ether, one drachm; chloroform, one drachm; alcohol, two
drachms; deodorized benzine, two pints; oil of wintergreen, two
drachms. Nice for cleaning kid gloves, grease spots, etc.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
