Book 26 Ezekiel
001:001 Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month],
        in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives
        by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw
        visions of God.
001:002 In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year
        of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
001:003 the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son
        of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar;
        and the hand of Yahweh was there on him.
001:004 I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north,
        a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness round
        about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal,
        out of the midst of the fire.
001:005 Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures.
        This was their appearance:  they had the likeness of a man.
001:006 Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
001:007 Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet
        was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled
        like burnished brass.
001:008 They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides;
        and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]:
001:009 their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn
        when they went; each one went straight forward.
001:010 As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man;
        and they four had the face of a lion on the right side;
        and they four had the face of an ox on the left side;
        they four had also the face of an eagle.
001:011 Their faces and their wings were separate above;
        two [wings] of each one were joined one to another, and two
        covered their bodies.
001:012 Each one went straight forward:  where the spirit was to go,
        they went; they didn't turn when they went.
001:013 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
        was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches:
        [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures;
        and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
001:014 The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance
        of a flash of lightning.
001:015 Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on
        the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four
        faces of it.
001:016 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl:
        and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their
        work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
001:017 When they went, they went in their four directions:
        they didn't turn when they went.
001:018 As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four
        had their rims full of eyes round about.
001:019 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them;
        and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
        the wheels were lifted up.
001:020 Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go:
        and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit
        of the living creature was in the wheels.
001:021 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
        and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels
        were lifted up beside them:  for the spirit of the living
        creature was in the wheels.
001:022 Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness
        of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on,
        stretched forth over their heads above.
001:023 Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward
        the other:  each one had two which covered on this side,
        and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
001:024 When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise
        of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise
        of tumult like the noise of an army:  when they stood,
        they let down their wings.
001:025 There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads:
        when they stood, they let down their wings.
001:026 Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of
        a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire{or, lapis lazuli} stone;
        and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance
        of a man on it above.
001:027 I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within
        it round about, from the appearance of his waist and upward;
        and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw
        as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness
        round about him.
001:028 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
        of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
        This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh.
        When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice
        of one that spoke.
002:001 He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will
        speak with you.
002:002 The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me
        on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
002:003 He said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel,
        to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me:
        they and their fathers have transgressed against me even
        to this very day.
002:004 The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you
        to them; and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh.
002:005 They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
        (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there
        has been a prophet among them.
002:006 You, son of man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid
        of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you
        do dwell among scorpions:  don't be afraid of their words,
        nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
002:007 You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear,
        or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
002:008 But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; don't be you
        rebellious like that rebellious house:  open your mouth,
        and eat that which I give you.
002:009 When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, behold,
        a scroll of a book was therein;
002:010 He spread it before me:  and it was written within and without;
        and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
003:001 He said to me, Son of man, eat that which you find;
        eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
003:002 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.
003:003 He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat,
        and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.
        Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
003:004 He said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel,
        and speak with my words to them.
003:005 For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of
        a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
003:006 not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language,
        whose words you can not understand.  Surely, if I sent you
        to them, they would listen to you.
003:007 But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will
        not listen to me:  for all the house of Israel are of hard
        forehead and of a stiff heart.
003:008 Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces,
        and your forehead hard against their foreheads.
003:009 As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead:
        don't be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks,
        though they are a rebellious house.
003:010 Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
        speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
003:011 Go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people,
        and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh;
        whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
003:012 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice
        of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Yahweh
        from his place.
003:013 [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they
        touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them,
        even the noise of a great rushing.
003:014 So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went
        in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh
        was strong on me.
003:015 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived
        by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there
        overwhelmed among them seven days.
003:016 It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh
        came to me, saying,
003:017 Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel:
        therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
003:018 When I tell the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him
        no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way,
        to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity;
        but his blood will I require at your hand.
003:019 Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn't turn from his wickedness,
        nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity;
        but you have delivered your soul.
003:020 Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness,
        and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him,
        he shall die:  because you have not given him warning,
        he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has
        done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require
        at your hand.
003:021 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous
        not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live,
        because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.
003:022 The hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise,
        go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.
003:023 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain:  and behold,
        the glory of Yahweh stood there, as the glory which I saw
        by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
003:024 Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet;
        and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself
        within your house.
003:025 But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you,
        and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:
003:026 and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth,
        that you shall be mute, and shall not be to them a reprover;
        for they are a rebellious house.
003:027 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you
        shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  He who hears,
        let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear:
        for they are a rebellious house.
004:001 You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before you,
        and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:
004:002 and lay siege against it, and build forts against it,
        and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it,
        and plant battering rams against it round about.
004:003 Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron
        between you and the city:  and set your face toward it,
        and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it.
        This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
004:004 Moreover lie you on your left side, and lay the iniquity of
        the house of Israel on it; [according to] the number of the days
        that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.
004:005 For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be
        to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days:
        so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
004:006 Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your
        right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah:
        forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it to you.
004:007 You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
        with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.
004:008 Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from
        one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days
        of your siege.
004:009 Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils,
        and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make
        you bread of it; [according to] the number of the days that
        you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days,
        shall you eat of it.
004:010 Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels
        a day:  from time to time shall you eat it.
004:011 You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin:
        from time to time shall you drink.
004:012 You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it
        in their sight with dung that comes out of man.
004:013 Yahweh said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their
        bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.
004:014 Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, my soul has not been polluted;
        for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten
        of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals;
        neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
004:015 Then he said to me, Behold, I have given you cow's dung
        for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread thereon.
004:016 Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff
        of bread in Jerusalem:  and they shall eat bread by weight,
        and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure,
        and in dismay:
004:017 that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another,
        and pine away in their iniquity.
005:001 You, son of man, take a sharp sword; [as] a barber's razor
        shall you take it to you, and shall cause it to pass on
        your head and on your beard:  then take balances to weigh,
        and divide the hair.
005:002 A third part shall you burn in the fire in the midst of the city,
        when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take
        a third part, and strike with the sword round about it;
        and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will
        draw out a sword after them.
005:003 You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.
005:004 Of these again shall you take, and cast them into the midst
        of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from it shall a fire
        come forth into all the house of Israel.
005:005 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This is Jerusalem; I have set her
        in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.
005:006 She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more
        than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries
        that are round about her; for they have rejected my ordinances,
        and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
005:007 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are turbulent
        more than the nations that are round about you, and have
        not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances,
        neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are
        round about you;
005:008 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I, even I,
        am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst
        of you in the sight of the nations.
005:009 I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I
        will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.
005:010 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you,
        and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
        judgments on you; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter
        to all the winds.
005:011 Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely, because you
        have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things,
        and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish [you];
        neither shall my eye spare, and I also will have no pity.
005:012 A third part of you shall die with the pestilence,
        and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you;
        and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you;
        and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will
        draw out a sword after them.
005:013 Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause
        my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted;
        and they shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal,
        when I have accomplished my wrath on them.
005:014 Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among
        the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all
        that pass by.
005:015 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and
        an astonishment, to the nations that are round about you,
        when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath,
        and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Yahweh, have spoken it;)
005:016 when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine,
        that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you:
        and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your
        staff of bread;
005:017 and I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they shall
        bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you;
        and I will bring the sword on you:  I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
006:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
006:002 Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel,
        and prophesy to them,
006:003 and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
        Lord Yahweh:  Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains
        and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys:
        Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will
        destroy your high places.
006:004 Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars
        shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men
        before your idols.
006:005 I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel
        before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round
        about your altars.
006:006 In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste,
        and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars
        may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be
        broken and cease, and your incense altars may be hewn down,
        and your works may be abolished.
006:007 The slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant, in that you shall have some that
        escape the sword among the nations, when you shall be scattered
        through the countries.
006:009 Those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations
        where they shall be carried captive, how that I have been
        broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me,
        and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols:
        and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils
        which they have committed in all their abominations.
006:010 They shall know that I am Yahweh:  I have not said in vain
        that I would do this evil to them.
006:011 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Smite with your hand, and stamp with
        your foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations
        of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword,
        by the famine, and by the pestilence.
006:012 He who is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he who is
        near shall fall by the sword; and he who remains and is
        besieged shall die by the famine:  thus will I accomplish
        my wrath on them.
006:013 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men shall be
        among their idols round about their altars, on every high hill,
        on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree,
        and under every thick oak, the places where they offered
        sweet savor to all their idols.
006:014 I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate
        and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all
        their habitations:  and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
007:001 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
007:002 You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land
        of Israel, An end:  the end is come on the four corners
        of the land.
007:003 Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you,
        and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring
        on you all your abominations.
007:004 My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity;
        but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations shall
        be in the midst of you:  and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
007:005 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  An evil, an only evil; behold, it comes.
007:006 An end is come, the end is come; it awakes against you;
        behold, it comes.
007:007 Your doom is come to you, inhabitant of the land:
        the time is come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult,
        and not [of] joyful shouting, on the mountains.
007:008 Now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my
        anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways;
        and I will bring on you all your abominations.
007:009 My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity:
        I will bring on you according to your ways; and your
        abominations shall be in the midst of you; and you shall know
        that I, Yahweh, do strike.
007:010 Behold, the day, behold, it comes:  your doom is gone forth;
        the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.
007:011 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them
        [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth:
        neither shall there be eminency among them.
007:012 The time is come, the day draws near:  don't let the buyer rejoice,
        nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all the multitude of it.
007:013 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
        although they be yet alive:  for the vision is touching
        the whole multitude of it, none shall return; neither shall
        any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
007:014 They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none
        goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all the multitude of it.
007:015 The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within:
        he who is in the field shall die with the sword:
        and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
007:016 But those of those who escape shall escape, and shall be on
        the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning,
        every one in his iniquity.
007:017 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
007:018 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
        cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness
        on all their heads.
007:019 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
        shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall
        not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Yahweh:
        they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels;
        because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.
007:020 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty;
        but they made the images of their abominations [and] their
        detestable things therein:  therefore have I made it to them
        as an unclean thing.
007:021 I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
        and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they
        shall profane it.
007:022 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane
        my secret [place]; and robbers shall enter into it,
        and profane it.
007:023 Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes,
        and the city is full of violence.
007:024 Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall
        possess their houses:  I will also make the pride of the strong
        to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
007:025 Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there
        shall be none.
007:026 Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor;
        and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law
        shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
007:027 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation,
        and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled:
        I will do to them after their way, and according to their
        own judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that
        I am Yahweh.
008:001 It happened in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth
        [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders
        of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell
        there on me.
008:002 Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire;
        from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and from
        his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness,
        as it were glowing metal.
008:003 He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head;
        and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky,
        and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem,
        to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks toward
        the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy,
        which provokes to jealousy.
008:004 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to
        the appearance that I saw in the plain.
008:005 Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way
        toward the north.  So I lifted up my eyes the way toward
        the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this
        image of jealousy in the entry.
008:006 He said to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great
        abominations that the house of Israel do commit here,
        that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but you shall
        again see yet other great abominations.
008:007 He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
        behold, a hole in the wall.
008:008 Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall:
        and when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door.
008:009 He said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that
        they do here.
008:010 So I went in and saw; and see, every form of creeping things,
        and abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel,
        portrayed on the wall round about.
008:011 There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house
        of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah
        the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand;
        and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.
008:012 Then said he to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders
        of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his
        chambers of imagery? for they say, Yahweh doesn't see us;
        Yahweh has forsaken the land.
008:013 He said also to me, You shall again see yet other great
        abominations which they do.
008:014 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh's house
        which was toward the north; and see, there sat the women
        weeping for Tammuz.
008:015 Then said he to me, Have you seen [this], son of man? you
        shall again see yet greater abominations than these.
008:016 He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh's house; and see,
        at the door of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch
        and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs
        toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward the east;
        and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.
008:017 Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], son of man?
        Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
        abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land
        with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger:
        and behold, they put the branch to their nose.
008:018 Therefore will I also deal in wrath; my eye shall not spare,
        neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears
        with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
009:001 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause you
        them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man
        with his destroying weapon in his hand.
009:002 Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate,
        which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter
        weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them
        clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side.
        They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.
009:003 The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
        whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house:
        and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's
        inkhorn by his side.
009:004 Yahweh said to him, Go through the midst of the city,
        through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads
        of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations
        that are done in the midst of it.
009:005 To the others he said in my hearing, Go you through
        the city after him, and strike:  don't let your eye spare,
        neither have you pity;
009:006 kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin,
        and little children and women; but don't come near any
        man on whom is the mark:  and begin at my sanctuary.
        Then they began at the old men that were before the house.
009:007 He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
        with the slain:  go you forth.  They went forth, and struck
        in the city.
009:008 It happened, while they were smiting, and I was left,
        that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Yahweh!
        will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring
        out of your wrath on Jerusalem?
009:009 Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
        Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood,
        and the city full of perversion:  for they say, Yahweh has
        forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn't see.
009:010 As for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity,
        but I will bring their way on their head.
009:011 Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by
        his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you
        have commanded me.
010:001 Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head
        of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire{or,
        lapis lazuli} stone, as the appearance of the likeness
        of a throne.
010:002 He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between
        the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both
        your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim,
        and scatter them over the city.  He went in as I watched.
010:003 Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house,
        when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
010:004 The glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub, [and stood]
        over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled
        with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness
        of Yahweh's glory.
010:005 The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to
        the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
010:006 It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen,
        saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between
        the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
010:007 The cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim
        to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [of it],
        and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen,
        who took it and went out.
010:008 There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand
        under their wings.
010:009 I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel
        beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub;
        and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.
010:010 As for their appearance, they four had one likeness,
        as if a wheel have been within a wheel.
010:011 When they went, they went in their four directions:
        they didn't turn as they went, but to the place where the head
        looked they followed it; they didn't turn as they went.
010:012 Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands,
        and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
        [even] the wheels that they four had.
010:013 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing,
        the whirling [wheels].
010:014 Every one had four faces:  the first face was the face
        of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man,
        and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face
        of an eagle.
010:015 The cherubim mounted up:  this is the living creature that I
        saw by the river Chebar.
010:016 When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when
        the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth,
        the wheels also didn't turn from beside them.
010:017 When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up,
        these mounted up with them:  for the spirit of the living
        creature was in them.
010:018 The glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house,
        and stood over the cherubim.
010:019 The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth
        in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them:
        and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh's house;
        and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
010:020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
        by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
010:021 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings;
        and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
010:022 As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I
        saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves;
        they went every one straight forward.
011:001 Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to
        the east gate of Yahweh's house, which looks eastward:
        and see, at the door of the gate twenty-five men;
        and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur,
        and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
011:002 He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity,
        and who give wicked counsel in this city;
011:003 who say, [The time] is not near to build houses:
        this [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
011:004 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.
011:005 The Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me,
        Speak, Thus says Yahweh:  Thus have you said, house of Israel;
        for I know the things that come into your mind.
011:006 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled
        the streets of it with the slain.
011:007 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Your slain whom you
        have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this
        [city] is the caldron; but you shall be brought forth out
        of the midst of it.
011:008 You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
011:009 I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you
        into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
011:010 You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border
        of Israel; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
011:011 This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh
        in the midst of it; I will judge you in the border of Israel;
011:012 and you shall know that I am Yahweh:  for you have not walked
        in my statutes, neither have you executed my ordinances,
        but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are
        round about you.
011:013 It happened, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
        of Benaiah died.  Then fell I down on my face, and cried
        with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Yahweh! will you make
        a full end of the remnant of Israel?
011:014 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
011:015 Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men
        of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them,
        [are they] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,
        Get you far from Yahweh; to us is this land given for a possession.
011:016 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Whereas I have removed
        them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered
        them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary
        for a little while in the countries where they are come.
011:017 Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will gather you
        from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you
        have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
011:018 They shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable
        things of it and all the abominations of it from there.
011:019 I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you;
        and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will
        give them a heart of flesh;
011:020 that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances,
        and do them:  and they shall be my people, and I will
        be their God.
011:021 But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their
        detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their
        way on their own heads, says the Lord Yahweh.
011:022 Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels
        were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was
        over them above.
011:023 The glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city,
        and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
011:024 The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by
        the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
        So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
011:025 Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh
        had shown me.
012:001 The word of Yahweh also came to me, saying,
012:002 Son of man, you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house,
        who have eyes to see, and don't see, who have ears to hear,
        and don't hear; for they are a rebellious house.
012:003 Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing,
        and remove by day in their sight; and you shall remove from
        your place to another place in their sight:  it may be they
        will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
012:004 You shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight,
        as stuff for removing; and you shall go forth yourself at
        even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.
012:005 Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
012:006 In their sight shall you bear it on your shoulder,
        and carry it forth in the dark; you shall cover your face,
        that you don't see the land:  for I have set you for a sign
        to the house of Israel.
012:007 I did so as I was commanded:  I brought forth my stuff by day,
        as stuff for removing, and in the even I dug through the wall
        with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it
        on my shoulder in their sight.
012:008 In the morning came the word of Yahweh to me, saying,
012:009 Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
        said to you, What do you?
012:010 Say you to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This burden
        [concerns] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel
        among whom they are.
012:011 Say, I am your sign:  like as I have done, so shall it be done
        to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
012:012 The prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder
        in the dark, and shall go forth:  they shall dig through
        the wall to carry out thereby:  he shall cover his face,
        because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
012:013 My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare;
        and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans;
        yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
012:014 I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about
        him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out
        the sword after them.
012:015 They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall disperse them
        among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
012:016 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword,
        from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare
        all their abominations among the nations where they come;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
012:017 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
012:018 Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water
        with trembling and with fearfulness;
012:019 and tell the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Yahweh
        concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land
        of Israel:  They shall eat their bread with fearfulness,
        and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate,
        [and despoiled] of all that is therein, because of the violence
        of all those who dwell therein.
012:020 The cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land
        shall be a desolation; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
012:021 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
012:022 Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land
        of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?
012:023 Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will
        make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it
        as a proverb in Israel; but tell them, The days are at hand,
        and the fulfillment of every vision.
012:024 For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering
        divination within the house of Israel.
012:025 For I am Yahweh; I will speak, and the word that I shall
        speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred:
        for in your days, rebellious house, will I speak the word,
        and will perform it, says the Lord Yahweh.
012:026 Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
012:027 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
        that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies
        of times that are far off.
012:028 Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  There shall
        none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I
        shall speak shall be performed, says the Lord Yahweh.
013:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
013:002 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy,
        and say you to those who prophesy out of their own heart,
        Hear you the word of Yahweh:
013:003 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Woe to the foolish prophets,
        who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
013:004 Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
013:005 You have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up
        the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle
        in the day of Yahweh.
013:006 They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say,
        Yahweh says; but Yahweh has not sent them:  and they have made
        men to hope that the word would be confirmed.
013:007 Haven't you seen a false vision, and haven't you spoken
        a lying divination, in that you say, Yahweh says; but I
        have not spoken?
013:008 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have spoken
        falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
013:009 My hand shall be against the prophets who see false visions,
        and who divine lies:  they shall not be in the council of my people,
        neither shall they be written in the writing of the house
        of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel;
        and you shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.
013:010 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace;
        and there is no peace; and when one builds up a wall, behold,
        they daub it with whitewash:
013:011 tell those who daub it with whitewash, that it shall fall:
        there shall be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones,
        shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear it.
013:012 Behold, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to you,
        Where is the daubing with which you have daubed it?
013:013 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will even tear it with
        a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing
        shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
013:014 So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash,
        and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation of it
        shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed
        in the midst of it:  and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
013:015 Thus will I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those
        who have daubed it with whitewash; and I will tell you,
        The wall is no more, neither those who daubed it;
013:016 [to wit], the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem,
        and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
013:017 You, son of man, set your face against the daughters
        of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart;
        and prophesy you against them,
013:018 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the women who sew
        pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head
        of [persons of] every stature to hunt souls!  Will you hunt
        the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
013:019 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley
        and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die,
        and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying
        to my people who listen to lies.
013:020 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am
        against your pillows, with which you there hunt the souls
        to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms;
        and I will let the souls go, even the souls who you hunt
        to make [them] fly.
013:021 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
        your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
013:022 Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous,
        whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of
        the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way,
        and be saved alive:
013:023 Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor
        practice divination.  I will deliver my people out of your hand;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
014:001 Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me.
014:002 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
014:003 Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart,
        and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face:
        should I be inquired of at all by them?
014:004 Therefore speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  Every man of the house of Israel who takes
        his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block
        of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet;
        I Yahweh will answer him therein according to the multitude
        of his idols;
014:005 that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
        because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
014:006 Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  Return you, and turn yourselves from your idols;
        and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
014:007 For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who
        sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes
        his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his
        iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire
        for himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself:
014:008 and I will set my face against that man, and will make him
        an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut
        him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
014:009 If the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Yahweh, have
        deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him,
        and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
014:010 They shall bear their iniquity:  the iniquity of the prophet
        shall be even as the iniquity of him who seeks [to him];
014:011 that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
        neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions;
        but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
014:012 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
014:013 Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass,
        and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of
        the bread of it, and send famine on it, and cut off from it
        man and animal;
014:014 though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
        they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
014:015 If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they
        ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass
        through because of the animals;
014:016 though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh,
        they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only
        should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.
014:017 Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through
        the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;
014:018 though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh,
        they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
        only should be delivered themselves.
014:019 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath
        on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal;
014:020 though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the
        Lord Yahweh, they should deliver neither son nor daughter;
        they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
014:021 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  How much more when I send my
        four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine,
        and the evil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it
        man and animal!
014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
        carried forth, both sons and daughters:  behold, they shall come
        forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings;
        and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I
        have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have
        brought on it.
014:023 They shall comfort you, when you see their way and their doings;
        and you shall know that I have not done without cause all
        that I have done in it, says the Lord Yahweh.
015:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
015:002 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree,
        the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
015:003 Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? or will men take
        a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
015:004 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has
        devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned:
        is it profitable for any work?
015:005 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work:
        how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned,
        shall it yet be meet for any work!
015:006 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As the vine tree among
        the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
        so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
015:007 I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire,
        but the fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I
        am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.
015:008 I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
        a trespass, says the Lord Yahweh.
016:001 Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
016:002 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;
016:003 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem:  Your birth
        and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite
        was your father, and your mother was a Hittite.
016:004 As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was
        not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you;
        you weren't salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
016:005 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have
        compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field,
        for that your person was abhorred, in the day that you were born.
016:006 When I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your blood,
        I said to you, [Though you are] in your blood, live; yes, I said
        to you, [Though you are] in your blood, live.
016:007 I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you
        increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent ornament;
        your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown;
        yet you were naked and bare.
016:008 Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time
        was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you,
        and covered your nakedness:  yes, I swore to you,
        and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord Yahweh,
        and you became mine.
016:009 Then washed I you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away
        your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
016:010 I clothed you also with embroidered work, and shod you
        with sealskin, and I girded you about with fine linen,
        and covered you with silk.
016:011 I decked you with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands,
        and a chain on your neck.
016:012 I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears,
        and a beautiful crown on your head.
016:013 Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your clothing
        was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work; you ate
        fine flour, and honey, and oil; and you were exceeding beautiful,
        and you prospered to royal estate.
016:014 Your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty;
        for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
016:015 But you did trust in your beauty, and played the prostitute
        because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution
        on everyone who passed by; his it was.
016:016 You took of your garments, and made for yourselves high places
        decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them:
        [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be [so].
016:017 You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver,
        which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men,
        and played the prostitute with them;
016:018 and you took your embroidered garments, and covered them,
        and did set my oil and my incense before them.
016:019 My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
        with which I fed you, you did even set it before them for a
        sweet savor; and [thus] it was, says the Lord Yahweh.
016:020 Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have
        borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured.
        Were your prostitution a small matter,
016:021 that you have slain my children, and delivered them up,
        in causing them to pass through [the fire] to them?
016:022 In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not
        remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare,
        and was weltering in your blood.
016:023 It is happen after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you! says
        the Lord Yahweh),
016:024 that you have built to you a vaulted place, and have made you
        a lofty place in every street.
016:025 You have built your lofty place at the head of every way,
        and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet
        to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.
016:026 You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians,
        your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied
        your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.
016:027 See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have
        diminished your ordinary [food], and delivered you to the will
        of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines,
        who are ashamed of your lewd way.
016:028 You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians,
        because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute
        with them, and yet you weren't satisfied.
016:029 You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land
        of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren't satisfied with this.
016:030 How weak is your heart, says the Lord Yahweh, seeing you
        do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;
016:031 in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way,
        and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been
        as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay.
016:032 A wife who commits adultery! who takes strangers instead
        of her husband!
016:033 They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts
        to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you
        on every side for your prostitution.
016:034 You are different from [other] women in your prostitution,
        in that none follows you to play the prostitute;
        and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you,
        therefore you are different.
016:035 Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh:
016:036 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Because your filthiness was poured out,
        and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with
        your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations,
        and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them;
016:037 therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you
        have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved,
        with all those who you have hated; I will even gather them
        against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness
        to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
016:038 I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood
        are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
016:039 I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw
        down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places;
        and they shall strip you of your clothes, and take your
        beautiful jewels; and they shall leave you naked and bare.
016:040 They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall
        stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.
016:041 They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments
        on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you
        to cease from playing the prostitute, and you shall also give
        no hire any more.
016:042 So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy
        shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be
        no more angry.
016:043 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth,
        but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold,
        I also will bring your way on your head, says the Lord Yahweh:
        and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.
016:044 Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use [this] proverb
        against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
016:045 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband
        and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters,
        who loathed their husbands and their children:
        your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
016:046 Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand,
        she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells
        at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
016:047 Yet have you not walked in their ways, nor done after
        their abominations; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing],
        you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
016:048 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, Sodom your sister has not done,
        she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.
016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom:
        pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her
        and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand
        of the poor and needy.
016:050 They were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
        therefore I took them away as I saw [good].
016:051 Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have
        multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified
        your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.
016:052 You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment
        for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed
        more abominable than they, they are more righteous that you:
        yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you
        have justified your sisters.
016:053 I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and
        her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,
        and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them;
016:054 that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because
        of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.
016:055 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
        former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return
        to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall
        return to your former estate.
016:056 For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day
        of your pride,
016:057 before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the
        reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round
        about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite
        to you round about.
016:058 You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says Yahweh.
016:059 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also deal with you as you
        have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days
        of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.
016:061 Then shall you remember your ways, and be ashamed,
        when you shall receive your sisters, your elder [sisters]
        and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters,
        but not by your covenant.
016:062 I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh;
016:063 that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your
        mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven
        you all that you have done, says the Lord Yahweh.
017:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
017:002 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the
        house of Israel;
017:003 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  A great eagle with great wings
        and long feathers, full of feathers, which had various colors,
        came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:
017:004 he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried
        it to a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.
017:005 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it
        in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters;
        he set it as a willow tree.
017:006 It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches
        turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him:
        so it became a vine, and brought forth branches,
        and shot forth sprigs.
017:007 There was also another great eagle with great wings
        and many feathers:  and behold, this vine did bend its
        roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him,
        from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
017:008 It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it
        might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit,
        that it might be a goodly vine.
017:009 Say you, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Shall it prosper? shall
        he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it,
        that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves
        may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it
        be raised from the roots of it.
017:010 Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
        utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither
        in the beds where it grew.
017:011 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
017:012 Say now to the rebellious house, Don't you know what these things
        mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem,
        and took the king of it, and the princes of it, and brought
        them to him to Babylon:
017:013 and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him;
        he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty
        of the land;
017:014 that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up,
        but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
017:015 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors
        into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people.
        Shall he prosper? shall he escape who does such things? shall
        he break the covenant, and yet escape?
017:016 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely in the place where
        the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised,
        and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst
        of Babylon he shall die.
017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
        help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts,
        to cut off many persons.
017:018 For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold,
        he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things;
        he shall not escape.
017:019 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As I live, surely my oath
        that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken,
        I will even bring it on his own head.
017:020 I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare,
        and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment
        with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
017:021 All his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword,
        and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind:
        and you shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
017:022 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also take of the lofty top
        of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost
        of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high
        and lofty mountain:
017:023 in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it
        shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar:
        and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade
        of the branches of it shall they dwell.
017:024 All the trees of the field shall know that I, Yahweh, have brought
        down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried
        up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish;
        I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.
018:001 The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,
018:002 What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land
        of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
        and the children's teeth are set on edge?
018:003 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, you shall not have [occasion]
        any more to use this proverb in Israel.
018:004 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father,
        so also the soul of the son is mine:  the soul who sins,
        he shall die.
018:005 But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,
018:006 and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has
        defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a woman
        in her impurity,
018:007 and has not wronged any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge,
        has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry,
        and has covered the naked with a garment;
018:008 he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken
        any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity,
        has executed true justice between man and man,
018:009 has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly;
        he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord Yahweh.
018:010 If he fathers a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood,
        and who does any one of these things,
018:011 and who does not any of those [duties], but even has eaten
        on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,
018:012 has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not
        restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols,
        has committed abomination,
018:013 has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; shall he then
        live? he shall not live:  he has done all these abominations;
        he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.
018:014 Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father's sins,
        which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;
018:015 who has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled
        his neighbor's wife,
018:016 neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge,
        neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread
        to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;
018:017 who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who has not received
        interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked
        in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father,
        he shall surely live.
018:018 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother,
        and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall
        die in his iniquity.
018:019 Yet say you, Why does not the son bear the iniquity
        of the father? when the son has done that which is lawful
        and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them,
        he shall surely live.
018:020 The soul who sins, he shall die:  the son shall not bear
        the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear
        the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous
        shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall
        be on him.
018:021 But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed,
        and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right,
        he shall surely live, he shall not die.
018:022 None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be
        remembered against him:  in his righteousness that he has
        done he shall live.
018:023 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Yahweh;
        and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?
018:024 But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness,
        and commits iniquity, and does according to all the
        abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live?
        None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered:
        in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin
        that he has sinned, in them shall he die.
018:025 Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.
        Hear now, house of Israel:  Is my way not equal?
        Aren't your ways unequal?
018:026 When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness,
        and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity
        that he has done shall he die.
018:027 Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness
        that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right,
        he shall save his soul alive.
018:028 Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions
        that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
018:029 Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal.
        house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
018:030 Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel,
        everyone according to his ways, says the Lord Yahweh.
        Return you, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions;
        so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
018:031 Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you
        have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit:
        for why will you die, house of Israel?
018:032 For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,
        says the Lord Yahweh:  therefore turn yourselves, and live.
019:001 Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
019:002 and say, What was your mother?  A lioness:  she couched among lions,
        in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs.
019:003 She brought up one of her cubs:  he became a young lion,
        and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
019:004 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit;
        and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
019:005 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost,
        then she took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion.
019:006 He went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion,
        and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
019:007 He knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land
        was desolate, and the fullness of it, because of the noise
        of his roaring.
019:008 Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces;
        and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
019:009 They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king
        of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice
        should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.
019:010 Your mother was like a vine, in your blood, planted by the waters:
        it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
019:011 It had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule,
        and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs,
        and they were seen in their height with the multitude
        of their branches.
019:012 But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground,
        and the east wind dried up its fruit:  its strong rods were
        broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.
019:013 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
019:014 Fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it has devoured
        its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter
        to rule.  This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
020:001 It happened in the seventh year, in the fifth [month],
        the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders
        of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh, and sat before me.
020:002 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
020:003 Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, Thus says
        the Lord Yahweh:  Is it to inquire of me that you have come?
        As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will not be inquired
        of by you.
020:004 Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them?
        Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
020:005 and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day when I
        chose Israel, and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob,
        and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I
        swore to them, saying, I am Yahweh your God;
020:006 in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land
        of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them,
        flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
020:007 I said to them, Cast you away every man the abominations
        of his eyes, and don't defile yourselves with the idols
        of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.
020:008 But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me;
        they did not every man cast away the abominations of
        their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt.
        Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish
        my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
020:009 But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be
        profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were,
        in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them
        forth out of the land of Egypt.
020:010 So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
        and brought them into the wilderness.
020:011 I gave them my statutes, and shown them my ordinances,
        which if a man do, he shall live in them.
020:012 Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign
        between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh
        who sanctifies them.
020:013 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
        they didn't walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances,
        which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my Sabbaths
        they greatly profaned.  Then I said I would pour out my wrath
        on them in the wilderness, to consume them.
020:014 But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned
        in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
020:015 Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I
        would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
        flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
020:016 because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in
        my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths:  for their heart went
        after their idols.
020:017 Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn't destroy them,
        neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
020:018 I said to their children in the wilderness, Don't you walk in
        the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances,
        nor defile yourselves with their idols.
020:019 I am Yahweh your God:  walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances,
        and do them;
020:020 and make my Sabbaths holy; and they shall be a sign between me
        and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
020:021 But the children rebelled against me; they didn't walk in
        my statutes, neither kept my ordinances to do them, which if
        a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my Sabbaths.
        Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish
        my anger against them in the wilderness.
020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake,
        that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations,
        in whose sight I brought them forth.
020:023 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter
        them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
020:024 because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected
        my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes
        were after their fathers' idols.
020:025 Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good,
        and ordinances in which they should not live;
020:026 and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused
        to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I
        might make them desolate, to the end that they might know
        that I am Yahweh.
020:027 Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel,
        and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In this moreover
        have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed
        a trespass against me.
020:028 For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore
        to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every
        thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices,
        and there they presented the provocation of their offering;
        there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out
        there their drink offerings.
020:029 Then I said to them, What means the high place whereunto you go?
        So the name of it is called Bamah to this day.
020:030 Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Do you
        pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play
        you the prostitute after their abominations?
020:031 and when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons
        to pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all
        your idols to this day? and shall I be inquired of by you,
        house of Israel?  As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will
        not be inquired of by you;
020:032 and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all,
        in that you say, We will be as the nations, as the families
        of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
020:033 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out,
        will I be king over you:
020:034 and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out
        of the countries in which you are scattered, with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;
020:035 and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples,
        and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.
020:036 Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness
        of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
020:037 I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
        into the bond of the covenant;
020:038 and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who
        disobey against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where
        they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel:
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
020:039 As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Go you,
        serve everyone his idols, and hereafter also, if you will
        not listen to me; but my holy name shall you no more profane
        with your gifts, and with your idols.
020:040 For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
        says the Lord Yahweh, there shall all the house of Israel,
        all of them, serve me in the land:  there will I accept them,
        and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits
        of your offerings, with all your holy things.
020:041 As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from
        the peoples, and gather you out of the countries in which you
        have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight
        of the nations.
020:042 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall bring you into
        the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give
        to your fathers.
020:043 There shall you remember your ways, and all your doings,
        in which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall
        loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils
        that you have committed.
020:044 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you
        for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways,
        nor according to your corrupt doings, you house of Israel,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
020:045 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
020:046 Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop [your
        word] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest
        of the field in the South;
020:047 and tell the forest of the South, Hear the word of Yahweh:  Thus says
        the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it
        shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree:
        the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from
        the south to the north shall be burnt thereby.
020:048 All flesh shall see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it;
        it shall not be quenched.
020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! they say of me, Isn't he a
        speaker of parables?
021:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
021:002 Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop [your word]
        toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
021:003 and tell the land of Israel, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I am
        against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath,
        and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
021:004 Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and
        the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath
        against all flesh from the south to the north:
021:005 and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, have drawn forth
        my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
021:006 Sigh therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your thighs
        and with bitterness shall you sigh before their eyes.
021:007 It shall be, when they tell you, Why do you sigh? that you shall say,
        Because of the news, for it comes; and every heart shall melt,
        and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint,
        and all knees shall be weak as water:  behold, it comes,
        and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.
021:008 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
021:009 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh:  Say, A sword,
        a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;
021:010 it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished
        that it may be as lightning:  shall we then make mirth?
        the rod of my son, it condemns every tree.
021:011 It is given to be furbished, that it may be handled:
        the sword, it is sharpened, yes, it is furbished, to give it
        into the hand of the killer.
021:012 Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people, it is on all
        the princes of Israel:  they are delivered over to the sword
        with my people; strike therefore on your thigh.
021:013 For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that condemns
        shall be no more? says the Lord Yahweh.
021:014 You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together;
        and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword
        of the deadly wounded:  it is the sword of the great one
        who is deadly wounded, which enters into their chambers.
021:015 I have set the threatening sword against all their gates,
        that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied:
        ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
021:016 Gather you together, go to the right, set yourself in array,
        go to the left, wherever your face is set.
021:017 I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath
        to rest:  I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
021:018 The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,
021:019 Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king
        of Babylon may come; they both shall come forth out of one land:
        and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way
        to the city.
021:020 You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of
        the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
021:021 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way,
        at the head of the two ways, to use divination:
        he shook the arrows back and forth, he consulted the teraphim,
        he looked in the liver.
021:022 In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem,
        to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter,
        to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams
        against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
021:023 It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight,
        who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory,
        that they may be taken.
021:024 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have made
        your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions
        are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
        because you have come to memory, you shall be taken with the hand.
021:025 You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel,
        whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
021:026 thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Remove the turban, and take off the crown;
        this [shall be] no more the same; exalt that which is low,
        and abase that which is high.
021:027 I will overturn, overturn, overturn it:  this also shall be no more,
        until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him].
021:028 You, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh
        concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach;
        and say you, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it
        is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;
021:029 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you,
        to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded,
        whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
021:030 Cause it to return into its sheath.  In the place where you
        were created, in the land of your birth, will I judge you.
021:031 I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you
        with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand
        of brutish men, skillful to destroy.
021:032 You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in
        the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered:
        for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
022:001 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
022:002 You, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody
        city? then cause her to know all her abominations.
022:003 You shall say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  A city that
        sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come,
        and that makes idols against herself to defile her!
022:004 You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed,
        and are defiled in your idols which you have made; and you have
        caused your days to draw near, and are come even to your years:
        therefore have I made you a reproach to the nations,
        and a mocking to all the countries.
022:005 Those who are near, and those who are far from you, shall mock you,
        you infamous one [and] full of tumult.
022:006 Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power,
        have been in you to shed blood.
022:007 In you have they set light by father and mother; in the midst
        of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner;
        in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
022:008 You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
022:009 Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood; and in you
        they have eaten on the mountains:  in the midst of you they
        have committed lewdness.
022:010 In you have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you
        have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.
022:011 One has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife;
        and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another
        in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
022:012 In you have they taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken
        interest and increase, and you have greedily gained
        of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
022:013 Behold, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest
        gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been
        in the midst of you.
022:014 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days
        that I shall deal with you?  I, Yahweh, have spoken it,
        and will do it.
022:015 I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through
        the countries; and I will consume your filthiness out of you.
022:016 You shall be profaned in yourself, in the sight of the nations;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
022:017 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
022:018 Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me:
        all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst
        of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
022:019 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are all
        become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into
        the midst of Jerusalem.
022:020 As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
        into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire on it,
        to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my wrath,
        and I will lay you there, and melt you.
022:021 Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath,
        and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
022:022 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall
        you be melted in the midst of it; and you shall know
        that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you.
022:023 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
022:024 Son of man, tell her, You are a land that is not cleansed,
        nor rained on in the day of indignation.
022:025 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of it,
        like a roaring lion ravening the prey:  they have devoured souls;
        they take treasure and precious things; they have made her
        widows many in the midst of it.
022:026 Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned
        my holy things:  they have made no distinction between the holy
        and the common, neither have they caused men to discern
        between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes
        from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
022:027 Her princes in the midst of it are like wolves ravening
        the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, that they
        may get dishonest gain.
022:028 Her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing
        false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says
        the Lord Yahweh, when Yahweh has not spoken.
022:029 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery;
        yes, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed
        the foreigner wrongfully.
022:030 I sought for a man among them, who should build up the wall,
        and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should
        not destroy it; but I found none.
022:031 Therefore have I poured out my indignation on them;
        I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath:  their own
        way have I brought on their heads, says the Lord Yahweh.
023:001 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
023:002 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
023:003 and they played the prostitute in Egypt; they played the
        prostitute in their youth; there were their breasts pressed,
        and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.
023:004 The names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister:
        and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters.
        As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
023:005 Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted
        on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,
023:006 who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them
        desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
023:007 She bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria
        all of them; and on whoever she doted, with all their idols
        she defiled herself.
023:008 Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt;
        for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom
        of her virginity; and they poured out their prostitution on her.
023:009 Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
        into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.
023:010 These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters;
        and her they killed with the sword:  and she became a byword
        among women; for they executed judgments on her.
023:011 Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her
        doting than she, and in her prostitution which were more than
        the prostitution of her sister.
023:012 She doted on the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors,
        clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them
        desirable young men.
023:013 I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.
023:014 She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on
        the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
023:015 girded with girdles on their waists, with flowing turbans on
        their heads, all of them princes to look on, after the likeness
        of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
023:016 As soon as she saw them she doted on them, and sent messengers
        to them into Chaldea.
023:017 The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled
        her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them,
        and her soul was alienated from them.
023:018 So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness:
        then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was
        alienated from her sister.
023:019 Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days
        of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in
        the land of Egypt.
023:020 She doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
        of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
023:021 Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth,
        in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts
        of your youth.
023:022 Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will raise
        up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated,
        and I will bring them against you on every side:
023:023 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa,
        [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men,
        governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown,
        all of them riding on horses.
023:024 They shall come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons,
        and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves
        against you with buckler and shield and helmet round about;
        and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge
        you according to their judgments.
023:025 I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with
        you in fury; they shall take away your nose and your ears;
        and your residue shall fall by the sword:  they shall take
        your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured
        by the fire.
023:026 They shall also strip you of your clothes, and take away
        your beautiful jewels.
023:027 Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you,
        and your prostitution [brought] from the land of Egypt;
        so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember
        Egypt any more.
023:028 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will deliver you
        into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them
        from whom your soul is alienated;
023:029 and they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take
        away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare;
        and the nakedness of your prostitution shall be uncovered,
        both your lewdness and your prostitution.
023:030 These things shall be done to you, because you have played
        the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted
        with their idols.
023:031 You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I
        give her cup into your hand.
023:032 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You will drink of your sister's cup,
        which is deep and large; you will be ridiculed and held in derision;
        it contains much.
023:033 You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of
        astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.
023:034 You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall
        gnaw the broken pieces of it, and shall tear your breasts;
        for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh.
023:035 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have forgotten me,
        and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your
        lewdness and your prostitution.
023:036 Yahweh said moreover to me:  Son of man, will you judge Oholah
        and Oholibah? then declare to them their abominations.
023:037 For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands;
        and with their idols have they committed adultery;
        and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me,
        to pass through [the fire] to them to be devoured.
023:038 Moreover this they have done to me:  they have defiled my
        sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
023:039 For when they had slain their children to their idols,
        then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;
        and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
023:040 Furthermore you have sent for men who come from far,
        to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came;
        for whom you did wash yourself, paint your eyes, and deck
        yourself with ornaments,
023:041 and sit on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it,
        whereupon you did set my incense and my oil.
023:042 The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her:
        and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards
        from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands
        of them [twain], and beautiful crowns on their heads.
023:043 Then said I of her who was old in adulteries, Now will they
        play the prostitute with her, and she [with them].
023:044 They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute:
        so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
023:045 Righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment
        of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood;
        because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
023:046 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will bring up a company
        against them, and will give them to be tossed back and
        forth and robbed.
023:047 The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with
        their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters,
        and burn up their houses with fire.
023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
        women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
023:049 They shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall
        bear the sins of your idols; and you shall know that I am
        the Lord Yahweh.
024:001 Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth
        [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
024:002 Son of man, write you the name of the day, [even] of this same day:
        the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.
024:003 Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them,
        Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Set on the caldron, set it on,
        and also pour water into it:
024:004 gather the pieces of it into it, even every good piece,
        the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
024:005 Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood]
        for the bones under [the caldron]; make it boil well;
        yes, let the bones of it be boiled in the midst of it.
024:006 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the bloody city,
        to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust
        is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece;
        No lot is fallen on it.
024:007 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock;
        she didn't pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.
024:008 That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set
        her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
024:009 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the bloody city!
        I also will make the pile great.
024:010 Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh,
        and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.
024:011 Then set it empty on the coals of it, that it may be hot,
        and the brass of it may burn, and that the filthiness of it
        may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.
024:012 She has wearied [herself] with toil; yet her great rust doesn't
        go forth out of her; her rust doesn't [go forth] by fire.
024:013 In your filthiness is lewdness:  because I have cleansed you
        and you weren't cleansed, you shall not be cleansed from your
        filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward
        you to rest.
024:014 I, Yahweh, have spoken it:  it shall happen, and I will do it:
        I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent;
        according to your ways, and according to your doings,
        shall they judge you, says the Lord Yahweh.
024:015 Also the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
024:016 Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your
        eyes with a stroke:  yet you shall neither mourn nor weep,
        neither shall your tears run down.
024:017 Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead;
        bind your headdress on you, and put your shoes on your feet,
        and don't cover your lips, and don't eat men's bread.
024:018 So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at even my wife died;
        and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
024:019 The people said to me, Won't you tell us what these things
        are to us, that you do so?
024:020 Then I said to them, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
024:021 Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I
        will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power,
        the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities;
        and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind
        shall fall by the sword.
024:022 You shall do as I have done:  you shall not cover your lips,
        nor eat the bread of men.
024:023 Your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet:
        you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away
        in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
024:024 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has
        done shall you do:  when this comes, then shall you know
        that I am the Lord Yahweh.
024:025 You, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
        from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
        of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart,
        their sons and their daughters,
024:026 that in that day he who escapes shall come to you, to cause
        you to hear it with your ears?
024:027 In that day shall your mouth be opened to him who is escaped,
        and you shall speak, and be no more mute:  so shall you
        be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
025:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
025:002 Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon,
        and prophesy against them:
025:003 and tell the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the
        Lord Yahweh:  Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Because you
        said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned;
        and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate;
        and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:
025:004 therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east
        for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in you,
        and make their dwellings in you; they shall eat your fruit,
        and they shall drink your milk.
025:005 I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children
        of Ammon a resting place for flocks:  and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
025:006 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have clapped your hands,
        and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite
        of your soul against the land of Israel;
025:007 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you,
        and will deliver you for a spoil to the nations;
        and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause
        you to perish out of the countries:  I will destroy you;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
025:008 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because Moab and Seir say, Behold,
        the house of Judah is like all the nations;
025:009 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities,
        from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory
        of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim,
025:010 to the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon;
        and I will give them for a possession, that the children
        of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
025:011 and I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
025:012 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because Edom has dealt against
        the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended,
        and revenged himself on them;
025:013 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, I will stretch out my
        hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it;
        and I will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan shall
        they fall by the sword.
025:014 I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel;
        and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and
        according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
025:015 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because the Philistines have dealt
        by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul
        to destroy with perpetual enmity;
025:016 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will stretch out
        my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites,
        and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
025:017 I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall lay my
        vengeance on them.
026:001 It happened in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month,
        that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
026:002 Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha,
        she is broken:  the gate of the peoples; she is turned to me;
        I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:
026:003 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I am against you,
        Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you,
        as the sea causes its waves to come up.
026:004 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers:
        I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
026:005 She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst
        of the sea; for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh;
        and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
026:006 Her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword:
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
026:007 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will bring
        on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings,
        from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen,
        and a company, and much people.
026:008 He shall kill with the sword your daughters in the field;
        and he shall make forts against you, and cast up a mound
        against you, and raise up the buckler against you.
026:009 He shall set his battering engines against your walls,
        and with his axes he shall break down your towers.
026:010 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you:
        your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen,
        and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter
        into your gates, as men enter into a city in which is
        made a breach.
026:011 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets;
        he shall kill your people with the sword; and the pillars
        of your strength shall go down to the ground.
026:012 They shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey
        of your merchandise; and they shall break down your walls,
        and destroy your pleasant houses; and they shall lay your stones
        and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters.
026:013 I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound
        of your harps shall be no more heard.
026:014 I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place
        for the spreading of nets; you shall be built no more:
        for I Yahweh have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh.
026:015 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre:  shall not the islands
        shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan,
        when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?
026:016 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,
        and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments:
        they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall
        sit on the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be
        astonished at you.
026:017 They shall take up a lamentation over you, and tell you,
        How are you destroyed, who were inhabited by seafaring men,
        the renowned city, who was strong in the sea, she and
        her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all
        who lived there!
026:018 Now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall;
        yes, the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed
        at your departure.
026:019 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When I shall make you
        a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited;
        when I shall bring up the deep on you, and the great waters
        shall cover you;
026:020 then will I bring you down with those who descend into the pit,
        to the people of old time, and will make you to dwell in the lower
        parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old,
        with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited;
        and I will set glory in the land of the living:
026:021 I will make you a terror, and you shall no more have any being;
        though you are sought for, yet shall you never be found again,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
027:001 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
027:002 You, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
027:003 and tell Tyre, you who dwell at the entry of the sea,
        who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands,
        thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You, Tyre, have said, I am
        perfect in beauty.
027:004 Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders
        have perfected your beauty.
027:005 They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir;
        they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars;
        they have made your benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood,
        from the islands of Kittim.
027:007 Of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail,
        that it might be to you for a banner; blue and purple from
        the islands of Elishah was your awning.
027:008 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers:
        your wise men, Tyre, were in you, they were your pilots.
027:009 The old men of Gebal and the wise men of it were in you your
        repairers of ship seams:  all the ships of the sea with their
        mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise.
027:010 Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war:
        they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set
        forth your comeliness.
027:011 The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about,
        and valorous men were in your towers; they hanged their shields
        on your walls round about; they have perfected your beauty.
027:012 Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude
        of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead,
        they traded for your wares.
027:013 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traffickers;
        they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass
        for your merchandise.
027:014 They of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses
        and war horses and mules.
027:015 The men of Dedan were your traffickers; many islands were
        the market of your hand:  they brought you in exchange horns
        of ivory and ebony.
027:016 Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of
        your handiworks:  they traded for your wares with emeralds, purple,
        and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.
027:017 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your traffickers:
        they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, and confections,
        and honey, and oil, and balm.
027:018 Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks,
        by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine
        of Helbon, and white wool.
027:019 Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for your wares:
        bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among your merchandise.
027:020 Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding.
027:021 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants
        of your hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were
        they your merchants.
027:022 The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traffickers;
        they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices,
        and with all precious stones, and gold.
027:023 Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur
        [and] Chilmad, were your traffickers.
027:024 These were your traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings
        of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich clothing,
        bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise.
027:025 The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise:
        and you were replenished, and made very glorious in the heart
        of the seas.
027:026 Your rowers have brought you into great waters:
        the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas.
027:027 Your riches, and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners,
        and your pilots, your repairers of ship seams, and the dealers
        in your merchandise, and all your men of war, who are in you,
        with all your company which is in the midst of you, shall fall
        into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.
027:028 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs shall shake.
027:029 All who handled the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots
        of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall
        stand on the land,
027:030 and shall cause their voice to be heard over you, and shall
        cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust on their heads,
        they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
027:031 and they shall make themselves bald for you, and gird them
        with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you in bitterness
        of soul with bitter mourning.
027:032 In their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you,
        and lament over you, [saying], Who is there like Tyre,
        like her who is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
027:033 When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many peoples;
        you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude
        of your riches and of your merchandise.
027:034 In the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths
        of the waters, your merchandise and all your company did fall
        in the midst of you.
027:035 All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you,
        and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled
        in their face.
027:036 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you are become
        a terror, and you shall nevermore have any being.
028:001 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
028:002 Son of man, tell the prince of Tyre, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said,
        I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
        yet you are man, and not God, though you did set your heart
        as the heart of God--
028:003 behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is
        hidden from you;
028:004 by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten you riches,
        and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures;
028:005 by your great wisdom [and] by your traffic have you increased
        your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches--
028:006 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have set
        your heart as the heart of God,
028:007 therefore, behold, I will bring strangers on you, the terrible
        of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty
        of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness.
028:008 They shall bring you down to the pit; and you shall die the death
        of those who are slain, in the heart of the seas.
028:009 Will you yet say before him who kills you, I am God? but you
        are man, and not God, in the hand of him who wounds you.
028:010 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand
        of strangers:  for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh.
028:011 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
028:012 Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre,
        and tell him, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You seal up the sum,
        full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
028:013 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone
        adorned you:  ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx,
        jasper, sapphire{or, lapis lazuli}, turquoise, and beryl.
        Gold work of tambourines and of pipes was in you.
        In the day that you were created they were prepared.
028:014 You were the anointed cherub who covers:  and I set you,
        [so that] you were on the holy mountain of God; you have walked
        up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
028:015 You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created,
        until unrighteousness was found in you.
028:016 By the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you
        with violence, and you have sinned:  therefore I have cast you
        as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed you,
        covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
028:017 Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you have
        corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness:
        I have cast you to the ground; I have laid you before kings,
        that they may see you.
028:018 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness
        of your traffic, you have profaned your sanctuaries;
        therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of you;
        it has devoured you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth
        in the sight of all those who see you.
028:019 All those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you:
        you are become a terror, and you shall nevermore have any being.
028:020 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
028:021 Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
028:022 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against
        you, Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of you;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall have executed
        judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
028:023 For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets;
        and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword
        on her on every side; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
028:024 There shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel,
        nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them,
        that did despite to them; and they shall know that I am
        the Lord Yahweh.
028:025 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When I shall have gathered the house
        of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered,
        and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations,
        then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to
        my servant Jacob.
028:026 They shall dwell securely therein; yes, they shall build houses,
        and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed
        judgments on all those who do them despite round about them;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh their God.
029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day
        of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
029:002 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
029:003 Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I am
        against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies
        in the midst of his rivers, that has said, 'My river is my own,
        and I have made it for myself.'
029:004 I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish
        of your rivers stick to your scales; and I will bring you up
        out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your
        rivers which stick to your scales.
029:005 I'll cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all
        the fish of your rivers.  You'll fall on the open field.
        You won't be brought together, nor gathered.  I have given
        you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds
        of the sky.
029:006 All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,
        because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
029:007 When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore
        all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke,
        and paralyzed all of their thighs."
029:008 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I will bring
        a sword on you, and will cut off from you man and animal.
029:009 The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh.  Because he has said,
        'The river is mine, and I have made it;'
029:010 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers,
        and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation,
        from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall
        pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
029:012 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst
        of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among
        the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years;
        and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
        disperse them through the countries."
029:013 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "At the end of forty years will I
        gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;
029:014 and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them
        to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth;
        and they shall be there a base kingdom.
029:015 It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more
        lift itself up above the nations:  and I will diminish them,
        that they shall no more rule over the nations.
029:016 It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
        bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them:
        and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh."'"
029:017 It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month],
        in the first [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came
        to me, saying,
029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
        serve a great service against Tyre:  every head was made bald,
        and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army,
        from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
029:019 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will give
        the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
        and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil,
        and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which
        he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord Yahweh.
029:021 In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel,
        and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
030:001 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
030:002 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Wail, Alas
        for the day!
030:003 For the day is near, even the day of Yahweh is near;
        it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
030:004 A sword shall come on Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia,
        when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away
        her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
030:005 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub,
        and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall
        with them by the sword.
030:006 Thus says Yahweh:  They also who uphold Egypt shall fall;
        and the pride of her power shall come down:
        from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
030:007 They shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that
        are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities
        that are wasted.
030:008 They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt,
        and all her helpers are destroyed.
030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships
        to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be
        anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes.
030:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also make the multitude of
        Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations,
        shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw
        their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
030:012 I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into
        the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate,
        and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers:
        I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
030:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also destroy the idols,
        and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis;
        and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt:
        and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
030:014 I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan,
        and will execute judgments on No.
030:015 I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt;
        and I will cut off the multitude of No.
030:016 I will set a fire in Egypt:  Sin shall be in great anguish,
        and No shall be broken up; and Memphis [shall have] adversaries
        in the daytime.
030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword;
        and these [cities] shall go into captivity.
030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall
        break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power
        shall cease in her:  as for her, a cloud shall cover her,
        and her daughters shall go into captivity.
030:019 Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt; and they shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
030:020 It happened in the eleventh year, in the first [month],
        in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh
        came to me, saying,
030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
        and behold, it has not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines,
        to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
030:022 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against Pharaoh
        king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm],
        and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall
        out of his hand.
030:023 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
        them through the countries.
030:024 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
        my sword in his hand:  but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,
        and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a
        deadly wounded man.
030:025 I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms
        of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Yahweh,
        when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,
        and he shall stretch it out on the land of Egypt.
030:026 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them
        through the countries; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
031:001 It happened in the eleventh year, in the third [month],
        in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came
        to me, saying,
031:002 Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:
        Whom are you like in your greatness?
031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful
        branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature;
        and its top was among the thick boughs.
031:004 The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow:
        the rivers of it ran round about its plantation; and it sent
        out its channels to all the trees of the field.
031:005 Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;
        and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long
        by reason of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.
031:006 All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs;
        and under its branches did all the animals of the field bring
        forth their young; and under its shadow lived all great nations.
031:007 Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches;
        for its root was by many waters.
031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir
        trees were not like its boughs, and the plane trees were
        not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God
        like it in its beauty.
031:009 I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,
        so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden
        of God, envied it.
031:010 Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are exalted
        in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs,
        and his heart is lifted up in his height;
031:011 I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of
        the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven
        him out for his wickedness.
031:012 Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
        and have left him:  on the mountains and in all the valleys
        his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all
        the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth
        are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
031:013 On his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell, and all
        the animals of the field shall be on his branches;
031:014 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
        in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs,
        nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height,
        [even] all who drink water:  for they are all delivered to death,
        to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children
        of men, with those who go down to the pit.
031:015 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day when he went down to
        Sheol I caused a mourning:  I covered the deep for him, and I
        restrained the rivers of it; and the great waters were stayed;
        and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees
        of the field fainted for him.
031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
        cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit;
        and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon,
        all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts
        of the earth.
031:017 They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain
        by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, [that] lived
        under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
031:018 To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees
        of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden
        to the lower parts of the earth:  you shall lie in the midst
        of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.
        This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh.
032:001 It happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
        in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came
        to me, saying,
032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        and tell him, You were likened to a young lion of the nations:
        yet are you as a monster in the seas; and you did break forth
        with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet,
        and fouled their rivers.
032:003 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will spread out my net on you
        with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring you up
        in my net.
032:004 I will leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field,
        and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you,
        and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.
032:005 I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys
        with your height.
032:006 I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim,
        even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of you.
032:007 When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make
        the stars of it dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud,
        and the moon shall not give its light.
032:008 All the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you,
        and set darkness on your land, says the Lord Yahweh.
032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall
        bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries
        which you have not known.
032:010 Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings
        shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my
        sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment,
        every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.
032:011 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The sword of the king of Babylon
        shall come on you.
032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall;
        the terrible of the nations are they all:  and they shall
        bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude
        of it shall be destroyed.
032:013 I will destroy also all the animals of it from beside many waters;
        neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more,
        nor the hoofs of animals trouble them.
032:014 Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers
        to run like oil, says the Lord Yahweh.
032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,
        a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall
        strike all those who dwell therein, then shall they know
        that I am Yahweh.
032:016 This is the lamentation with which they shall lament;
        the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt,
        and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
032:017 It happened also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day]
        of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down,
        even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower
        parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.
032:019 Whom do you pass in beauty?  Go down, and be laid
        with the uncircumcised.
032:020 They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword:
        she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.
032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
        of Sheol with those who help him:  they are gone down,
        they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
032:022 Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her;
        all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
032:023 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit,
        and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain,
        fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave;
        all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down
        uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused
        their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their
        shame with those who go down to the pit.
032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain
        with all her multitude; her graves are round about her;
        all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their
        terror was caused in the land of the living, and they
        have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit:
        he is put in the midst of those who are slain.
032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are
        round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword;
        for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
032:027 They shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of
        the uncircumcised, who are gone down to Sheol with their
        weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads,
        and their iniquities are on their bones; for [they were]
        the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
032:028 But you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
        and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword.
032:029 There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their
        might are laid with those who are slain by the sword:
        they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go
        down to the pit.
032:030 There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all
        the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror
        which they caused by their might they are put to shame;
        and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword,
        and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all
        his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
032:032 For I have put his terror in the land of the living;
        and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised,
        with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all
        his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh.
033:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them,
        When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land
        take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
033:003 if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet,
        and warn the people;
033:004 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn't
        take warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
        shall be on his own head.
033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn't take warning;
        his blood shall be on him; whereas if he had taken warning,
        he would have delivered his soul.
033:006 But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn't blow the trumpet,
        and the people aren't warned, and the sword comes, and take
        any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity,
        but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
033:007 So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house
        of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
        warning from me.
033:008 When I tell the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die,
        and you don't speak to warn the wicked from his way;
        that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood
        will I require at your hand.
033:009 Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it,
        and he doesn't turn from his way; he shall die in his iniquity,
        but you have delivered your soul.
033:010 You, son of man, tell the house of Israel:  Thus you speak,
        saying, Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we
        pine away in them; how then can we live?
033:011 Tell them, As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I have no pleasure
        in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
        his way and live:  turn you, turn you from your evil ways;
        for why will you die, house of Israel?
033:012 You, son of man, tell the children of your people,
        The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day
        of his disobedience; and as for the wickedness of the wicked,
        he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from
        his wickedness; neither shall he who is righteous be able
        to live thereby in the day that he sins.
033:013 When I tell the righteous, that he shall surely live;
        if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity,
        none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his
        iniquity that he has committed, therein shall he die.
033:014 Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die;
        if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
033:015 if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken
        by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity;
        he shall surely live, he shall not die.
033:016 None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered
        against him:  he has done that which is lawful and right;
        he shall surely live.
033:017 Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord
        is not equal:  but as for them, their way is not equal.
033:018 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity,
        he shall even die therein.
033:019 When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which
        is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
033:020 Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.
        House of Israel, I will judge you everyone after his ways.
033:021 It happened in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
        tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one
        who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city
        has been struck.
033:022 Now the hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening,
        before he who was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth,
        until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened,
        and I was no more mute.
033:023 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
033:024 Son of man, they who inhabit those waste places in the land of
        Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land:
        but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
033:025 Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You eat with
        the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood:
        and shall you possess the land?
033:026 You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and you defile
        everyone his neighbor's wife:  and shall you possess the land?
033:027 Thus shall you tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As I live,
        surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword;
        and him who is in the open field will I give to the animals
        to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in
        the caves shall die of the pestilence.
033:028 I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment;
        and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains
        of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
033:029 Then shall they know that I am Yahweh, when I have made
        the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all
        their abominations which they have committed.
033:030 As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk
        of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak
        one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Please come
        and hear what is the word that comes forth from Yahweh.
033:031 They come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you
        as my people, and they hear your words, but don't do them;
        for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart
        goes after their gain.
033:032 Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has
        a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument;
        for they hear your words, but they don't do them.
033:033 When this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then shall they
        know that a prophet has been among them.
034:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
        prophesy, and tell them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves!
        Shouldn't the shepherds feed the sheep?
034:003 You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill
        the fatlings; but you don't feed the sheep.
034:004 You haven't strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed
        that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which
        was broken, neither have you brought back that which was
        driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost;
        but with force and with rigor have you ruled over them.
034:005 They were scattered, because there was no shepherd;
        and they became food to all the animals of the field,
        and were scattered.
034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill:
        yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth;
        and there was none who searched or sought.
034:007 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
034:008 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely because my sheep became
        a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field,
        because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds
        search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves,
        and didn't feed my sheep;
034:009 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
034:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against the shepherds;
        and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them
        to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds
        feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from
        their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
034:011 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I myself, even I,
        will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
034:012 As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among
        his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep;
        and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been
        scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
034:013 I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from
        the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I
        will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses,
        and in all the inhabited places of the country.
034:014 I will feed them with good pasture; and on the mountains
        of the height of Israel shall their fold be:  there shall
        they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they
        feed on the mountains of Israel.
034:015 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause
        them to lie down, says the Lord Yahweh.
034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back
        that which was driven away, and will bind up that which
        was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick:
        but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed
        them in justice.
034:017 As for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I judge
        between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.
034:018 Seems it a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture,
        but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your
        pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must
        foul the residue with your feet?
034:019 As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet,
        and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.
034:020 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them:  Behold, I, even I,
        will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
034:021 Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all
        the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad;
034:022 therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey;
        and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
034:023 I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,
        even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
        be their shepherd.
034:024 I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince
        among them; I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
034:025 I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
        evil animals to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell
        securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
034:026 I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
        and I will cause the shower to come down in its season;
        there shall be showers of blessing.
034:027 The tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall
        yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken
        the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand
        of those who made slaves of them.
034:028 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall
        the animals of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely,
        and none shall make them afraid.
034:029 I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall
        be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear
        the shame of the nations any more.
034:030 They shall know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them,
        and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
034:031 You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
035:001 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
035:002 Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
035:003 and tell it, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,
        Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you,
        and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment.
035:004 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
035:005 Because you have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over
        the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time
        of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
035:006 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will prepare
        you to blood, and blood shall pursue you:  since you have
        not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.
035:007 Thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation;
        and I will cut off from it him who passes through and
        him who returns.
035:008 I will fill its mountains with its slain:  in your hills
        and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they
        fall who are slain with the sword.
035:009 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall
        not be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
035:010 Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries
        shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Yahweh was there:
035:011 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will do according
        to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown
        out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known
        among them, when I shall judge you.
035:012 You shall know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults
        which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying,
        They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
035:013 You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth,
        and have multiplied your words against me:  I have heard it.
035:014 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When the whole earth rejoices,
        I will make you desolate.
035:015 As you did rejoice over the inheritance of the house
        of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you:
        you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it;
        and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
036:001 You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say,
        You mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh.
036:002 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because the enemy has said against you,
        Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;
036:003 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because, even
        because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up
        on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue
        of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers,
        and the evil report of the people;
036:004 therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
        Lord Yahweh:  Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains
        and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys,
        to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken,
        which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations
        that are round about;
036:005 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Surely in the fire of my
        jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations,
        and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves
        for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite
        of soul, to cast it out for a prey.
036:006 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell
        the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to
        the valleys, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I have spoken
        in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne
        the shame of the nations:
036:007 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I have sworn, [saying],
        Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall
        bear their shame.
036:008 But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches,
        and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at
        hand to come.
036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and you
        shall be tilled and sown;
036:010 and I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel,
        even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste
        places shall be built;
036:011 and I will multiply on you man and animal; and they shall increase
        and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your
        former estate, and will do better [to you] than at your beginnings:
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
036:012 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel;
        and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance,
        and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of children.
036:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because they say to you,
        You [land] are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver
        of your nation;
036:014 therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your
        nation any more, says the Lord Yahweh;
036:015 neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations,
        neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more,
        neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
036:016 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land,
        they defiled it by their way and by their doings:
        their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman
        in her impurity.
036:018 Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they
        had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it
        with their idols;
036:019 and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed
        through the countries:  according to their way and according
        to their doings I judged them.
036:020 When they came to the nations, where they went, they profaned
        my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people
        of Yahweh, and are gone forth out of his land.
036:021 But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel
        had profaned among the nations, where they went.
036:022 Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  I don't do [this] for your sake, house of Israel,
        but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations,
        where you went.
036:023 I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among
        the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of them;
        and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, says the Lord Yahweh,
        when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
036:024 For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out
        of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
036:025 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean:
        from all your filthiness, and from all your idols,
        will I cleanse you.
036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
        within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
        and I will give you a heart of flesh.
036:027 I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
        my statutes, and you shall keep my ordinances, and do them.
036:028 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
        and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
036:029 I will save you from all your uncleanness:  and I will call
        for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.
036:030 I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase
        of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach
        of famine among the nations.
036:031 Then shall you remember your evil ways, and your doings that
        were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own
        sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
036:032 Nor for your sake do I [this], says the Lord Yahweh, be it
        known to you:  be ashamed and confounded for your ways,
        house of Israel.
036:033 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day that I cleanse you from
        all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited,
        and the waste places shall be built.
036:034 The land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was
        a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.
036:035 They shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
        the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
        cities are fortified and inhabited.
036:036 Then the nations that are left round about you shall know
        that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted
        that which was desolate:  I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I
        will do it.
036:037 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  For this, moreover, will I
        be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them:
        I will increase them with men like a flock.
036:038 As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her
        appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with
        flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
037:001 The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit
        of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley;
        and it was full of bones.
037:002 He caused me to pass by them round about:  and behold,
        there were very many in the open valley; and behold,
        they were very dry.
037:003 He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live?  I answered,
        Lord Yahweh, you know.
037:004 Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them,
        you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.
037:005 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones:  Behold, I will cause
        breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
037:006 I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you,
        and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded:  and as I prophesied,
        there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones
        came together, bone to its bone.
037:008 I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up,
        and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
037:009 Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man,
        and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Come from
        the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain,
        that they may live.
037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came
        into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet,
        an exceedingly great army.
037:011 Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
        house of Israel:  behold, they say, Our bones are dried up,
        and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
037:012 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you
        to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring
        you into the land of Israel.
037:013 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves,
        and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.
037:014 I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place
        you in your own land:  and you shall know that I, Yahweh,
        have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.
037:015 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
037:016 You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah,
        and for the children of Israel his companions:  then take
        another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim,
        and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:
037:017 and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they
        may become one in your hand.
037:018 When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying,
        Will you not show us what you mean by these?
037:019 tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take
        the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim,
        and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them
        with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick,
        and they shall be one in my hand.
037:020 The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
037:021 Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take
        the children of Israel from among the nations, where they
        are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them
        into their own land:
037:022 and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains
        of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they
        shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
        into two kingdoms any more at all;
037:023 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
        nor with their detestable things, nor with any of
        their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their
        dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them:
        so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
037:024 My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall
        have one shepherd:  they shall also walk in my ordinances,
        and observe my statutes, and do them.
037:025 They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant,
        in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they,
        and their children, and their children's children, forever:
        and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
        be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them,
        and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst
        of them forevermore.
037:027 My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God,
        and they shall be my people.
037:028 The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel,
        when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.
038:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
038:002 Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog,
        the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
038:003 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,
        Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
038:004 and I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I
        will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen,
        all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler
        and shield, all of them handling swords;
038:005 Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
038:006 Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in
        the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes;
        even many peoples with you.
038:007 Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies
        who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.
038:008 After many days you shall be visited:  in the latter years you
        shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword,
        that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel,
        which have been a continual waste; but it is brought
        forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely,
        all of them.
038:009 You shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall
        be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes,
        and many peoples with you.
038:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  It shall happen in that day,
        that things shall come into your mind, and you shall devise
        an evil device:
038:011 and you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages;
        I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely,
        all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither
        bars nor gates;
038:012 to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn your hand
        against the waste places that are [now] inhabited,
        and against the people who are gathered out of the nations,
        who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle
        of the earth.
038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all
        the young lions of it, shall tell you, Are you come to take
        the spoil? have you assembled your company to take the prey?
        to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods,
        to take great spoil?
038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, Thus says the
        Lord Yahweh:  In that day when my people Israel dwells securely,
        shall you not know it?
038:015 You shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts
        of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them
        riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army;
038:016 and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud
        to cover the land:  it shall happen in the latter days, that I
        will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me,
        when I shall be sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.
038:017 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Are you he of whom I spoke in old
        time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in
        those days for [many] years that I would bring you against them?
038:018 It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land
        of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh, that my wrath shall come up
        into my nostrils.
038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
        Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the
        land of Israel;
038:020 so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky,
        and the animals of the field, and all creeping things who
        creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the surface
        of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains
        shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall,
        and every wall shall fall to the ground.
038:021 I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains,
        says the Lord Yahweh:  every man's sword shall be
        against his brother.
038:022 With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment
        with him; and I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on
        the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower,
        and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
038:023 I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make
        myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
039:001 You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says
        the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince
        of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
039:002 and I will turn you about, and will lead you on, and will
        cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north;
        and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel;
039:003 and I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause
        your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
039:004 You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all
        your hordes, and the peoples who are with you:
        I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort,
        and to the animals of the field to be devoured.
039:005 You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken it,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
039:006 I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely
        in the islands; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
039:007 My holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel;
        neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more:
        and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel.
039:008 Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh;
        this is the day about which I have spoken.
039:009 Those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
        and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them,
        both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows,
        and the war clubs, and the spears, and they shall make fires
        of them seven years;
039:010 so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
        down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of
        the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them,
        and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Yahweh.
039:011 It shall happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place
        for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass through on
        the east of the sea; and it shall stop those who pass through:
        and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude;
        and they shall call it The valley of Hamon Gog.
039:012 Seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them,
        that they may cleanse the land.
039:013 Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
        be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
039:014 They shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass
        through the land, and, with those who pass through, those who bury
        those who remain on the surface of the land, to cleanse it:
        after the end of seven months shall they search.
039:015 Those who pass through the land shall pass through;
        and when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign
        by it, until the undertakers have buried it in the valley
        of Hamon Gog.
039:016 Hamonah shall also be the name of a city.  Thus shall they
        cleanse the land.
039:017 You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Speak to
        the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field,
        Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side
        to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
        sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh
        and drink blood.
039:018 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood
        of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats,
        of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
039:019 You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you
        be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
039:020 You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
        with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord Yahweh.
039:021 I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations
        shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
        have laid on them.
039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God,
        from that day and forward.
039:023 The nations shall know that the house of Israel went into
        captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me,
        and I hid my face from them:  so I gave them into the hand
        of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their
        transgressions did I to them; and I hid my face from them.
039:025 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Now will I bring back
        the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house
        of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
039:026 They shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by
        which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell
        securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
039:027 when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered
        them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them
        in the sight of many nations.
039:028 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused
        them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered
        them to their own land; and I will leave none of them
        any more there;
039:029 neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured
        out my Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh.
040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
        of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth
        year after that the city was struck, in the same day,
        the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there.
040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
        and set me down on a very high mountain, whereon was as it
        were the frame of a city on the south.
040:003 He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man,
        whose appearance was like the appearance of brass,
        with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed;
        and he stood in the gate.
040:004 The man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear
        with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall
        show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you,
        are you brought here:  declare all that you see to the
        house of Israel.
040:005 Behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about,
        and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long,
        of a cubit and a handbreadth each:  so he measured the thickness
        of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
040:006 Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went
        up the steps of it:  and he measured the threshold of the gate,
        one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
040:007 Every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad;
        and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits;
        and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward
        the house was one reed.
040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits;
        and the posts of it, two cubits; and the porch of the gate
        was toward the house.
040:010 The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side,
        and three on that side; they three were of one measure:
        and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
040:011 He measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits;
        and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
040:012 and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side],
        and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges,
        six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
040:013 He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to
        the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits;
        door against door.
040:014 He made also posts, sixty cubits; and the court [reached]
        to the posts, round about the gate.
040:015 [From] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront
        of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
040:016 There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts
        within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches;
        and windows were round about inward; and on [each] post
        were palm trees.
040:017 Then brought he me into the outer court; and behold, there were
        chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about:
        thirty chambers were on the pavement.
040:018 The pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to
        the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate
        to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits,
        [both] on the east and on the north.
040:020 The gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north,
        he measured the length of it and the breadth of it.
040:021 The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side;
        and the posts of it and the arches of it were after the measure
        of the first gate:  the length of it was fifty cubits,
        and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:022 The windows of it, and the arches of it, and the palm trees
        of it, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect
        is toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps;
        and the arches of it were before them.
040:023 There was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate,
        [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate
        to gate one hundred cubits.
040:024 He led me toward the south; and behold, a gate toward the south:
        and he measured the posts of it and the arches of it according
        to these measures.
040:025 There were windows in it and in the arches of it round about,
        like those windows:  the length was fifty cubits,
        and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:026 There were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches of it
        were before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side,
        and another on that side, on the posts of it.
040:027 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south:
        and he measured from gate to gate toward the south
        a hundred cubits.
040:028 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate:
        and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
040:029 and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,
        according to these measures:  and there were windows in it
        and in the arches of it round about; it was fifty cubits long,
        and twenty-five cubits broad.
040:030 There were arches round about, twenty-five cubits long,
        and five cubits broad.
040:031 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
        were on the posts of it:  and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:032 He brought me into the inner court toward the east:
        and he measured the gate according to these measures;
040:033 and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,
        according to these measures:  and there were windows therein
        and in the arches of it round about; it was fifty cubits long,
        and twenty-five cubits broad.
040:034 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
        were on the posts of it, on this side, and on that side:
        and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:035 He brought me to the north gate:  and he measured [it] according
        to these measures;
040:036 the lodges of it, the posts of it, and the arches of it:
        and there were windows therein round about; the length was
        fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:037 The posts of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
        were on the posts of it, on this side, and on that side:
        and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:038 A chamber with the door of it was by the posts at the gates;
        there they washed the burnt offering.
040:039 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side,
        and two tables on that side, to kill thereon the burnt offering
        and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
040:040 On the [one] side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate
        toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side,
        which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.
040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
        by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they
        killed [the sacrifices].
040:042 There were four tables for the burnt offering, of hewn stone,
        a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad,
        and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments
        with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
040:043 The hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about:
        and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
040:044 Outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers
        in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate;
        and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side
        of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
040:045 He said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south,
        is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;
040:046 and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is
        for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar:
        these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi
        come near to Yahweh to minister to him.
040:047 He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred
        cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.
040:048 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
        post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits
        on that side:  and the breadth of the gate was three cubits
        on this side, and three cubits on that side.
040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
        eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it:
        and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side,
        and another on that side.
041:001 He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits
        broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,
        which was the breadth of the tent.
041:002 The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides
        of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five
        cubits on the other side:  and he measured the length of it,
        forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
041:003 Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance,
        two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth
        of the entrance, seven cubits.
041:004 He measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth,
        twenty cubits, before the temple:  and he said to me,
        This is the most holy place.
041:005 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits;
        and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits,
        round about the house on every side.
041:006 The side chambers were in three stories, one over another,
        and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which
        belonged to the house for the side chambers round about,
        that they might have hold [therein], and not have hold
        in the wall of the house.
041:007 The side chambers were broader as they encompassed [the
        house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of
        the house went higher and higher round about the house:
        therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward;
        and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest
        by the middle [chamber].
041:008 I saw also that the house had a raised base round about:
        the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed
        of six great cubits.
041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers,
        on the outside, was five cubits:  and that which was left was
        the place of the side chambers that belonged to the house.
041:010 Between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round
        about the house on every side.
041:011 The doors of the side chambers were toward [the place] that was left,
        one door toward the north, and another door toward the south:
        and the breadth of the place that was left was five
        cubits round about.
041:012 The building that was before the separate place at the side
        toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of
        the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
        of it ninety cubits.
041:013 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long;
        and the separate place, and the building, with the walls of it,
        one hundred cubits long;
041:014 also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
        place toward the east, one hundred cubits.
041:015 He measured the length of the building before the separate
        place which was at the back of it, and the galleries of it
        on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits;
        and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
041:016 the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round
        about on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood
        ceilings round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows,
        (now the windows were covered),
041:017 to [the space] above the door, even to the inner house, and outside,
        and by all the wall round about inside and outside, by measure.
041:018 It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was
        between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
041:019 so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on
        the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm
        tree on the other side.  [thus was it] made through all
        the house round about:
041:020 from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made:
        thus was the wall of the temple.
041:021 As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face
        of the sanctuary, the appearance [of it] was as the appearance
        [of the temple].
041:022 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it
        two cubits; and the corners of it, and the length of it,
        and the walls of it, were of wood:  and he said to me,
        This is the table that is before Yahweh.
041:023 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
041:024 The doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves:
        two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
041:025 There were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
        cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls;
        and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.
041:026 There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side
        and on the other side, on the sides of the porch:
        thus were the side chambers of the house, and the thresholds.
042:001 Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward
        the north:  and he brought me into the chamber that was
        over against the separate place, and which was over against
        the building toward the north.
042:002 Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door,
        and the breadth was fifty cubits.
042:003 Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court,
        and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court,
        was gallery against gallery in the third story.
042:004 Before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward,
        a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took
        away from these, more than from the lower and the middle,
        in the building.
042:006 For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars
        as the pillars of the courts:  therefore [the uppermost] was
        straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.
042:007 The wall that was outside by the side of the chambers,
        toward the outer court before the chambers, the length of it
        was fifty cubits.
042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court
        was fifty cubits:  and behold, before the temple were
        one hundred cubits.
042:009 From under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
        as one goes into them from the outer court.
042:010 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east,
        before the separate place, and before the building,
        there were chambers.
042:011 The way before them was like the appearance of [the way of]
        the chambers which were toward the north; according to their
        length so was their breadth:  and all their exits were both
        according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
042:012 According to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south
        was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly
        before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
042:013 Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
        which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers,
        where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most
        holy things:  there shall they lay the most holy things, and the
        meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering;
        for the place is holy.
042:014 When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of
        the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay
        their garments in which they minister; for they are holy:
        and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach
        to that which pertains to the people.
042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,
        he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect
        is toward the east, and measured it round about.
042:016 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five
        hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
042:017 He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring
        reed round about.
042:018 He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with
        the measuring reed.
042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
        reeds with the measuring reed.
042:020 He measured it on the four sides:  it had a wall round about,
        the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred,
        to make a separation between that which was holy and that
        which was common.
043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks
        toward the east.
043:002 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
        of the east:  and his voice was like the sound of many waters;
        and the earth shined with his glory.
043:003 It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
        even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy
        the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw
        by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
043:004 The glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate
        whose prospect is toward the east.
043:005 The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
        and behold, the glory of Yahweh filled the house.
043:006 I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man
        stood by me.
043:007 He said to me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne,
        and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will
        dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever.
        The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name,
        neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution,
        and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places;
043:008 in their setting of their threshold by my threshold,
        and their doorpost beside my doorpost, and there was [but]
        the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy
        name by their abominations which they have committed:
        therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
043:009 Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies
        of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst
        of them forever.
043:010 You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel,
        that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them
        measure the pattern.
043:011 If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them
        the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and the exits
        of it, and the entrances of it, and all the forms of it,
        and all the ordinances of it, and all the forms of it,
        and all the laws of it; and write it in their sight; that they
        may keep the whole form of it, and all the ordinances of it,
        and do them.
043:012 This is the law of the house:  on the top of the mountain
        the whole limit of it round about shall be most holy.
        Behold, this is the law of the house.
043:013 These are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit
        is a cubit and a handbreadth):  the bottom shall be a cubit,
        and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by the edge of it
        round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.
043:014 From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall
        be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from
        the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits,
        and the breadth a cubit.
043:015 The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth
        and upward there shall be four horns.
043:016 The altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad,
        square in the four sides of it.
043:017 The ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad
        in the four sides of it; and the border about it shall be half
        a cubit; and the bottom of it shall be a cubit round about;
        and the steps of it shall look toward the east.
043:018 He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  These are
        the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it,
        to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
043:019 You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of
        the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,
        says the Lord Yahweh, a young bull for a sin offering.
043:020 You shall take of the blood of it, and put it on the four horns of it,
        and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about:
        thus shall you cleanse it and make atonement for it.
043:021 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering,
        and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house,
        outside of the sanctuary.
043:022 On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish
        for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar,
        as they did cleanse it with the bull.
043:023 When you have made an end of cleansing it, you shall offer a young
        bull without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
043:024 You shall bring them near before Yahweh, and the priests shall
        cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt
        offering to Yahweh.
043:025 Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering:
        they shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of
        the flock, without blemish.
043:026 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it;
        so shall they consecrate it.
043:027 When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on
        the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your
        burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings;
        and I will accept you, says the Lord Yahweh.
044:001 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary,
        which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
044:002 Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened,
        neither shall any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
044:003 As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread
        before Yahweh; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate,
        and shall go out by the way of the same.
044:004 Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house;
        and I looked, and behold, the glory of Yahweh filled the house
        of Yahweh:  and I fell on my face.
044:005 Yahweh said to me, Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes,
        and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all
        the ordinances of the house of Yahweh, and all the laws of it;
        and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit
        of the sanctuary.
044:006 You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says
        the Lord Yahweh:  you house of Israel, let it suffice you
        of all your abominations,
044:007 in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in
        heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary,
        to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread,
        the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant,
        [to add] to all your abominations.
044:008 You have not kept the charge of my holy things; but you have
        set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
044:009 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart
        and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary,
        of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel.
044:010 But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray,
        who went astray from me after their idols, they shall
        bear their iniquity.
044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight
        at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house:
        they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people,
        and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
044:012 Because they ministered to them before their idols,
        and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house
        of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them,
        says the Lord Yahweh, and they shall bear their iniquity.
044:013 They shall not come near to me, to execute the office
        of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things,
        to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame,
        and their abominations which they have committed.
044:014 Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all
        the service of it, and for all that shall be done therein.
044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept
        the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went
        astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me;
        and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and
        the blood, says the Lord Yahweh:
044:016 they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
        to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
044:017 It shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the
        inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments;
        and no wool shall come on them, while they minister in the gates
        of the inner court, and within.
044:018 They shall have linen tires on their heads, and shall have linen
        breeches on their waists; they shall not gird themselves
        with [anything that causes] sweat.
044:019 When they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer
        court to the people, they shall put off their garments
        in which they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers;
        and they shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify
        the people with their garments.
044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks
        to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
044:021 Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter
        into the inner court.
044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is
        put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house
        of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
044:023 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy
        and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean
        and the clean.
044:024 In a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my
        ordinances shall they judge it:  and they shall keep my laws
        and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall
        make my Sabbaths holy.
044:025 They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves;
        but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
        for brother, or for sister who has had no husband,
        they may defile themselves.
044:026 After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
044:027 In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court,
        to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
044:028 They shall have an inheritance:  I am their inheritance; and you
        shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
044:029 They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering,
        and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel
        shall be theirs.
044:030 The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering
        of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for the priest:
        you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough,
        to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
044:031 The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself,
        or is torn, whether it be bird or animal.
045:001 Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
        you shall offer an offering to Yahweh, a holy portion
        of the land; the length shall be the length of twenty-five
        thousand [reeds], and the breadth shall be ten thousand:
        it shall be holy in all the border of it round about.
045:002 Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in
        length] by five hundred [in breadth], square round about;
        and fifty cubits for the suburbs of it round about.
045:003 Of this measure shall you measure a length of twenty-five thousand,
        and a breadth of ten thousand:  and in it shall be the sanctuary,
        which is most holy.
045:004 It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests,
        the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Yahweh;
        and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place
        for the sanctuary.
045:005 Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth,
        shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house,
        for a possession to themselves, [for] twenty chambers.
045:006 You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad,
        and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the offering
        of the holy portion:  it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
045:007 [Whatever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on
        the other side of the holy offering and of the possession
        of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front
        of the possession of the city, on the west side westward,
        and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable to one
        of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
045:008 In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel:
        and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall
        give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
045:009 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Let it suffice you, princes of Israel:
        remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness;
        dispossessing my people, says the Lord Yahweh.
045:010 You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
        may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth
        part of a homer:  the measure of it shall be after the homer.
045:012 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.  Twenty shekels plus
        twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your mina.
045:013 This is the offering that you shall offer:  the sixth part
        of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you shall give the sixth
        part of an ephah from a homer of barley;
045:014 and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part
        of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer;
        (for ten baths are a homer;)
045:015 and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered
        pastures of Israel--for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering,
        and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
045:016 All the people of the land shall give to this offering for
        the prince in Israel.
045:017 It shall be the prince's part to give the burnt offerings,
        and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings,
        in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths,
        in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel:
        he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering,
        and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make
        atonement for the house of Israel.
045:018 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the first [month], in the first
        [day] of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish;
        and you shall cleanse the sanctuary.
045:019 The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
        and put it on the door posts of the house, and on the four
        corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate
        of the inner court.
045:020 So you shall do on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone
        who errs, and for him who is simple:  so shall you make
        atonement for the house.
045:021 In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month,
        you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days;
        unleavened bread shall be eaten.
045:022 On that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all
        the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
045:023 The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
        to Yahweh, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily
        the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
045:024 He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bull,
        and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
045:025 In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month,
        in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days;
        according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering,
        and according to the meal offering, and according to the oil.
046:001 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The gate of the inner court that
        looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
        but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day
        of the new moon it shall be opened.
046:002 The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside,
        and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests
        shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
        and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
        then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut
        until the evening.
046:003 The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate
        before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
046:004 The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh
        shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a
        ram without blemish;
046:005 and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram,
        and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give,
        and a hin of oil to an ephah.
046:006 On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish,
        and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:
046:007 and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull,
        and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according
        as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
046:008 When the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch
        of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.
046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before Yahweh
        in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north
        gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate;
        and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go
        forth by the way of the north gate:  he shall not return
        by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go
        forth straight before him.
046:010 The prince, when they go in, shall go in with of them;
        and when they go out, he shall go out.
046:011 In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering
        shall be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram,
        and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil
        to an ephah.
046:012 When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt
        offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to Yahweh,
        one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east;
        and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
        as he does on the Sabbath day:  then he shall go forth;
        and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
046:013 You shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a
        burnt offering to Yahweh daily:  morning by morning shall
        you prepare it.
046:014 You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning,
        the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil,
        to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to Yahweh continually
        by a perpetual ordinance.
046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering,
        and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
046:016 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  If the prince give a gift to any
        of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons;
        it is their possession by inheritance.
046:017 But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants,
        it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall
        return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall
        be for his sons.
046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance,
        to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give
        inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my
        people not be scattered every man from his possession.
046:019 Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
        of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests,
        which looked toward the north:  and behold, there was a place
        on the hinder part westward.
046:020 He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil
        the trespass offering and the sin offering, [and] where they
        shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them forth
        into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
046:021 Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused
        me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold,
        in every corner of the court there was a court.
046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed,
        forty [cubits] long and thirty broad:  these four in the corners
        were of one measure.
046:023 There was a wall round about in them, round about the four,
        and boiling places were made under the walls round about.
046:024 Then said he to me, These are the boiling houses, where the
        ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
047:001 He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold,
        waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward;
        (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;)
        and the waters came down from under, from the right side
        of the house, on the south of the altar.
047:002 Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward,
        and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate,
        by the way of [the gate] that looks toward the east;
        and behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
047:003 When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand,
        he measured one thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass
        through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
047:004 Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through
        the waters, waters that were to the knees.  Again he measured
        one thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters],
        waters that were to the waist.
047:005 Afterward he measured one thousand; [and it was] a river
        that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen,
        waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
047:006 He said to me, Son of man, have you seen [this]?
        Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank
        of the river.
047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river
        were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
047:008 Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward
        the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah;
        and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall
        the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters
        shall be healed.
047:009 It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms,
        in every place where the rivers come, shall live; and there
        shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters
        are come there, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed,
        and everything shall live wherever the river comes.
047:010 It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it:
        from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the
        spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds,
        as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
047:011 But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not
        be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
047:012 By the river on the bank of it, on this side and on that side,
        shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither,
        neither shall the fruit of it fail:  it shall bring forth
        new fruit every month, because the waters of it issue out
        of the sanctuary; and the fruit of it shall be for food,
        and the leaf of it for healing.
047:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This shall be the border, by which you
        shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve
        tribes of Israel:  Joseph [shall have two] portions.
047:014 You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore
        to give it to your fathers:  and this land shall fall
        to you for inheritance.
047:015 This shall be the border of the land:  On the north side,
        from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border
        of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon,
        which is by the border of Hauran.
047:017 The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border
        of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath.
        This is the north side.
047:018 The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead,
        and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan;
        from the [north] border to the east sea shall you measure.
        This is the east side.
047:019 The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters
        of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.
        This is the south side southward.
047:020 The west side shall be the great sea, from the [south]
        border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath.
        This is the west side.
047:021 So shall you divide this land to you according to the
        tribes of Israel.
047:022 It shall happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an
        inheritance to you and to the strangers who sojourn among you,
        who shall father children among you; and they shall be to you
        as the native-born among the children of Israel; they shall
        have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
047:023 It shall happen, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns,
        there shall you give him his inheritance, says the Lord Yahweh.
048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes:  From the north end,
        beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar Enan
        at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they
        shall have their sides east [and] west), Dan, one [portion].
048:002 By the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side,
        Asher, one [portion].
048:003 By the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side,
        Naphtali, one [portion].
048:004 By the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side,
        Manasseh, one [portion].
048:005 By the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side,
        Ephraim, one [portion].
048:006 By the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the
        west side, Reuben, one [portion].
048:007 By the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side,
        Judah, one [portion].
048:008 By the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side,
        shall be the offering which you shall offer, twenty-five thousand
        [reeds] in breadth, and in length as one of the portions,
        from the east side to the west side:  and the sanctuary shall
        be in the midst of it.
048:009 The offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty-five
        thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in breadth.
048:010 For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering:
        toward the north twenty-five thousand [in length], and toward
        the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand
        in breadth, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length:
        and the sanctuary of Yahweh shall be in the midst of it.
048:011 [It shall be] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons
        of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who didn't go astray when
        the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
048:012 It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land,
        a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
048:013 Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have
        twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth:
        all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the
        breadth ten thousand.
048:014 They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first
        fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to Yahweh.
048:015 The five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front
        of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use,
        for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city
        shall be in the midst of it.
048:016 These shall be the measures of it:  the north side four thousand
        and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred,
        and on the east side four thousand and five hundred,
        and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
048:017 The city shall have suburbs:  toward the north two hundred fifty,
        and toward the south two hundred fifty, and toward the east
        two hundred fifty, and toward the west two hundred fifty.
048:018 The remainder in the length, answerable to the holy offering,
        shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward;
        and it shall be answerable to the holy offering; and the increase
        of it shall be for food to those who labor in the city.
048:019 Those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel,
        shall cultivate it.
048:020 All the offering shall be twenty-five thousand by
        twenty-five thousand:  you shall offer the holy offering four-square,
        with the possession of the city.
048:021 The residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on
        the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city;
        in front of the twenty-five thousand of the offering toward
        the east border, and westward in front of the twenty-five
        thousand toward the west border, answerable to the portions,
        it shall be for the prince:  and the holy offering and
        the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it.
048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession
        of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's,
        between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin,
        it shall be for the prince.
048:023 As for the rest of the tribes:  from the east side to the
        west side, Benjamin, one [portion].
048:024 By the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side,
        Simeon, one [portion].
048:025 By the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side,
        Issachar, one [portion].
048:026 By the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side,
        Zebulun, one [portion].
048:027 By the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side,
        Gad, one [portion].
048:028 By the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border
        shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh,
        to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.
048:029 This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes
        of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions,
        says the Lord Yahweh.
048:030 These are the exits of the city:  On the north side four
        thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure;
048:031 and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes
        of Israel, three gates northward:  the gate of Reuben, one;
        the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.
048:032 At the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],
        and three gates:  even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate
        of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one.
048:033 At the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds]
        by measure, and three gates:  the gate of Simeon, one; the gate
        of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.
048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],
        with their three gates:  the gate of Gad, one; the gate
        of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.
048:035 It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about:
        and the name of the city from that day shall be, Yahweh is there.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
