And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is
upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the
fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every
beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing
that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every
green herb for meat: and it was so.--Genesis i., 29, 30.

Thou shalt not kill.--Exodus xx., 13.

For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one
thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they
have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast:
for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all
turn to dust again. Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and
the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?--Ecclesiastes
iii., 19, 20, 21.

He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man.--Isaiah lxvi., 3.

Then said Daniel to Melzar [the steward], whom the prince of the eunuchs
had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: Prove thy servants,
I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water
to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat:
and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them in
this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of ten days their
countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children
which did eat the portion of the king's meat.--Daniel i., 11 to 17.




PREFACE.


I send this little book out into the world, first, to aid those who,
having decided to adopt a bloodless diet, are still asking how they can
be nourished without flesh; second, in the hope of gaining something
further to protect "the speechless ones" who, having come down through
the centuries under "the dominion of man," have in their eyes the mute,
appealing look of the helpless and oppressed. Their eloquent silence
should not ask our sympathy and aid in vain; they have a right, as our
humble brothers, to our loving care and protection, and to demand
justice and pity at our hands; and, as a part of the One Life, to--

    "life, which all can take but none can give;
     Life, which all creatures love and strive to keep;
     Wonderful, dear, and pleasant unto each,
     Even to the meanest; yea, a boon to all
     Where pity is, for pity makes the world
     Soft to the weak and noble for the strong.
     Unto the dumb lips of the flock he lent
     Sad, pleading words, showing how man, who prays
     For mercy to the gods, is merciless,
     Being as god to those; albeit all life
     Is linked and kin, and what we slay have given
     Meek tribute of their milk and wool, and set
     Fast trust upon the hands which murder them."

If the cruelty and injustice to animals are nothing to us, we have still
another argument to offer--the brutalization of the men who slaughter
that we may eat flesh. Mrs. Besant, in "Why I Am a Food Reformer," says:

"Lately I have been in the city of Chicago--one of the greatest
slaughter-houses of the world--where the slaughter-men, who are employed
from early morn till late at night in the killing of thousands of these
hapless creatures, are made a class _practically apart from their
fellow-men_; they are marked out by the police _as the most dangerous
part of the community_; amongst them are committed most crimes of
violence, and the most ready use of the knife is found. One day I was
speaking to an authority on this subject, and I asked him how it was
that he knew so decidedly that most of the murders and the crimes with
the knife were perpetrated by that particular class of men, and his
answer was suggestive, although horrible. He said: 'There is a peculiar
turn of the knife which men learn to use in the slaughter-house, for, as
the living creatures are brought to them by machinery, these men slit
their throats as they pass by. That twist of the wrist is the
characteristic of most crimes with the knife committed amongst our
Chicago population.' That struck me at once as both a horrible and
significant fact. _What right have people to condemn other men to a
trade that makes them so readily take to the knife in anger; which marks
them out as specially brutalized--brutes amongst their fellow-men?_
Being constantly in the sight and the smell of blood, their whole nature
is coarsened; accustomed to kill thousands of creatures, they lose all
sense of reverence for sentient life, they grow indifferent to the
suffering they continually see around them; accustomed to inflict pain,
they grow callous to the sight of pain; accustomed to kill swiftly, and
sometimes not even waiting until the creature is dead before the skin is
stripped from it, their nerves become coarsened, hardened, and
brutalized, and they are less men as men because they are slaughterers
of animals. _And everyone who eats flesh meat has part in that
brutalization; everyone who uses what they provide is guilty of this
degradation of his fellow-men._

"If I may not appeal to you in the name of the animals--if under
mistaken views you regard animals as not sharing _your kind of
life_--then I appeal to you in the name of _human brotherhood_, and
remind you of your duty to your fellow-men, your duty to your nation,
which must be built up partly of the children of those who
slaughter--who physically inherit the very signs of this brutalizing
occupation. I ask you to recognize your duty as men and women who should
_raise_ the Race, not _degrade_ it; who should try to make it _divine_,
not _brutal_; who should try to make it _pure_, not _foul_; and
therefore, in the name of Human Brotherhood, I appeal to you to leave
your own tables free from the stain of blood and your consciences free
from the degradation of your fellow-men."

That flesh-eating is not necessary to the perfect health of man is
attested by many scientists. The following testimonies from some very
prominent physiologists and anatomists may prove interesting:

Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S.: "It is, I think, not going too far to say
that every fact connected with the human organization goes to prove that
man was originally formed a frugivorous animal. This opinion is
principally derived from the formation of his teeth and digestive
organs, as well as from the character of his skin and the general
structure of his limbs."

Sylvester Graham, M. D.: "Comparative anatomy proves that man is
naturally a frugivorous animal, formed to subsist upon fruits, seeds,
and farinaceous vegetables."

Professor Wm. Lawrence, F. R. S.: "The teeth of man have not the
slightest resemblance to those of carnivorous animals; and, whether we
consider the teeth, jaws, or digestive organs, the human structure
closely resembles that of the frugivorous animals."

Dr. Jozef Drzewiecki: "There is no doubt that fruit and vegetable food
purifies the blood, while meat inflames and is the source of many
diseases, which are the punishment for breaking the natural law and
command."

Professor Vogt: "The vegetarian diet is the most beneficial and
agreeable to our organs, as it contains the greatest amount of carbon
hydrates and the best proportion of albumen."

Sir Henry Thompson, M. D., F. R. C. S.: "It is a vulgar error to regard
meat in any form as necessary to life. All that is necessary to the
human body can be supplied by the vegetable kingdom.... The vegetarian
can extract from his food all the principles necessary for the growth
and support of the body, as well as for the production of heat and
force. It must be admitted as a fact beyond all question that some
persons are stronger and more healthy who live on that food. I know how
much of the prevailing meat diet is not merely a wasteful extravagance,
but a source of serious evil to the consumer."

The following special cablegram from London to the New York "Sun," July
3d, 1898, contains a practical illustration of the superiority of a
vegetable diet:

"The vegetarians are making a great ado over the triumph of their theory
in the long-distance test of walking endurance, seventy miles, in
Germany, this week. The twenty-two starters included eight vegetarians.
The distance had to be covered within eighteen hours. The first six to
arrive were vegetarians, the first finishing in 14 ¼ hours, the second
in 14 ½, the third in 15 ½, the fourth in 16, the fifth in 16 ½, and the
sixth in 17 ½. The last two vegetarians missed their way and walked five
miles more. All reached the goal in splendid condition. Not till one
hour after the last vegetarian did the first meat-eater appear,
completely exhausted. He was the only one. Others dropped off after
thirty-five miles."

There is no question of the great economy of vegetarianism. Dr. Alcott,
in "Arguments for Vegetarianism," says:

"Twenty-two acres of land are needed to sustain one man on fresh meat.
Under wheat that land will feed forty-two people; under oats,
eighty-eight; under potatoes, maize, or rice, one hundred and
seventy-six; under the banana, over six thousand. The crowded nations of
the future must abandon flesh-eating for a diet that will feed more than
tenfold people by the same soil, expense and labor. How rich men will be
when they cease to toll for flesh-meat, alcohol, drugs, sickness, and
war!"

    "Suffer the ox to plough, and impute his death to age and Nature's
        hand.
    Let the sheep continue to yield us sheltering wool, and the goats
        the produce of their loaded udders.
    Banish from among you nets and snares and painful artifices,
    Conspire no longer against the birds, nor scare the meek deer, nor
        hide with fraud the crooked hook; ....
    But let your mouths be empty of blood, and satisfied with pure and
        natural repasts."[1]

Bread, Biscuit, and Rolls.


BEATEN BISCUIT.--No. 1.

One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted with the
flour, a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, a large heaping tablespoonful
of butter, milk enough to make a stiff dough. Beat with a rolling pin or
in a biscuit-beater for ten or fifteen minutes until the dough blisters.
Roll out about half an inch thick or less, prick well with a fork and
bake in a quick oven.


BEATEN BISCUIT.--No. 2.

Two quarts of flour, three ounces of butter, a little salt and enough
water to make a stiff dough. Beat with a rolling pin or in a
biscuit-beater twenty minutes until the dough blisters or snaps. Roll
out about half an inch thick, prick well with a fork and bake in a quick
oven. This dough rolled very thin, cut with a large cutter, pricked well
and baked in a quick oven makes delicious wafers to serve with tea or
chocolate.


BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT.

One quart of sifted flour, three-quarters of a cup of butter, two
heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one teaspoonful of salt, enough
milk to make a soft dough. Do not handle any more than is necessary.
Roll thin, cut in small biscuits, prick with a fork and bake in a quick
oven.


CREAM BISCUIT.

One quart of flour sifted, two rounded teaspoonfuls of Cleveland's
baking powder, two cupfuls of cream and a little salt. Mix, roll out
about a quarter of an inch thick, cut with a small biscuit-cutter, prick
with a fork and bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a quick oven.


FRENCH ROLLS.

Two quarts of sifted flour, a pint of warm milk, half a cup of butter
melted in the milk, a quarter of a cup of sugar, three or four eggs
beaten light, a little salt, a half cake of compressed yeast, dissolved
in a little warm milk. Make a batter of the milk and flour, add the eggs
and sugar, beat hard for fifteen minutes. Cover the pan and set to rise,
over night if for luncheon, in the morning if for tea. Knead well, but
do not add any more flour. Make them into shape and let them rise again
until light. Bake about fifteen minutes in a quick oven. For buns add
cinnamon. Sift the flour before measuring, and measure lightly.


RAISED FINGER-ROLLS.

Half a pint of milk, half a pint of water, one-third of a compressed
yeast cake, one teaspoonful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of butter, one
teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve the yeast cake in a little tepid water,
mix as usual, make into a soft dough at night, bake for breakfast or
luncheon.


WINDSOR ROLLS.

Melt half a cup of butter in three-quarters of a pint of warm milk,
dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in a little tepid milk, stir
together and add a teaspoonful of salt and enough flour to make like
bread dough, set to rise in a warm place. It will rise in about two
hours. Roll out the dough, using as little flour as possible to keep it
from sticking, and cut with a biscuit-cutter, or mould with the hands
into rolls, put them in pans, and set on the shelf over the range to
rise about ten or fifteen minutes. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes.


ELIZABETTI ROLLS.

One cup of sweet milk, half a yeast cake, an even tablespoonful of
butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and one of salt, and flour enough to
make as stiff as bread dough. Scald the milk and melt the butter in it,
when lukewarm dissolve the yeast cake, sugar and salt and stir the flour
in until as thick as bread dough. Set to rise over night. In the morning
roll thin, cut with a biscuit-cutter, put a tiny lump of butter on each
biscuit, fold in half, set to rise again, and when light bake about
twenty minutes in a moderate oven. This quantity will make twenty-four
rolls.


RYE ROLLS.

Take in the morning from rye bread dough one cupful, add to it a
tablespoonful of Porto Rico molasses, one tablespoonful of sour cream,
one even tablespoonful of butter. Bake in cups, half fill them, set in a
warm place to rise for three-quarters of an hour, and bake fifteen
minutes. This quantity will make eight.


GLUTEN ROLLS.

Three cups of kernel flour, two even tablespoonfuls of baking powder,
half a teaspoonful of salt, two cups of milk. Mix the flour, salt and
baking powder together, then stir in the milk, beat well. If baked in
iron roll pans heat them well, brush with butter; if granite ware, only
grease them. This quantity will make sixteen rolls. Bake from twenty to
twenty-five minutes.


PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.

Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoonful of salt and one
teaspoonful of sugar, then add a cup of tepid water in which a cake of
compressed yeast has been dissolved, two tablespoonfuls of melted
butter; when mixed break in one egg and add flour enough to make a soft
dough. Knead well, beating the dough upon the board. Set to rise in a
warm place, when light knead again, adding only enough flour to keep
from sticking to the board, roll out about half an inch thick, cut with
a biscuit-cutter, brush with melted butter, fold in half and set to rise
again. These rolls can be set at noon if for tea, or in the morning if
for luncheon, or they can be made up at night for breakfast, when use
only half a yeast cake. This dough can be moulded into small, oblong
rolls for afternoon teas.


BOSTON BROWN BREAD.

One cup of yellow corn meal, one cup and a half of Graham flour, an even
teaspoonful of salt, an even teaspoonful of soda, two cups of sour milk,
half a cup of Porto Rico molasses, and butter the size of a large
walnut. Sift the corn meal and soda together, add the Graham flour and
salt, then the milk and molasses, melt the butter and stir in at the
last. Butter a brown bread mould, pour in the mixture, steam for three
hours, keep the water steadily boiling, remove the cover of the mould,
and bake twenty minutes in the oven to form a crust.


BOSTON BROWN BREAD WITH RAISINS.

Follow the preceding recipe, adding a cup of raisins stoned and slightly
chopped. Very nice for nut sandwiches and stewed bread.


BOSTON BROWN BREAD STEWED.

Cut the bread into dice, and when the milk boils add the bread and stew
gently fifteen minutes. The proportion is about a cup of milk to one of
bread.


GRAHAM BREAD.

Half a pint of milk, half a pint of water, a pint and a half of white
flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, half a yeast cake dissolved in tepid

to cool. Put the flour into the bread pan, add milk and water when
lukewarm and the dissolved yeast; beat well. In the morning add half a
cup of Porto Rico molasses and Graham flour enough to knead well, let it
rise for three hours, knead again, make into loaves and set in a warm
place to rise. When light bake in a moderate oven nearly an hour.


RYE BREAD.

Dissolve half a yeast cake, two heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar and one of
salt in a cup and a third of tepid water, then stir into it a pint of
white flour, and when smooth add enough rye flour to make a dough rather
stiffer than that of white bread. Knead thoroughly about fifteen minutes
and set to rise. In the morning make into a loaf and put in a crusty
bread pan.


QUICK WHITE BREAD.

Three pints of flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, two cakes of
compressed yeast dissolved in tepid water and enough milk to make a soft
dough. Set in the morning,--it will require about an hour and a half to
rise, and, after making into loaves, about ten minutes.


DATE BREAD.

Break the dates apart, wash and drain them in a colander, shake them
well, set in a warm place to dry. Stone and chop enough to make a
cupful, and knead into a loaf of white bread just before setting to rise
for the last time.


COFFEE BREAD.--No. 1.

One pound of flour, two eggs, six tablespoonfuls of melted butter, six
ounces of sugar, a teaspoonful of soda, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar
mixed dry in the flour, and one cup and a half of milk. Beat the butter
and sugar together, add the eggs well beaten, a few grains of cardamom,
half a cupful of raisins seeded, and a tablespoonful of citron cut fine,
if liked, then add the milk and flour. Bake in crusty bread pans or
shallow pans, as convenient.

Half a pound of flour, one egg, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, a small pinch
of salt, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, three-quarters of a cup

of tartar. Mix and bake in a crusty bread pan in a good oven, not too
quick, from twenty to twenty-five minutes.


NORWEGIAN ROLLS.

Two pounds and a half of flour, a pint and a half of milk, half a pound
of butter, six ounces of sugar, one even teaspoonful of cardamom seeds
pounded fine, and one cake of compressed yeast. Melt the butter in the
milk, mix the sugar, flour and cardamom together and stir the butter and
milk into it with the yeast cake dissolved in a little milk, mix
thoroughly and set to rise. When it is nicely raised, roll out the dough
and cut with a biscuit-cutter, put in pans to rise again,--if they can
be raised over steam it is better. When light bake in a quick oven. If
zwieback are wanted, cut the biscuit in half when cold and set them in
the oven to brown. If wanted very nice, brush each half over with white
of egg and sprinkle with sugar and chopped almonds. The cardamom seed
may be omitted if not liked.


RICE MUFFINS.

Boil a scant half cup of rice in salted water half an hour, drain well,

Stir into it while hot a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Beat one egg
light, add to the rice and butter with a little salt, sift half a pint
of flour with half a teaspoonful of baking powder, and stir in
alternately with half a pint of milk. Pour the mixture into muffin rings

to the batter when lukewarm. The milk and water mixed must be stirred
into the flour while hot. Beat the batter very hard, ten or fifteen
minutes; it should be a soft dough. Set to rise over night. Flour the
board well, drop the dough in large spoonfuls in the flour, flatten with
the hands and form into shape. Let them rise on the board in a warm
place, and when light bake on a griddle, heated only half as hot as for
griddle cakes. Flour the muffins and bake slowly on one side six
minutes; then turn and bake the same on the other side. They are very
nice split and toasted and buttered immediately and put together again.

the warm milk, then pepper and salt to taste, and if liked a few drops
of onion juice. Stir constantly until thick and smooth, remove from the
fire, add the prepared eggs, mix well, and when cold form into the shape

chopped very fine; have it hot and add to the omelet just before folding

POACHED EGGS WITH TOMATO CATSUP.

Poach some eggs in boiling water, trim nicely and place each egg on a
round of toast buttered and moistened with a little hot milk. Have ready
a white sauce, pour it over them and put on the top of each egg a
teaspoonful of tomato catsup; garnish with parsley and serve.


EGGS POACHED IN CREAM.

Half a pint of cream, six eggs, salt and white pepper, and a small
teaspoonful of finely minced parsley. Bring the cream to a boil in a
chafing dish, break the eggs carefully, to keep the yolks whole, into
the cream and cook until the whites are set--about three minutes. Have a

onion, three cloves, a bay leaf, a sprig of parsley, a saltspoonful of
sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the onion is
tender--about ten minutes--remove from the fire, press through a sieve
fine enough to retain the seeds. Put this in a spider; rub an even
teaspoonful of potato flour with a tablespoonful of butter, add to the
sauce, and when it boils break in as many eggs as required, keep them
from sticking to the pan by running a tablespoon carefully around the
edges; when the eggs are set remove from the sauce, place each one on a
round of nice toast and pour the sauce around them; garnish with parsley
and serve.

vegetable stock to make the sauce the proper consistency, season with
salt and pepper and strain. Put the egg slices in the sauce, let it come
to the boiling point and serve on a small platter; garnish with parsley.
Half a dozen olives boiled in a little water and cut from the stones are
a nice addition to the sauce.




Soups.


Bran tea, made in the proportion of a pint of bran to three quarts of
water, is used by many vegetarians as a foundation for soup. Butter
should be used generously with it.

A broth made from white beans is also good where a white stock is
required. Pick over the beans carefully, soak over night, drain and add
fresh water in the morning--three pints of water to a pint of
beans--cook gently until tender. If it is to be used as a stock, strain
without mashing the beans. If the water they are boiled in is hard, a
small pinch of soda will soften it.

boil, season with salt and pepper to taste. Have the asparagus points
cooked tender in a little water. Have ready a pint of boiling milk,

boiled. Put back in the saucepan on the range, let it come to a boil,
then add a heaping tablespoonful of butter and a pint of boiling milk,
stir well, remove and press through a purée sieve that it may be smooth.

vegetables, cook until tender and press through a fine sieve. Bring two
cups of milk to the boiling point, turn the purée into this, let it boil
up once, remove from the fire. Beat two egg yolks and four
tablespoonfuls of rich cream together, add some of the soup to this,
then mix all together, turn into the tureen, add the flowerettes and
serve at once.


CREAM OF CELERY.

Take of the coarser parts of celery as much as will make two heads, wash
and cut in pieces, put in a saucepan with half an onion cut in slices
and cover with boiling water. Cook until tender and press through a
sieve with the water in which it was boiled. Make a roux of butter and
flour as in other cream soups, add the purée to it and as much boiling

by melting two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan with two
tablespoonfuls of flour, let them cook together until the mixture no

teaspoonful of white pepper, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, let it boil
for a few minutes until thick and pour into the cucumber purée, add two
tablespoonfuls of rich cream, let it come to the boiling point, and
serve at once. This is a very delicate soup, and cooking or standing on
the stove after it is done will spoil it. Groult's potato flour is nicer
for thickening cream soups than the common flour, but, if used, only
half the quantity called for in the recipes is needed.


CREAM OF SUMMER SQUASH.

Peel the squash, slice thin, put in a saucepan and add boiling water to

cayenne pepper, and a small half teaspoonful of sugar. Put in a fresh
saucepan, rub together two heaping teaspoonfuls of butter and an even
teaspoonful of cornstarch and stir into the soup. Let it come to the
boiling point and remove from the fire, adding at the last moment a

tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan, and stir into it two heaping
tablespoonfuls of flour, and when smooth add a quart of rich milk, a
whole clove of garlic, salt and pepper to taste. When it boils and
thickens add the mushroom stock, let it boil up once, remove the clove
of garlic, turn the soup into the tureen and serve.

sieve. Put the soup back on the fire while beating an egg yolk with two

an hour. Drain the water off and add a cup of milk to the spaghettina,
and cook nearly half an hour, until the milk is almost all absorbed.
Then make a cream sauce as follows: One cup of milk in a saucepan, rub
butter the size of an egg into a slightly heaping tablespoonful of
flour, adding a little of the warm milk, then stir into the milk on the
fire, season with salt and pepper, add two even tablespoonfuls of grated
cheese--the American Edam cheese is nice for this--and when the sauce is
thick turn the spaghettina into it, let it come to a boil, turn out on a
dish, and when cool add one egg beaten light. Butter a border mould
which holds a little more than a pint, sprinkle it with bread crumbs,
turn the mixture into it and set the mould into a pan of hot water and
bake in a moderate oven twenty-five minutes. Have a pint of nicely
stewed tomatoes seasoned to taste and thickened with bread crumbs and a
good tablespoonful of butter. Turn the spaghettina mould out on a
platter, fill the center with the stewed tomatoes, garnish with parsley
and serve. It makes a very pretty dish and is an excellent pièce de
resistance for dinner or luncheon.


SPINACH BORDER MOULD.

Prepare the spinach as in recipe for spinach pudding, butter a border
mould, dust it with bread crumbs, and press the spinach mixture into it,
put the mould into a pan of hot water in the oven, cover it to prevent
browning, and bake about twenty minutes.


A FILLING FOR THE CENTER OF MOULD OF SPINACH.

Break two eggs in a bowl, add a little salt and four tablespoonfuls of
cream and beat them slightly. Turn into a buttered tin cup and stand in
a saucepan with a little boiling water in it on the stove, cover and
cook until stiff--about three or four minutes--remove from the fire,
turn out of the mould and cut in half-inch slices and then into stars or
any fancy-shape preferred, or into dice. Make a cream sauce, turn the
spinach mould out on a platter, put a little of the sauce in the center,
then some of the egg stars, then the rest of the sauce, and finish with
the egg stars.


MOCK COD FISH BALLS.

Six medium sized potatoes, washed, peeled and boiled for ten minutes in
salted water. Drain and grate them while hot and stir in two heaping
tablespoonfuls of butter; mix thoroughly. Season with salt, cayenne
pepper to taste, and add a teaspoonful of grated onion and a
saltspoonful of mace. Beat two egg yolks light and stir well into it
with two heaping tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs. Fry brown in small
balls in boiling fat without crowding them in the basket, drain on
kitchen paper and serve very hot on a platter, garnish with parsley.


MOCK FISH BALLS IN CURRY OR CREAM SAUCE.

Five ounces of plain boiled potatoes put through a patent vegetable
strainer or mashed very fine. Add three ounces of butter and a slightly
heaping tablespoonful of Groult's potato flour, two eggs slightly beaten
and stirred in--a little at a time--a few drops of onion juice and salt
and pepper to taste. Have a saucepan of boiling salted water over the
fire, dip a tablespoon in cold water and then into the mixture and take
out in oblong balls as nicely and uniformly shaped as possible, and drop
them carefully into the boiling water, which must not boil too violently
as the mixture is tender and would cook to pieces. Put them in without
crowding and let them cook three minutes, taking them out one after
another as they are done. Put in a colander to drain while preparing
the curry sauce. Melt in a saucepan a heaping tablespoonful of butter
and add to it a heaping teaspoonful of flour, an even teaspoonful of
curry powder, stir well and add milk until of the consistency of cream
sauce. Put the balls into the sauce and let it come to a boil, remove
from the fire, and add a tablespoonful of good Madeira. Serve on a
platter, garnish with parsley and serve. The curry powder and wine may
be omitted if not liked, and the balls served in plain cream sauce.


MOCK FISH (a Norwegian dish).

Take three or four large white potatoes. Wash and peel them and boil
until only half done. Grate them, and take only the part that has passed
through the grater--that it may be light. Then weigh out half a pound.
Beat the yolks of three eggs very light with a quarter of a cup of
cream, mix with the potatoes and add three ounces of butter melted, half
a teaspoonful of grated white onion, a dash of cayenne pepper, and salt
to taste. Butter a mould well, sprinkle it with dried and sifted bread
crumbs, put the mixture in it, and set the mould in a pan of boiling
water in the oven, cover the mould and bake half an hour. Turn out
carefully on a platter, pour a cream or Hollandaise sauce around it, and
garnish with parsley. Serve very hot with a cucumber salad with French
dressing, as a fish course.


MOCK MEAT.

Put three-quarters of a cup of milk and three ounces of butter in a
saucepan on the fire. When it boils stir in three ounces of dried and
rolled bread crumbs and a slightly heaping tablespoonful of flour, and
half a teaspoonful of sugar. Let it cook until it no longer adheres to
the pan, then remove from the fire. When it is cool, add three eggs, one
at a time, beating until smooth, then add one heaping tablespoonful of
chopped walnut meats, salt and pepper to taste, and a few drops of onion
juice. Make into flat cakes, a little less than half an inch thick, like
sausage cakes, dip them in flour, put them into a saucepan of boiling
salted water and cook for three or four minutes. Take them up, drain
them from the water, dip in flour again, and brown them in hot butter in
a spider. Set them one side to keep hot. In another spider make a sauce.
Put in a heaping tablespoonful of flour, a generous heaping
tablespoonful of butter, and a heaping tablespoonful of chopped walnut
meats, let them all brown nicely together, then stir in a vegetable
stock that has been strained until the gravy is as thick as cream.


SPAGHETTINA CHOPS.

Spaghettina is finer than spaghetti, and for sale at Italian groceries.
Half a cup of milk, half a cup of spaghettina, broken into bits, three
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, one tablespoonful of butter, half a
tablespoonful of flour, and one egg. Put the spaghettina on in boiling
salted water, boil for three-quarters of an hour, drain well in a
colander. Make the sauce by melting the butter and stirring the flour
into it until smooth, then add the cheese and milk and the spaghettina.
Let it come to a boil and stir in quickly the beaten egg, let it
thicken, remove at once from the fire, turn it out in a deep plate, and
when cold form it into chops, dip them in beaten egg, then in bread
crumbs and fry in boiling fat. They are very nice served with a tomato
sauce, but good without it.


TOMATO CHOPS.

Measure three-quarters of a cup of tomatoes after the water has been
drained off, put in a saucepan over the fire and stir into it a cupful
of mashed potatoes, a heaping tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper
to taste, half a cup of grated bread crumbs. Mix thoroughly and add one
egg beaten light. Remove from the fire, turn into a deep plate, let it
get cold, then form in the shape of chops, dip in egg and roll in dried
bread or cracker crumbs and fry a nice brown in boiling fat. Arrange on
a platter and serve with tomato sauce, or place around a dish of stewed
tomatoes.


SAVORY FRIED BREAD.

Cut slices of stale home-made bread about half an inch thick, shape them
like chops, soak the slices in a rich, well seasoned vegetable stock
until nearly saturated with it--don't allow them to become too
soft--then dip in beaten egg mixed with a little milk and fry in butter
in a spider until a nice brown. Serve with tomato sauce, or around a
dish of stewed tomatoes.


MOCK FISH CHOPS.

Pare three good sized potatoes, cut fine and throw them into cold water
to prevent them from turning dark. When all are cut drain them from the
water and chop very fine--there must be two cupfuls. Have a cup of
boiling milk in a saucepan and put the potatoes into it, cook until
tender, but not soft, and be careful not to let them burn; when done add
two generous heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, two heaping
tablespoonfuls of French carrots, previously cooked in as little water
as possible, and chopped very fine, one heaping teaspoonful of green
pepper, one of parsley, one heaping teaspoonful of grated onion, a
heaping saltspoonful of powdered mace, a dash of cayenne pepper and salt
to taste. Measure two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes--after all the water
has been pressed from them--chop fine and add to it one whole egg and
one egg yolk beaten light, stir this into the potato mixture while on
the stove, remove at once from the fire, add two heaping tablespoonfuls
of cracker crumbs rolled fine, and two tablespoonfuls of fine Madeira or
sherry. Turnout to cool and then form into chops, roll in egg and
cracker crumbs and fry in boiling fat. Serve with cucumber salad.


FRICASSEE OF SPAGHETTINA.

Take a cupful of spaghettina, broken into small pieces, put in boiling
salted water and cook for three-quarters of an hour. Drain well, have a
cupful of cream sauce and stir the cooked spaghettina into it, let it
come to a boil, season with salt and pepper, and add the well beaten
yolk of an egg, stir well, remove at once, and turn into a hot vegetable
dish and serve.


MUSHROOMS EN COQUILLE.

Wash half a pound of nice, fresh mushrooms, peel them and cut off the
stems, cut the flaps into dice, and put the skins and stems in a
saucepan with a cup of water, and cook for ten minutes. While these are
cooking put a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider, when hot add
the mushroom dice and let them cook until tender, then add a
dessertspoonful of flour, and when it is cooked add the water the stems
were boiled in, and salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick
add a little more water. Stir in at the last a teaspoonful of finely
minced parsley, a few drops of lemon juice and the well-beaten yolk of
one egg, stir well, remove from the fire, fill the shells, sprinkle
bread crumbs over the tops and a little melted butter, put in the oven
for an instant to brown.


RAGOUT OF EGG PLANT.

Boil a small egg plant until tender. Peel it thinly and set aside to get
cold. Cut in slices an inch thick and cover the bottom of a baking dish
with them. Melt a generous tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan and
stir into it two heaping tablespoonfuls of fresh mushrooms, a heaping
teaspoonful of parsley, a heaping teaspoonful of onion, all chopped very
fine, season with salt and pepper and pour over the egg plant. When it
is time to put it in the oven sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and fine
breadcrumbs and dot with small lumps of butter, and bake until brown in
a quick oven. Serve in the dish in which it is baked with the following
sauce in a sauce boat.

SAUCE.--Boil the skins and stems of the mushrooms in a cup of water;
while they are cooking, brown together in a spider a slightly heaping
tablespoonful of butter, a slightly heaping tablespoonful of flour, and
a small slice of onion cut very fine. Strain the mushroom skins and
stems and add the water they were cooked in to the browned butter and
flour, and when the sauce is thick and smooth turn it into a saucepan
and add to it a heaping tablespoonful of mushrooms, one small cucumber
pickle and two large olives, all chopped very fine. Let all simmer
together for a few minutes, season to taste with salt and pepper. If the
sauce is too thick add a little water. It should be like thick cream.


PATTIES OF PUFF PASTE.

Roll out some puff paste an inch thick, cut with a patty-cutter as many
rounds as are needed, then with a smaller cutter stamp each round about
half an inch deep. Bake in a quick oven; when done lift the centers out
carefully with a knife, remove a little of the inside. When wanted heat
the patty shells and fill with spaghettina in tomato sauce, mushrooms or
vegetables in a cream or savory sauce, or the filling as given for
spinach border mould. A few truffles cut fine are a nice addition to
tomato sauce. Lay the little tops on and serve.


SAVORY RICE (a Mexican Dish).

Wash half a cup of rice, drain from the water. Put a heaping
tablespoonful of butter in a spider, when hot add a small leek or white
onion and the rice, fry until the rice is a golden brown--do not let it
get too dark. Have ready a vegetable stock, nearly fill the spider and
cook twenty minutes until the rice is perfectly dry. Every grain should
stand alone. Turn out on a platter and serve with tomato sauce.


RAGOUT OF ASPARAGUS WITH MOCK MEAT BALLS.

Scrape and wash a bunch of asparagus, cut in pieces about an inch long
as far as the stalks are very tender, put the remainder of the stalks
with an onion into a saucepan, cover with boiling water and let it cook
until tender--about half an hour. Then mash them in the water in which
they were boiled through a colander. Put over the fire again, and when
it comes to a boil throw in the points and cook until tender. While that
is cooking make some mock meat, as given in a previous recipe, form into
balls as large as a walnut. Cook them in salted boiling water for five
minutes, drain them from the water, also the asparagus points from the
stock, put them together in a saucepan to keep hot while making a gravy.
Melt a generous heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider, add to it
when it bubbles a large heaping tablespoonful of flour, stir well until
it becomes a dark, rich brown, taking care that it does not burn, add
the asparagus stock, season with salt and pepper--this gravy should be
like thick cream--turn it over the asparagus and meat balls, stir in a
good half tablespoonful of butter, let it come to a boil and serve on a
platter. Garnish with parsley.


CURRIED RICE CROQUETTES.

Put three-quarters of a cup of milk in a saucepan with butter the size
of an egg, let it come to a boil, and stir into it one large cup and a
half of rice that has been boiled in salted water twenty minutes. Add a
slightly heaping teaspoonful of curry powder, a few drops of onion juice
and salt to taste. When it comes to a boil add a beaten egg to it, stir
a minute and remove from the fire. Turn it out, let it cool, and then
form into cylinders and fry as usual.


MOCK FISH CROQUETTES.

Slice three medium sized potatoes, boil until tender, but not soft, chop
very fine an even teaspoonful of onion with three zepherettes or small
square crackers, then add the hot potatoes and chop all together, season
with a dash of cayenne pepper, a saltspoonful of mace, a little salt and
pepper. Make a sauce with a large heaping tablespoonful of butter, a
heaping teaspoonful of flour rubbed well together in a saucepan over the
fire; when smooth add three-quarters of a cup of rich hot milk, when it
boils add the potato mixture, let it get thoroughly hot and stir into it
a well-beaten egg, remove from the fire, turn it out to get cool. Form
into cylinders, dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs, fry in boiling fat,
and serve with either Hollandaise or tartar sauce.


WALNUT CROQUETTES.

Put half a pint of bread crumbs and a gill of milk in a double boiler,
place over the fire and stir until thick and smooth, add a pinch of
salt, three-quarters of a cup of chopped nuts and a tablespoonful of
sherry. When the mixture is hot stir into it the well-beaten yolks of
two eggs and remove from the fire at once. Set the mixture away to get
cold, then form in any shape preferred for croquettes; dip them in egg
and then in dried bread or cracker crumbs, fry in boiling fat and serve
with a sauce piquante.


RAGOUT OF MUSHROOMS.

Wash half a pound of fine, fresh mushrooms, skin, stem and cut them into
dice. Put the stems and skins in water to cover and stew them for twenty
minutes; strain and put the mushrooms into this broth with a generous
tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of finely chopped onion, season
with salt and pepper, cook until tender; when done add two well-beaten
yolks of eggs, stir briskly and remove at once from the fire, turn out
on a platter, sprinkle with a little very finely minced parsley and
serve very hot.


MOCK CHICKEN CROQUETTES.

Two cups of rye bread--home-made is the best--chopped fine, one cup of
chopped English walnuts. Mix together and chop again with a
tablespoonful of butter, an even tablespoonful of grated onion, a scant
teaspoonful of ground mace. Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a
saucepan with half a tablespoonful of flour and add gradually to it a
cupful of rich milk; when this comes to a boil add the other
ingredients, salt and pepper to taste, then stir in two well-beaten
eggs, remove from the fire and add a tablespoonful of lemon juice; turn
out on a platter to cool, form into cylinders, dip in egg and bread
crumbs, as usual, and fry in boiling fat.




Vegetables.


Vegetables should be cooked in as little water as possible; the better
way is to steam them. So much of the valuable salts are washed out by
boiling in too much water.

All vegetables left over can be warmed again, either in a cream sauce,
or put in a double boiler and steamed, adding a little more butter.

When pepper is used, it should always be white pepper, especially in
white sauces and soups.

Never salt vegetables until they are nearly cooked; it hardens them.

The water vegetables are boiled in may be utilized in making sauces and
soups; the best of the vegetables goes into it.

The water Jerusalem artichokes are boiled in becomes quite a thick jelly
when cold, and makes an excellent foundation for sauces.


TO BOIL POTATOES.

Select potatoes of uniform size, wash and pare thinly, cover with
boiling water and cook half an hour; when nearly done add salt. As soon
as done drain from the water and set the saucepan where the potatoes can
steam for a few minutes. They should be served immediately, and never
allowed to remain in the water a moment after they are cooked. Potatoes
are much better steamed with their skins on than boiled, as they then
retain all the potashes. When they are old they should be washed, pared
and covered with cold water, and allowed to stand for several hours
before either boiling or frying.


POTATOES BAKED.

Select them of uniform size, wash and scrub well, cut a thin slice from
each end to prevent their being soggy. They require nearly an hour to
bake in a moderate oven.


TO MASH POTATOES.

Boil the potatoes carefully, drain from the water, mash fine, and to
four good-sized potatoes add a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a
tablespoonful or two of cream or rich milk and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve at once. They must be freshly mashed and very hot to be eatable.
The mashed potatoes maybe squeezed through a vegetable ricer, when they
are called Potatoes à la Neige.


NEW POTATOES WITH CREAM SAUCE.

Select rather small potatoes of uniform size and boil. When done drain
off the water, set them back on the stove to keep hot while making a
cream sauce, then put them carefully in a vegetable dish, pour the sauce
over them and sprinkle with a little finely minced parsley.


BROILED POTATOES.

Take some cold boiled potatoes and cut them in rather thick slices
lengthwise, dust with white pepper and salt, dip each slice in melted
butter, broil over a clear fire until a nice brown. Serve with melted
butter and finely minced parsley poured over them.


POTATOES À LA CRÊME AU GRATIN.

Chop cold boiled potatoes, put them in a baking dish, pour over them a
cupful of white sauce nicely seasoned, sprinkle with a tablespoonful of
grated Parmesan cheese or Edam cheese grated, one tablespoonful of bread
crumbs, and dot all over with tiny bits of butter. Put in a quick oven
for a few minutes to brown. Do not leave it in too long, or it will
become dry.


STUFFED POTATOES.

Bake some medium-sized potatoes; when done cut in half lengthwise, scoop
out the inside, taking care not to break the skin. Mash the potato
smooth and fine with butter and a little milk, season with salt and
pepper to taste, heat thoroughly, fill the skins, brush the tops over
with melted butter, brown in the oven and serve.


POTATO FRICASSEE.

Put in a spider a generous tablespoonful of butter and a cup of milk,
when hot add some cold potatoes cut in dice, season with pepper, salt, a
few drops of onion juice. Let them get thoroughly hot, then add the
beaten yolks of two eggs, stir constantly until thick. Great care must
be taken not to let it cook too long, or the sauce will curdle. Pour
into a vegetable dish, sprinkle a little finely minced parsley over the
top and serve.


POTATOES À LA DUCHESSE.

Take cold mashed potatoes that are nicely seasoned with salt and pepper,
form into little round cakes, put them on a tin, glaze over with beaten
egg and brown in the oven. Arrange on a platter, garnish with parsley
and serve.


SARATOGA CHIPS.

Peel some medium-sized white potatoes, and slice them very thin. It is
better to have a potato slicer for these, if possible, as it cuts them
so quickly and perfectly. Wash the potatoes in one or two waters, then
cover with fresh water and lay a lump of ice on the top of them. Let
them stand an hour, if convenient, drain in a colander, wipe dry with a
towel, and fry in boiling fat--not too many at a time in the basket or
they will stick together, and will not brown. Have a quick fire, and fry
until brown and crisp, drain on paper, sprinkle with salt and serve.


FRENCH FRIED POTATOES.

Peel some potatoes and cut in finger lengths, not too thick, cover with
ice water, and if they are old it is better to let them stand two hours.
Drain, wipe dry, and fry in boiling fat as Saratoga chips--not too many
at a time. When they are a nice brown lift the basket from the fat,
sprinkle with salt, shake the grease from them and remove with a
skimming spoon, drain on paper and serve at once.


POTATOES À LA MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL.

Cut cold boiled potatoes in round slices, not too thick, put in a
saucepan with some melted butter, pepper and salt. When they are hot add
some lemon juice and a little minced parsley and serve.


POTATOES LYONNAISE.

Fry a little onion cut in thin slices in plenty of butter; when a
delicate brown add some cold boiled potatoes cut in slices of medium
thickness, mixing them with the onion by tossing them together rather
than stirring, as this breaks them. Cook until a nice color, drain them,
put in a dish and sprinkle a little minced parsley over them.


POTATOES À LA PARISIENNE.

Peel and wash some potatoes, scoop out into little balls with a potato
scoop, which is made for the purpose. Boil for five minutes, put in
melted butter in a saucepan until each potato is well covered with the
butter, turn them into a pan, and brown in the oven. Turn out on a dish
and sprinkle with minced parsley and a little salt.


POTATOES CREAMED AND BROWNED.

Take a pint of cold boiled potatoes, cut into dice of uniform size. Have
ready a pint of cream sauce, toss the potatoes in this, season with
salt and white pepper to taste, put in a baking dish, sprinkle with
dried bread crumbs and a tablespoonful of American Edam cheese. A few
drops of onion juice, if liked, may be added before putting the potatoes
into the dish. Set it in the oven a few minutes, until it becomes a
golden brown and serve. Do not let it stand in the oven long or it will
dry.


POTATO PUFF.

Two cupfuls of smoothly mashed boiled or baked potatoes, two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two well-beaten whites of eggs, a
cupful of sweet cream or rich milk. Stir the melted butter into the
potato, then add the eggs and cream, season with salt and pepper, turn
into a buttered baking dish, bake in a quick oven and serve in the dish
in which it is baked.


WHITE POTATO CROQUETTES.

Boil and mash very fine four medium sized potatoes. Put half a cup of
rich milk and a generous heaping tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan
over the fire. When the milk comes to a boil, stir in the mashed
potatoes, season with pepper and salt to taste, mix thoroughly and add
the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth, remove from the fire, turn
out on a plate to cool, then make up in small cylinders, dip in beaten
egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry a delicate brown in boiling fat.


POTATO PAPA (a Mexican Dish).

Wash, pare and boil one dozen small white potatoes, mash while hot and
add to them half a cup of raisins stoned and chopped very fine, twenty
large Queen olives stoned and chopped fine, one tablespoonful of parsley
finely minced, an even teaspoonful of sugar, and salt and pepper to
taste. Mix all well together, form into an oblong shape, leaving the
top rough. Brown a little butter in a spider, put the papa into it, and
after a few moments' frying scatter little lumps of butter over the top
and set in the oven to brown. Garnish with parsley and hard-boiled eggs
cut in quarters lengthwise.


SWEET POTATOES FRIED RAW.

Peel two or three medium-sized potatoes and cut in slices about a
quarter of an inch thick, fry in boiling fat--when they are a nice brown
they are done--drain on paper for a moment before serving.


COOKED SWEET POTATOES FRIED.

Take several sweet potatoes cut in slices lengthwise, not too thin. Dip
each slice in melted butter and then in brown sugar, and fry in a little
butter.


SWEET POTATOES MASHED AND BROWNED.

Boil three sweet potatoes of medium size until done. Peel and squeeze
through the patent vegetable strainer, add a heaping tablespoonful of
butter, salt and pepper to taste, and enough milk to make very soft. Put
in a baking dish, dot it over with tiny bits of butter and bake until
brown. Serve in the dish in which it is baked. If any is left over
remove the thin brown skin, make the potato into small, flat cakes and
brown on both sides in a little butter in a spider.


SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES.

Three medium-sized potatoes baked and mashed very fine and beaten to a
cream with one generous tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of
cream, one teaspoonful of sugar, a little salt, one teaspoonful of lemon
juice, a saltspoonful of cinnamon and one egg yolk beaten very light,
and add at the last the white of egg whipped to a stiff froth. Form into
cones or cylinders, dip in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fry in
boiling fat. Drain on kitchen paper, sift a little sugar over them and
serve at once.


BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

Pick off any leaves that may be discolored and wash well a quart of
Brussels sprouts, put into a saucepan with two quarts of boiling water
and a saltspoonful of soda. Boil rapidly until tender--about half an
hour--just before they are done add a tablespoonful of salt. Drain them
in a colander, and if it is not time to serve them stand the colander
over steam to keep them hot. Do not let them remain in the water. When
ready to serve put the sprouts in a vegetable dish and pour over them a
pint of rich cream sauce.


OKRA AND TOMATOES.

A quart of fresh or canned tomatoes--if fresh, skin in the usual
way--cut them in quarters and put over the fire, let them boil until a
great deal of the water has evaporated, then add a pint of fresh okra,
cut in slices, cook until tender, season with a generous heaping
tablespoonful of butter, and pepper and salt to taste.


BEETS.

Wash the beets carefully to avoid breaking the skin, and do not cut off
the fine roots, as this will bleed and spoil them. Put on in boiling
water and cook from an hour and a half to three hours. Test with a
wooden skewer. Cut in slices or dice and serve with melted butter,
pepper and salt. Winter beets should be soaked over night.


PURÉE OF PEAS.

When peas are old this is a very nice way to use them. Put a quart of
shelled peas over the fire in sufficient boiling water to cook them.
Boil until tender, drain from the water, press through a purée sieve,
season with salt and pepper to taste, and a good heaping tablespoonful
of butter, and if too dry a little milk or cream may be used.


PURÉE OF LIMA BEANS

may be prepared in the same way.


PURÉE OF CUCUMBERS.

Peel and slice the cucumbers and put them over the fire in as little
boiling water as will cook them; when tender drain from the water, press
through a purée sieve, season with salt and pepper and add a
tablespoonful of butter.


STUFFED CUCUMBERS.

Peel two large, fine cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, take out the
seeds. Scrape out carefully the soft part--with a small spoon--into a
saucepan. Peel and core a tart apple, chop fine with a small pickled
gherkin, take from this a good tablespoonful for the sauce and put one
side, then add the rest to the soft part of the cucumbers in the
saucepan. Let it simmer until tender, then add butter the size of an
egg, pepper and salt to taste, a few drops of onion juice, or the spoon
used for stirring the mixture may be rubbed with garlic, three
tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs, one egg beaten, stir all
together, and remove at once from the fire. Put the cucumbers in a
saucepan, cover with boiling water and cook gently until tender--about
ten or fifteen minutes; when nearly done add a tablespoonful of salt,
drain from the water, when cool enough stuff them with the dressing
already prepared and press into shape, brush with egg, sprinkle bread

pan and bake a delicate brown.

FOR THE SAUCE, take the tablespoonful of apple and pickle reserved from
the stuffing, and add a teaspoonful of capers, chop all together as fine
as possible, make a cream sauce and add this mixture to it on the fire
and heat thoroughly. Place the cucumbers carefully on a platter and pour
the sauce around them.


CUCUMBERS STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS.

Peel two large, firm cucumbers, and cut in half lengthwise; take out the
seeds. Take a quarter of a pound of fresh mushrooms, skin and stem them.
Chop the mushroom flaps very fine, put them in a spider with four
tablespoonfuls of melted butter and a very little water, cover and cook
until tender. Remove from the fire, stir in four heaping tablespoonfuls
of grated bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a few drops of onion
juice, and the yolk of one egg. Stuff the cucumbers with this dressing,
put the halves together, fasten with wooden toothpicks or tie with
string. Place in a small dish that will fit in the steamer, cover
closely, and steam until tender--about three-quarters of an hour--and
serve with a brown sauce made as follows:

THE SAUCE.--Put on the skins and stems of the mushrooms in boiling
water. Fry a few slices each of carrot, celery top, green pepper, onion
and turnip in butter, strain the water from the mushroom stems into this
and stew until all are tender, strain, add a generous tablespoonful of
butter and enough flour to thicken the sauce, and salt and pepper to
taste. Place the cucumbers in a shallow vegetable dish, remove the
strings and pour the sauce around them.


ESCALLOPED EGG PLANT.

Boil a small egg plant, cut it in half, take out the pulp, throwing away
the seeds and skin, chop the pulp fine and mix with it half a
teaspoonful of bread crumbs, one cup of cream or rich milk, butter the
size of an egg, an even teaspoonful of finely minced parsley, pepper and
salt to taste, and a few drops of onion juice. Beat all together, turn
into a baking dish, cover the top with dried bread crumbs and tiny bits
of butter and bake until brown. Serve in the dish in which it is baked.
If any is left over, cut in slices half an inch thick and fry in butter
for luncheon.


STUFFED EGG PLANT.

Take half a large egg plant, boil gently until tender, remove from the
fire, take out the pulp carefully so as not to break the shell, leaving
it about a quarter of an inch thick. Peel and stem a quarter of a pound
of fresh mushrooms, chop very fine, reserve a heaping tablespoonful of
this for the sauce, then add the pulp of the egg plant to the mushrooms
in the chopping bowl, and one heaping tablespoonful of currants, washed
and picked over, one even teaspoonful of grated onion, one even
teaspoonful of chopped green pepper, five heaping tablespoonfuls of
grated bread crumbs, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two
tablespoonfuls of rich cream. Mix all well together, fill the shell with
this mixture, press it into shape and bind carefully with string. Bake
twenty minutes, remove the string and serve on a platter with the sauce
poured around it.

THE SAUCE.--Put on the skins and stems of the mushrooms in a saucepan,
cover with boiling water, cook until tender, drain, and into this water
put the tablespoonful of reserved mushrooms, add salt and pepper to
taste, boil a few minutes, then add a heaping teaspoonful of flour
stirred into a heaping tablespoonful of butter, let all cook together
until thick, and pour around the egg plant.


GREEN CORN CAKES.

One quart of grated corn, one teacup of butter melted, four

griddle cakes and serve at once. These cakes are very good made of
canned corn. Pound the corn in a mortar and press through a sieve.


CORN PUDDING.

Four large ears of corn grated, or a can of corn prepared as for corn
cakes, one heaping tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of flour,
one teaspoonful of sugar, one whole egg and one yolk. Melt the butter
and stir into the corn, beat the eggs and add with one pint of milk, the
sugar and flour, and salt and pepper to taste. Bake in a shallow dish in
a moderate oven from twenty minutes to half an hour. If it bakes too
long, it becomes watery.


MOCK OYSTERS OF GREEN CORN.

A pint of grated corn, a cup of flour, one egg, two ounces of butter,
three tablespoonfuls of milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and
drop from a spoon in oblong cakes--to look as much like oysters as
possible--into hot butter, fry brown on both sides. Serve on a platter
and garnish with parsley. These may also be made of canned corn by
pressing it through a colander with a potato masher to separate the
hulls from it.


CORN BOILED ON THE COB.

Husk the corn and remove the silk, put in a kettle, and cover with
boiling water. If the corn is young, it will cook in from five to ten
minutes, as it is only necessary to set the milk. It should be served at
once in a folded napkin.


CURRY OF CORN.

A can of corn, one good tart cooking apple, one tomato, a teaspoonful of
finely chopped green pepper, a teaspoonful of grated onion, a
teaspoonful of curry powder, a tablespoonful of chopped Brazil or
English walnuts, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and salt and pepper to
taste. Put the butter in a spider, when it bubbles add the apple cut in
dice and onion, fry brown, then stir in the curry powder, the chopped
pepper and tomato and nuts, let all simmer together for a few minutes,
then add the corn, and cook gently for twenty minutes. If it is too
thick a little water must be added. Serve in a shallow vegetable dish or
on a platter. Fresh corn may be used. Boil and then cut from the cob,
cook the cobs in the water the corn was boiled in long enough to extract
all the good from them, and use this broth for the curry.


CROQUETTES OF SALSIFY AND CELERIAC.

Two roots of salsify and one large celeriac. Wash and scrape them well.
Cut in pieces and cover with vinegar and water and let them stand one
hour--this will prevent them from turning dark. Pour off the vinegar and
water and nearly cover them with boiling water, cook until very tender,
mash fine and smooth, season with pepper and salt, and a few drops of
onion juice, put in a saucepan over the fire, and add a tablespoonful of
butter, two tablespoonfuls of milk, and just before removing from the
fire add a tablespoonful of cream and one egg, stir well, turn out into
a bowl and set aside to cool. When cold make into croquettes, dip in egg
and cracker crumbs and fry in a basket in boiling oil.


INDIAN CURRY OF VEGETABLES.

Equal quantities of cauliflower and potatoes, raw. The cauliflower cut
into flowerettes and the potatoes into dice. Put them into a spider
with a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a rounded teaspoonful of curry
powder, and let them simmer for a few minutes without taking color. Then
add two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes, an even teaspoonful of grated onion
and one of chopped green pepper, fill up the spider with boiling water,
and set it back on the stove where it will stew gently until the
vegetables are tender and the water has been reduced to one-third the
quantity. It should be as thick as ordinary gravy; if not, add a scant
teaspoonful of flour. Just before it is done stir in a heaping
tablespoonful of butter. Turn it into a shallow vegetable dish and serve
very hot. The spider should be kept covered while the curry is cooking.
It is very good without the green pepper. This may be warmed over, and
is better the second day than the first.


KOHLRABI.

Peel them, cut in slices and pour on just enough boiling water to cook
them. Cook until tender. When nearly done add salt. Make a cream sauce,
season with white pepper, salt and a little grated nutmeg, if liked,
toss them in this sauce, let it boil up once and serve very hot.


MARROWFAT BEANS BAKED.

Pick over carefully and wash one quart of beans, soak in water over
night. In the morning drain, add fresh cold water and bring to a boil,
drain again, and turn them into a four-quart stone jar, put in a
generous cup of butter, two large tablespoonfuls of Porto Rico molasses,
two tablespoonfuls of salt, less than a teaspoonful of pepper, and fill
the jar with boiling water. Put in the oven, covering the jar with a tin
cover. It must be cooked in a slow oven eight or nine hours--the water
ought to last until the beans are perfectly cooked, and when done a
good gravy left, about a third of the depth of the beans in the jar.
Beans cooked in this way are very nutritious and easily digested. Keep
them covered for two or three hours while cooking. Serve with Chili
sauce.

until the water becomes thick like cream.


EMPARADAS (a Mexican Recipe).

Take some beans cooked as in Mexican Beans No. 1 and mash them to a

inch--cut this into rounds with a large patty cutter, put a spoonful of
the bean purée on the half of each round, wet the edges of the pastry,
cover, press the edges together, making a half moon, brush them over
with beaten egg and bake in a hot oven, or they may be fried in boiling
oil or fat until a delicate brown.

oil over each mushroom, let them stand one hour. Broil on a gridiron
over a nice clear fire. Place on a dish and serve with the following
sauce: Prepare the stock as before by boiling the stems and skins in
water and then straining. Mince two or three mushrooms fine, add to the
stock, with a teaspoonful of minced parsley, a few drops of onion juice,
a small lump of butter, cook for fifteen minutes, then add a cupful of

gently until nearly dry, then add water almost to cover them, salt and
pepper to taste, and let them cook fifteen minutes. Take out the bag of
onion, etc., and thicken with one egg yolk well beaten, and a small
cupful of cream. Have some slices of toast on a platter, buttered and

FRENCH CARROTS AND PEAS.

Take a pint of young peas and two bunches of French carrots, cut in
slices or fancy shapes (stars or clover leaves), cook each vegetable by
itself in as little water as will cook them. When they are both tender
put them together into a saucepan, add a heaping tablespoonful of butter
and half a tablespoonful of flour rubbed together, and if there is not
enough water left, add enough to make a gravy. Canned instead of fresh
peas may be used; drain the water from the peas and stew the carrots in
it, and follow the recipe as above.


SPINACH PUDDING.

Make a sauce of one ounce and a half of butter, one ounce of flour, a
scant half cup of rich milk, half a teaspoonful of sugar, a grating of
nutmeg, if liked, and salt and pepper to taste. When this comes to a
boil, add an even cupful of spinach that has been cooked and finely
chopped, and from which the water has been well pressed out. Remove from
the stove, and stir into it two beaten eggs. Grease a mould, sprinkle it
with dried and sifted bread crumbs, turn the pudding into this, set the
mould in a pan of hot water, put in the oven, cover it to prevent
browning and bake nearly three-quarters of an hour. Turn out on a
platter, have ready a cream sauce to pour around the pudding, garnish

three-quarters of a cup of cooked and finely chopped spinach, beat well
and remove from the fire. When cold add two eggs, one at a time, season
with salt and pepper to taste and half a saltspoonful of powdered mace.
Have a saucepan of boiling water, slightly salted, on the stove; dip a
tablespoon in cold water, and then take up enough of the spinach mixture
to make an oblong cake, in shape like an egg cut in half lengthwise,
then dip the spoon in the boiling water and let the cake float off. Use
all the mixture in this way. The balls will cook in four or five
minutes, and they must not boil too fast or they will break. Let them
drain in a colander while making a cream sauce, and when the sauce is
made put the balls into it and let them come to a boil, turn out on a
platter and garnish with parsley.

moisture has evaporated. Then serve.


CAULIFLOWER WITH DRAWN BUTTER.

Select a nice white cauliflower, take off all the leaves, and cut enough
of the stem off to allow it to stand well in the dish it is to be served
in. Put it into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and when it is
nearly done add salt, as cooking it long with salt turns it brown. The
usual time to cook a cauliflower is about twenty minutes. Try it with a
fork, and if it is tender remove carefully from the water, let it drain
in a colander while preparing a drawn butter. Then put into a hot
vegetable dish, pour the sauce over and serve.

and scrape them. Cut off a slice from the top of each to make a cover,
then with an apple corer remove the inside, taking care not to pierce
the root, leave a shell a quarter of an inch thick. Fill each with the
dressing, leaving fully half an inch at the top for it to swell. Place
the cover on each, tie well the roots to prevent breaking in the
cooking, stand them in a saucepan with water to reach not quite to the
top of the roots, and put in all the celeriac removed from the roots,
boil gently until tender--about an hour--adding boiling water from time
to time as it evaporates. When they are tender take them out of the
water and put them aside, keeping them hot. Strain the water they were
boiled in, form what is left from the stuffing into small cylinders,
boil five minutes in the strained stock, take them out and put with the
roots to keep warm. Then take a generous tablespoonful of butter, an
even tablespoonful of flour, brown them together in a spider, add two
heaping tablespoonfuls of chopped walnuts and let them brown a little,
then stir in gradually the stock the roots were boiled in and cook until
it thickens. Arrange the roots in the center of the platter, the
cylinders around them and pour the sauce over all. Garnish with parsley,
putting a tiny sprig of celery leaves in the top of each root.


SPRING CABBAGE STEWED.

Cut the cabbage very small, throw into a saucepan, cover with boiling
water, when nearly done add salt. Cook until tender, drain well in a
colander. Make a rich cream sauce--it must be quite thick, as the
cabbage will thin it--add a saltspoonful of mace, then the cabbage, let
it come to a boil and serve.


SPRING CABBAGE WITH CREAM SAUCE.

Boil a young cabbage or part of one until perfectly tender, when done
drain all the water from it in a colander, place in a vegetable dish and
pour over it a rich cream sauce.


SPRING TURNIPS IN CREAM SAUCE.

Pare and cut into dice some young turnips, cook them tender in as little
water as possible, salt when nearly done. Have ready a cream sauce,
nicely seasoned, and after draining the turnips put them into the sauce,
let them come to the boiling point and remove immediately from the fire,
turn them into the serving dish, sprinkle a little finely chopped
parsley over the top and serve. A tiny grain of mace added to the sauce
is an improvement, but it must be used with great care.


WHITE BREAD BALLS.

Take four ounces of bread from which the crust has been removed, cut it
into dice. Put half a cup of milk in a saucepan with two ounces of
butter and a teaspoonful of sugar, let it come to a boil, then stir in
the bread and continue stirring until it no longer cleaves to the pan,
remove from the fire. When cool stir into it two eggs, one at a time,
and a little salt. Cook in boiling water, as described for other balls,
and serve in a cream sauce as a vegetable. (See spinach balls, page 74.)


NOODLES.

Beat the yolks of two eggs with a little salt and one tablespoonful of
cold water and stir in enough flour to make a very stiff dough. Roll out
as thin as paper and then roll it up; let it stand for an hour, and then
cut fine with a sharp knife. These will keep any length of time, and can
be used in soups, as a vegetable or in a pudding.


NOODLES À LA FERRARI.

Prepare the noodles as above, and cook in boiling salted-water from
twenty to twenty-five minutes. Drain well. Have ready a tomato sauce,
stir the noodles into it, turn into a baking dish, sprinkle well with
grated Parmesan cheese and brown in a quick oven.


GNOCCHI À LA ROMAINE.

Put two ounces of butter in a saucepan over the fire with two
tablespoonfuls of milk. When this comes to a boil stir in four ounces of
flour; then add a cup of milk, let it cook, stirring all the time until
it no longer adheres to the pan, remove from the fire, let it cool and
then beat in three eggs, one at a time, two heaping tablespoonfuls of
grated Parmesan cheese, a saltspoonful of mace and a dash of salt. Set
it away to get cold, make it into small balls. Have a large saucepan of
boiling, salted water on the stove, drop the balls into it and let them
boil five minutes, take them out with a skimmer and drain well. Have
ready a cream sauce, put the balls in this, and when they are hot turn
into a baking dish, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake until brown
in a quick oven.




Salads.


MAYONNAISE DRESSING.

One-half teaspoonful of mustard, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, one
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper; then add two raw egg
yolks, beat well and stir in a teaspoonful of strong vinegar; add very
carefully, drop by drop, a scant three-quarters of a cup of best olive
oil, and as it thickens half a teaspoonful of vinegar. This recipe never
fails, if the directions are carefully followed. The eggs and oil should
be kept in the refrigerator and be ice cold. Lemon juice may be used,
instead of vinegar, if preferred.


CREAM SALAD DRESSING.

One-quarter of a cup of strong cider vinegar, one cup and a quarter of
water, one-half cup of butter, one teaspoonful of mustard, one
teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful, slightly heaping, of corn
starch, one teaspoonful of sugar, a dash of cayenne pepper and the yolks
of four eggs. Put the vinegar and water in a saucepan and when it boils
add the butter. Beat the yolks of eggs and the other ingredients
together with an egg-beater, making it quite foamy and light; pour the
boiling vinegar and water upon this mixture, which will partially
thicken. The bowl in which it is mixed should be placed in a pan of hot
water on the stove, beating it all the time with the egg-beater. Just
before it reaches the boiling point remove and turn it out into a cold
bowl, beating hard for a few minutes. When perfectly cold pour it into a
glass jar, fasten down the top and keep in refrigerator.


FRENCH DRESSING.

One tablespoonful of vinegar, three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a
saltspoonful of salt and one of white pepper, and a few drops of any
good sauce. Lettuce should be well washed in very cold water, leaf by
leaf, and drained in a basket, which comes for the purpose, then placed
on the ice, and at serving time put into the salad bowl. Lettuce should
never be cut with a knife, but torn with a fork and spoon, and it should
not be allowed to stand after the dressing is poured over it.


TOMATO ICE SALAD.

Put a quart can of tomatoes in a saucepan over the fire with half an
onion, a slice of green pepper, if convenient, three cloves, two bay
leaves, a sprig of parsley, a teaspoonful of sugar, and pepper and salt
to taste. Cook until the onion is tender--about ten minutes--remove from
the fire, press through a sieve fine enough to retain the seeds. When
cold freeze as water-ice and mould--a melon mould is very pretty for
it--pack in salt and ice in the usual way; turn it out in a nest of
crisp young lettuce and serve with a mayonnaise dressing in a sauceboat.


[2]TOMATO JELLY.

One can of tomatoes put on to heat in a granite or porcelain-lined
saucepan with a large slice of onion, one clove, two bay leaves, a
teaspoonful of chopped green pepper, salt to taste and a little sugar.
Soak half a box of gelatine in a little water for half an hour, and
after the tomatoes have simmered fifteen minutes let them come to a boil
and pour over the gelatine to dissolve it; strain through a very fine
sieve into a bowl, let it get perfectly cold, and when it begins to
thicken stir well and turn into an earthenware mould. It looks prettier
in a round one. Set on ice. Serve the jelly on a round dish in a bed of
fresh, crisp young lettuce leaves, and place a spoonful of tender,
finely-cut celery in each leaf, and pour mayonnaise around it. The jelly
is better made the day before it is needed.

  [2] We have as yet in this country no substitute for animal gelatine.
  I have experimented with carrageen or Irish moss and the Sea-moss
  Farine preparation, and find them unsatisfactory. It is impossible to
  make a clear jelly with them, and by soaking in water to destroy the
  sea flavor, the solidifying property is lost. In England they have a
  vegetable gelatine (Agar Agar) which makes, I am told, a clear,
  sparkling jelly, and is said not to be expensive. I trust that before
  many months it may be obtainable here. I have ventured, therefore, to
  give a few recipes where gelatine is used, knowing that there will be
  something to replace it. Groult's tapioca and potato flour are said to
  be unadulterated, and with fresh fruit juices make nice and wholesome
  desserts, especially for children. These preparations are made in
  France, and put up in half-pound packages, and sold by all of our
  leading grocers.


SPAGHETTINA AND CELERY SALAD.

Take some cold boiled spaghettina, chop--not too fine--and cover with a
French dressing, and let it stand on the ice until serving time. Have an
equal quantity of fresh, crisp celery cut fine, mix with the
spaghettina, cover with a mayonnaise dressing and garnish with tender
lettuce leaves.


SALAD OF FAIRY RINGS AND PUFF BALL MUSHROOMS.

Have both very fresh; cook the fairy rings until tender, set aside to
get cold, then put on the ice. Take an equal quantity of puff ball raw,
chop fine, mix with the rings, turn into a nest of tender young lettuce,
cover with a mayonnaise dressing and serve.


SALAD OF FRESH FRUIT.

Peel and cut into dice enough fruit, peaches, tart plums, orange and
banana to fill a cup and a cupful of crisp celery cut fine; have both
ice cold; at serving time mix and cover with a cream dressing and
garnish with celery tops.


[3]CUCUMBER JELLY.

Half a box of gelatine soaked for an hour in half a cup of cold water.
Remove the seeds from a small green pepper, peel and cut into slices
two large, fine, fresh cucumbers, or three small ones and a small white
onion. Put in a saucepan, add a bay leaf and a bouquet of parsley, cover
with boiling water and cook until tender; remove the parsley and bay
leaf, add a saltspoonful of sugar, salt to taste--more than a
teaspoonful will be required--and press through a fine sieve. There
should be, when strained, two cups and a half. Pour it over the soaked
gelatine--if it is not hot enough to dissolve the gelatine place the
saucepan over the fire for a moment--then run it through the same sieve
again; set aside in a bowl to cool. When perfectly cold and beginning to
congeal, stir it well and pour into a pretty, round mould; set it on ice
until ready to serve. Turn it out on a plate and arrange fresh, crisp,
young lettuce leaves around it, into each of which put a spoonful of
mayonnaise or cream dressing.

  [3] This jelly may be colored a delicate green by using extract of
  spinach (see recipe, page 164). Its appearance is much improved
  thereby.


WALNUT AND CELERY SALAD.

Three cupfuls of fresh, crisp celery cut fine and two cupfuls of
walnuts, carefully shelled that they may be as little broken as
possible. Put the walnuts in a saucepan with a small onion sliced, a bay
leaf, a clove and twelve pepper corns, cover with boiling water, let
them cook for ten or fifteen minutes, remove from the fire, drain and
throw the nuts into cold water, remove the skins and let them get cold;
then set on the ice until it is time to serve. Mix them with the celery,
add mayonnaise or cream dressing, put on a dish or in a salad bowl,
garnish with the tender green celery leaves and serve.


PINEAPPLE AND CELERY SALAD.

Equal parts of celery and shredded pineapple. Have the celery of the
very tenderest, using only the best of the heads. Select a perfectly
ripe, fresh pineapple, pare it, removing the eyes carefully, and shred
the fruit with a silver fork and cut into small pieces with a silver
fruit knife; put the celery, cut fine, and the shredded pineapple, each
by itself on the ice, that they may be very cold. When it is time to
serve the salad, mix them together, put on the salad dish, cover with
mayonnaise dressing, garnish with the green celery leaves and serve at
once.


FRUIT SALAD.

Equal quantities of grape fruit or oranges, bananas, apples and celery.
Peel the grape fruit or oranges, carefully removing all the bitter white
skin, cut the pulp, the bananas and apples into small dice and the
celery fine as for other salads; put the orange and apple together; the
latter will absorb the juice of the orange. Set all on ice;--these fruit
salads must be ice cold. When it is time to serve, mix the fruit and
celery together, put into a salad bowl, cover with the cream dressing
into which has been stirred a third as much whipped cream as there is
dressing, and add a little more salt to it in mixing. Serve in a bed of
tender lettuce leaves.


POTATO SALAD.

Prepare equal parts of cold boiled potatoes and fresh, crisp celery, cut
in small pieces which will look attractive when mixed with the dressing;
cut in dice four cold, hard boiled eggs, and mix them in lightly with
the potato and celery when adding the dressing. Use mayonnaise or cream
dressing with this salad, garnish with dainty celery tops and serve.


SALAD OF TOMATOES STUFFED WITH CELERY.

Select nice, smooth, firm tomatoes, one for each person; blanch them in
the usual way, cut a slice from the stem end and remove the core and
some of the seeds; set on the ice to get cold. Prepare some celery,
shredding it fine and using only the very tender part; mix it with
mayonnaise dressing, stuff the tomatoes, allowing the celery to come
above the top, serve each in a leaf or two of crisp lettuce and pour
some mayonnaise around them. Salads should be ice cold.


CELERIAC AND LETTUCE SALAD.

Boil two or three celery roots in water with a little salt until tender;
drain and let them get cold. Cut them in thin slices, make a nest of
crisp lettuce and put the celery slices in the center. Serve with a
French dressing.


RAW JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AND LETTUCE SALAD.

Wash and peel the artichokes, cut in very thin slices and put into an
earthen bowl with vinegar and water with a lump of ice in it. The
vinegar will prevent them from turning dark. When ready to serve, place
in the center of nice, fresh lettuce and serve with a French dressing.


SALAD À LA MACÉDOINE.

Take several kinds of cold boiled vegetables in equal quantities, such
as green peas, string beans, flowerettes of cauliflower, asparagus
points, a small potato and a French carrot cut in small dice, and a
little green pepper if liked; mix together and serve in a nest of fresh,
crisp lettuce with a French dressing, or mayonnaise, if preferred.


ASPARAGUS SALAD.

Select very tender asparagus, cut off all the woody part and boil until
tender, set aside to get cold, and then put on ice until serving time;
arrange nicely on a platter or individual plates and serve with either
mayonnaise or French dressing.


CUCUMBER SALAD.

Peel and cut in very thin slices, lay in a bowl, cover with water,
sprinkle a little salt over them and put a lump of ice on top, let them
remain until serving time, drain off the water and serve in a glass
dish with a French dressing. They should be very cold and crisp. A
little green pepper, chopped very fine, is an addition; also to rub the
spoon used in mixing with a clove of garlic gives a piquancy to the
salad.


COLD SLAW.

Select a firm cabbage and shave very fine on a cutter that comes for
this purpose. Use the cream dressing or French dressing with a little
dry mustard added.


TOMATO SALAD.

The tomatoes should be blanched in the usual way, and either sliced or
cut in dice or served whole; or they may be cut in quarters, not quite
separating them, and arranged in a bed of lettuce with a spoonful of
mayonnaise on top of each tomato and the lettuce garnished with the
same.


ENDIVE

is excellent with French dressing.


EGG SALAD.

Boil three eggs hard, cut in half lengthwise, remove the yolks and mash
fine. Mix together in a saucepan the third of a teaspoonful each of dry
mustard, salt and white pepper, a saltspoonful of curry powder, a few
drops of onion juice, a teaspoonful of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of
egg well beaten, two teaspoonfuls of olive oil and a tablespoonful of
rich cream. Put the ingredients together in the order in which they are
named, beat well, set the bowl over the steam of the kettle and stir
constantly until thick and creamy; remove and stir in the mashed egg
yolks, a little at a time, and set on the ice to get very cold. To
serve, fill the whites of egg, dividing the mixture among them, put each
half egg on two or three leaves of tender lettuce, with mayonnaise
dressing around them.




Desserts.


APPLE BETTY.

Two cups of tart cooking apples, chopped, a cup and a half of stale
bread crumbs--bakers' bread is the best; four heaping tablespoonfuls of
sugar, one generous tablespoonful of butter, and the grated rind of one
lemon. Butter a pudding dish, divide the ingredients into four layers,
beginning with apples and finishing with bread crumbs. Sprinkle the
sugar and lemon over the apples and cut the butter into tiny lumps and
scatter over the crumbs. Bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate
oven. Serve with cream or hard sauce.


APPLE CHARLOTTE.

Pare, core and quarter eight or nine good cooking apples, put them into
a double boiler with two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a cup of sugar,
the juice and grated rind of a lemon; cook until tender. Take a plain
mould that holds three pints, butter it well, line the bottom and sides
with very thin slices of home-made bread. Remove the crust, dip each
slice in melted butter, fit them evenly together in the mould, fill with
the apples, cover with the bread, dredge it with sugar and bake
three-quarters of an hour in a quick oven. Have a hot platter, lay it
over the top of the charlotte, turn it over, and lift off the mould.
Serve hot with or without sauce or cream.


APPLE CROQUETTES.

Peel, core and quarter four good-sized cooking apples, cut in thin
slices and put them in a granite ware saucepan over the fire with a
small tablespoonful of butter, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar, the
grated rind of half a lemon and a saltspoonful of cinnamon; cover
tightly and cook until tender, taking care that it does not burn. When
done add an even tablespoonful of Groult's potato flour, mixed with a
very little water, then stir in one beaten egg, and remove from the
fire. Turn into a deep plate to get cold, form in cylinders, dip in egg
and dried bread crumbs and fry in boiling fat. Sift powdered sugar over
them and serve hot, with or without cream.


APPLES STEWED WHOLE.

Take some nice, tart cooking apples, pare and put them into a saucepan
with the juice of two lemons and the rind of one; cover with water, cook
slowly until they can be pierced with a straw, take them from the water
with a draining spoon. Make a syrup, allowing half a pound of sugar to a
pound of fruit, use as much of the water the apples were cooked in as
will dissolve the sugar; when it comes to a boil add the apples and cook
until clear. Take the apples out, core them and fill with a fruit jelly,
if liked, boil down the syrup and pour over the fruit. Serve very cold
with whipped or plain cream. Bartlett pears may be cooked in the same
manner, serving them whole.


APPLE SOUFFLÉ.

Seven tart, juicy apples, pared and cored, and cut fine. Put them over
the fire in a double boiler without any water, steam until tender, then
stir into them two tablespoonfuls of butter and one cup of sugar, remove
from the fire, and turn it into a bowl to cool. When it is cold beat in
the yolks of four eggs, whipped very light, a little grated lemon peel,
and then add alternately the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff
froth, and a cup of stale bread crumbs. Beat hard for a few moments and
turn into a buttered pudding dish and bake in a moderate oven about one
hour. Cover it while baking until ten or fifteen minutes before it is
done, so that it will not form a hard crust and become dry. Serve warm
in the dish in which it is baked.


APPLE CUSTARD.--No. 1.

Grate some good, tart cooking apples--enough to measure one quart. Beat
a generous tablespoonful of butter and seven tablespoonfuls of sugar to
a cream, add to this four egg yolks beaten light, then the apples and
the grated rind of a lemon, and lastly the whites of four eggs beaten to
a stiff froth. It can be baked in puff paste or without. Serve cold.


APPLE CUSTARD.--No. 2.

Pare, core and quarter half a dozen fine, large cooking apples, put them
in a double boiler with the grated rind of half a large lemon, cook
until tender, and press through a sieve; there must be three-quarters of
a pint of the purée. Add an ounce and a half of granulated sugar and set
it away to get cold. Then beat three eggs very light and stir gradually
into a pint of rich milk alternately with the apple purée, add a little
cinnamon, pour it into a pudding dish and bake about twenty minutes.
Serve cold with a little cinnamon and sugar sifted over it.


BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS.

Sift a pint of flour with a teaspoonful of baking powder and half a
teaspoonful of salt. Put a quarter of a pint of butter into it and chop
it fine with a knife; mix it well--do not use the hands; then add milk
enough to moisten it, about a quarter of a pint. Dust a pastry board
with flour, take the dough from the bowl, roll lightly into a sheet
about an eighth of an inch thick, cut into squares large enough to hold
an apple. Pare and core medium sized cooking apples, fill with sugar
and a little cinnamon, put in the middle of the square and draw the
corners up over the apples, moistening them with a little white of egg
or water to make them stick. Brush over the dumplings with beaten egg
and bake in a good oven. The time will depend upon the apples--about
half an hour. Serve with cream.


APPLE FLOAT.

Have a pint of apple purée, made from nice tart apples, sweetened to
taste and flavored with the grated rind of lemon and cinnamon, or nutmeg
if preferred. Set it on the ice that it may be very cold, beat the
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add to the purée of apples, and
serve with cream.


APPLES FRIED.

Wash and wipe some tart cooking apples, cut in slices a quarter of an
inch thick, core and fry them in butter until tender and brown, dredge
them with sugar and serve hot.


APPLE MARMALADE.

Two pounds of tart cooking apples, one pound of sugar, one pint of
water, one lemon and some blanched almonds. Stir the sugar and water
together and boil it until it strings from the spoon, then add the
apples pared and cored and cut in small pieces, cook until very thick,
flavor with the juice and grated peel of a small lemon. Turn into a wet
mould, when cold set on the ice. Turn out on a glass dish, stick it
thickly over with the blanched almonds, garnish with whipped cream and
serve with cream.


APPLE MERINGUE.

Put a pint of apple sauce, made of tart cooking apples, slightly
sweetened, into a pudding dish. Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff
froth and stir into it a cup and a quarter of sugar, flavor with a very
little extract of lemon--a few drops only--and spread over the apple
sauce, and bake twenty or twenty-five minutes. Make a custard of the
four egg yolks and a pint of milk, sweeten to taste and flavor with
vanilla. Serve the meringue very cold in the dish in which it is baked,
with the custard as a sauce in a sauceboat or glass pitcher.


APPLE PUDDING.--No. 1.

Take some tart cooking apples, pare, core and slice them and lay in cold
water for a few minutes to prevent them from turning dark. Put the
apples in a porcelain lined or granite saucepan and add water as deep as
the apples, but not to cover them. Cover the saucepan tightly and let
the apples cook until tender, then mash well, add sugar, grated lemon
peel and cinnamon to taste. Put it back on the stove, and when it comes
to a boil add a tablespoonful of potato flour mixed with a little cold
water, stir well and let it cook for a few minutes. Turn it into a mould
and serve the next day with cream.


APPLE PUDDING.--No. 2.

Prepare the apples as for Apple Pudding, No. 1. When tender mash through
a colander, and put the purée back on the stove. When it boils stir in a
very heaping tablespoonful of potato flour mixed with a little cold
water, and let it cook for a few minutes. Remove from the fire, stir in
a wine glass of sherry. Turn into a mould, set it on the ice until the
next day and serve with cream.


APPLES STEWED IN BUTTER.

Take half a dozen good, tart cooking apples--greenings or Newtown
pippins; peel, cut in slices about a quarter of an inch thick and core
them. Melt an ounce of butter in a spider, and lay in the slices of
apples with a quarter of a pound of granulated sugar and the juice of a
lemon, stew gently over a moderate fire. When done arrange them nicely
on a dish, melt a generous tablespoonful of currant jelly in the spider,
and when ready to serve mix with it half a glass of Madeira or sherry;
pour over the apples and serve.


TO STEAM APPLES.

Pare and core some good cooking apples, place them in an earthen or
granite ware dish that fits in a steamer. Have water boiling in the
steamer, set the dish over it, stretch a towel over the top, put on the
cover and fold the ends of the towel over it. Steam the apples until
tender--about twenty minutes. Take the apples out, measure the juice in
the pan and add to it an equal quantity of sugar, flavor with a little
lemon juice, cook until thick, put the apples in a glass dish and pour
the syrup over them. It will be a jelly when cold. Serve with cream.


SCALLOPED APPLES.

Pare, core and cut in slices some good, tart cooking apples, put a layer
in a baking dish with sugar, cinnamon and a grating of lemon rind, dot
with tiny lumps of butter, then another layer of apples, sugar, etc.,
and so on until the dish is full. Add a very little water and the juice
of a lemon, and use a little more sugar and butter on top than on the
other layers. Bake until the apples are thoroughly cooked. Cover until
nearly done, when the cover should be removed to allow them to brown.
Serve hot with cream or hard sauce.


BANANA FRITTERS.

Half a pint of sweet milk, a scant half pint of flour, two rounded
teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a small pinch of salt, stir all
together; this should make a batter as thick as that of cake. Roll the
pieces of fruit in it with a fork, and drop quickly into boiling fat.
The batter should be prepared just as it is wanted and not allowed to
stand. Cut three medium-sized bananas into three pieces each and divide
each slice lengthwise so that the fruit will be thin enough to cook
thoroughly while the batter is browning. This recipe will make eighteen
small fritters. Put them on a hot platter--do not pile up--and serve
immediately with a fruit sauce.


BAVARIAN CHERRY CAKE.

Half a pound of fine, juicy black cherries, five tablespoonfuls of fine
bread crumbs, five tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, five eggs and one
ounce of sweet chocolate grated. Put the grated chocolate in a mixing
bowl, break an egg into it and add one tablespoonful of bread crumbs and
one of sugar, beat light and break another egg into it, adding another
tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar. Then separate the three
remaining eggs, the yolks from the whites, adding one yolk at a time
alternately with bread crumbs and sugar until all are used. Add the
cherries. Beat the three whites of eggs to a stiff froth and fold it in
lightly. Butter thick a cake mould, sift dried bread crumbs over it,
turn the cake into it and bake about three-quarters of an hour in a
moderate oven. Test it as other cake. In Bavaria it is served cold, but
I think it would also be nice hot with fruit sauce.


CRANBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM.

Stew one quart of cranberries; while hot rub through a sieve; measure
out half a pint, and add to it a half cup of granulated sugar. Have a
quarter of a box of gelatine soaked in a quarter of a cup of water one
hour, set the bowl over steam entirely to dissolve the gelatine, then
add the cranberries. Turn it into an earthenware bowl, set in a pan of
ice water and beat until it is perfectly cold and begins to thicken,
then add half a cup of rich milk and beat again, and at the last add
half a cup of whipped cream. Beat it thoroughly and turn it into a mould
and set on the ice to congeal. Serve with cream. Do not use a tin mould
for cranberries.


A MOULD OF FRESH FRUIT.

Take enough fresh, ripe currants and raspberries to make half a cupful
of juice of each, and press through a sieve fine enough to retain the
seeds; or the fruit may be strained and squeezed through cheese cloth.
Take also enough ripe cherries to make a cupful of juice and mix all
together. Put a quart of boiling water in a saucepan over the fire with
four ounces of sugar and two ounces of almonds blanched and cut fine.
Mix five ounces of arrowroot or the same quantity of potato flour with
the cold fruit juices, stir it into the boiling water and let it boil
about five minutes, turn it into a wet mould, and when cold set on the
ice. This should be made the day before it is to be served. Serve with

cup more bread crumbs.


FRIED BREAD.

Sweeten a pint of milk, flavor with cinnamon or nutmeg to taste. Have

and a lump of butter the size of a walnut. Let it boil for a few
moments, remove from the fire and beat very light four eggs, strain the
chocolate gradually over them, stirring all the time, add a little salt,
and sugar if necessary. Rinse a plain mould in cold water, pour the
custard into it, set the mould in a pan of hot water and bake
twenty-five minutes. Test with a knife. Too long cooking makes the
custard watery. It must be served ice cold and may be prepared the day
before. Serve with cream or soft boiled custard.

the last. Bake half an hour. Serve hot with plenty of sauce.


CARAMEL CUSTARD BAKED.

the fourth of a vanilla bean. Put the milk and vanilla bean cut small
into a double boiler over the fire. Melt the sugar without water in a
spider, stirring constantly until it is all dissolved and the syrup is a
rich golden brown. Do not let it get too dark or it will be bitter. When
the milk is at the boiling point stir in half the boiling syrup--if put
in too fast the milk will boil over. Let it cook until the sugar (if it
hardened as it touched the milk) dissolves. Have four eggs beaten very
light in a bowl, pour the milk over them, add a little salt, and if
vanilla bean is not used for flavoring, stir in extract of vanilla to
taste. Rinse a mould with cold water, pour the custard into it and set
it in a pan of hot water in the oven, bake from twenty to twenty-five
minutes and test with a knife. If it comes out clean it is done. Add
boiling water to the remainder of the syrup and let it cook gently until
it is the consistency of thick cream. Flavor with vanilla. Serve very
cold.


SOFT-BOILED CUSTARD.

Put a quart of rich milk in a double boiler over the fire with a third
of a vanilla bean, split in half, and sugar to taste. Beat the whites of
six eggs to a stiff froth, add three heaping teaspoonfuls of granulated
sugar, and when the milk comes to the boiling point drop the whites of
eggs into it by tablespoonfuls in egg-shape, turn them over in the hot
milk for a few seconds, repeat until all are done, drain them and return
the milk to the saucepan. Beat the six egg yolks to a light cream, turn
the hot milk over it gradually and pour the custard back into the
boiler; return to the fire and stir vigorously until it thickens and is
smooth to the taste. Remove from the fire, pour at once into a bowl, add
a little salt, and set aside to cool. Then put on the ice and at serving
time turn into a glass bowl, arrange the whites of eggs on top and serve
with sponge cake.


A SIMPLE DESSERT.

A loaf of stale sponge cake--one that has been baked in a border mould
looks pretty. Saturate the cake with orange juice to which has been
added a little lemon. Stick the cake over with blanched almonds and fill
the center with whipped cream. If the cake is a plain loaf, pile the
cream around it.


GINGER CREAM.

Soak a quarter of a box of gelatine in half a cup of milk for half an
hour, then place the bowl over steam until the gelatine is perfectly
dissolved. Add to it four ounces of granulated sugar and a pint of

can be used by cutting in slices half an inch thick, each piece dipped
in milk, in which an egg has been stirred, fried brown in a little
butter, and served hot with a sauce.

Beat three yolks of eggs light, add to it half a cup of milk, half a cup
of water, one cup of flour, and a little salt, mix until smooth, then
stir in the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have some
melted butter, brush over the bottom of a frying pan and pour a little
of the batter into it, let it cover the bottom of the pan without being
thicker than paper, let it brown, turning it to brown the other side,
spread with any jelly preferred, fold in half and fold again, making a
wedge-shaped cake. Use all the batter in this way, and serve hot. It
would be well to have two spiders in use.

a quarter of a cup of cream beaten together, and turn the mixture into a
well buttered mould sprinkled thoroughly with fine sifted bread crumbs.

remove from the fire and let it cool. Then stir in an ounce and a half
of sugar, three heaping tablespoonfuls of almonds blanched and chopped
and a little vanilla to flavor--vanilla sugar is better than the
extract--then mix in five well beaten eggs, a little at a time. Turn it
into a well buttered mould sprinkled with dried and sifted bread crumbs,
set in a pan of hot water in the oven, cover to prevent browning and
bake about three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot with a wine or fruit

Cakes.


CAKE MAKING.

Have all the ingredients measured or weighed, the pans lined with paper
or oiled, the nuts or fruit prepared, and the flour sifted before
beginning to make a cake. Sift the baking powder and cream of tartar and
soda with the flour or a part of it. Use pastry flour for all cake.
Never put all the milk into a cake batter by itself, as it curdles and
makes a coarse grained cake, but stir it in alternately with the flour.
Put all loaves of cake into a moderate oven, that they may rise before
beginning to bake. After the cake rises the heat may be increased.


ANGEL CAKE.

The whites of nine large, fresh eggs. When they are partly beaten add
one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar and then finish beating--the

granulated sugar, stir the sugar very lightly into the whites of the
eggs, and add a teaspoonful of vanilla. Have flour sifted five times,
measure a cupful and fold it in very carefully, not with a circular
motion, and do not stir long. Turn it into a Turk's head mould and bake
forty-five minutes. Do not grease the mould, and when taken out of the
oven invert it until the cake is cold before removing from the pan.
Never use a patent egg-beater for this cake, but a whip, taking long,
rapid strokes, and make it in a large platter, not a bowl.

of butter, an even teaspoonful of soda, one pound and a half of sugar
and flour enough to roll. Roll very thin and cut in small cakes; put
half a blanched almond in the middle of each. Bake in a slow oven.


FROSTING.

Three-quarters of a cup of powdered sugar to the white of one egg,
flavoring to taste. Beat the white of egg to a stiff froth and turn all
the sugar into it; see that the sugar is free from lumps, beat hard and
flavor according to the cake.


BOILED ICING.

One cup of granulated sugar, five tablespoonfuls of boiling water, the
white of one egg beaten to a stiff froth. Put the sugar and water over
the fire and boil until it threads from the spoon; then turn it into the
beaten egg, beat briskly for a few minutes, flavor with vanilla, lemon
or almond, according to the cake. While the cake is still warm, sprinkle
with flour and spread the icing on with a broad knife.




Pies.


PLAIN PASTRY.

Four cups of sifted flour, one cup of butter, a pinch of salt, three
heaping teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar, two tablespoonfuls of lemon
juice, four tablespoonfuls of ice water and the yolks of two eggs. This
quantity will make two pies. Rub the butter, flour, salt and sugar
together thoroughly, then add the yolks of eggs, lemon juice and water
and work all together into a paste. Put the dough on a pastry board,
divide in four equal parts, roll each part the size required for the pie
plates.


PUFF PASTE.

One pound of flour, one pound of butter and one cup of ice water. Sift
the flour, weigh it and turn into a mixing bowl; pour the water
gradually into it, stirring constantly with a spoon; turn the dough out
on the pastry board and beat or knead it until it blisters and is so
elastic that it can be stretched without tearing. Then set it away on
ice. Wash the butter, squeeze out the salt and water and lay it on a
plate on ice. Roll the dough as nearly square as possible, lay the
butter in the center of it, fold over one side of the paste, then the
other, flatten slightly with the rolling pin, fold over the ends of the
dough until they meet; turn the dough over and roll twice, fold again
and put the paste on the ice; let it remain for twenty minutes. Repeat
this twice, allowing the pastry to rest twenty minutes each time. This
makes in all six rolls and three times of rolling. Press very lightly
with the rolling pin, cut off each time what is needed for a pie or
number of patties, that the dough will not be worked over more than is
necessary. The trimmings may be used for cheese straws by cutting and
sprinkling them with grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of cayenne
pepper; or may be baked in crescents for garnishing. In baking, rinse
the pans with cold water and brush the pastry over with beaten egg. Make
the pastry in a cool room.


TO MAKE ONE SQUASH OR PUMPKIN PIE.

One cup of squash, one egg mixed unbeaten with the squash, a cup and a
half of sugar, one milk cracker rolled fine, half a teaspoonful each of
ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, a pinch of salt and a dash of cayenne
pepper. After these are well mixed, add half a cup of milk. Bake in
either puff or plain paste.


SWEET RISSOLES.

Roll out some puff paste into a thin sheet, cut as many rounds with a
large patty cutter as are needed; put a spoonful of any kind of jam,
strawberry, raspberry, currant, etc., or mince meat or purée of apples
on each, moisten the edges of the pastry with water, fold one-half over
the other, making them into half moons, brush with beaten egg and bake
in a quick oven. They may be varied by sifting coarse sugar and nuts
over them before baking.

very fine, add to it four ounces of breadcrumbs. Beat to a cream half a
pound of butter and half a pound of sugar, add the curds and bread; beat
four eggs until very thick and light and pour them into this mixture;
then add gradually one tablespoonful of sherry and one of brandy and one
of rose-water, and a teaspoonful of cinnamon, and lastly a quarter of a
pound of currants well washed. Line either pie plates or shallow cake
pans with puff paste, pour in the mixture and bake in a quick oven. They
should be served cold and eaten the day they are baked.


COCOANUT PIE (a Southern Recipe).

One cup of freshly-grated cocoanut, one cup of sugar, three eggs, half a
lemon, juice and grated rind, one-half cup of cream, one-half cup of
butter and one-half cup of cocoanut milk. Beat butter and sugar to a
cream, add other ingredients, the yolks of eggs beaten very light with
the cream, the lemon juice and rind and lastly the whites of eggs beaten
to a stiff froth. Line a dish with puff paste, pour the mixture in and

pound of butter melted, a cup and a half of sherry and a cup of brandy.
Seed the raisins and soak them with the currants in just water enough to
cover, stew until tender, and add when cold with the water to the other
ingredients. Mix thoroughly, stirring in the melted butter at the last.
Let it stand for several days. The brandy and wine may be omitted and
more lemons and oranges used to flavor it. At each baking it is well to
add a little sugar and chopped apple. This will keep all winter or
longer in a cool place, if the brandy and wine are not omitted.




Candies.


CHOCOLATE CARAMELS--No. 1.

chocolate, one pint of cream, one pint of milk, paraffine as large as a
walnut, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Flavor with vanilla. Put all
the ingredients together and boil until it is brittle in water; flavor
and pour into buttered tins and mark in squares before it is quite cold.


CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.--No. 2.

One pint of fresh milk, three ounces of chocolate, grated, two pounds of
granulated sugar, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Stir until
melted, then add half a pint of cream, cook until the mixture is brittle

sugar, one cup of milk and a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a quarter
of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil all together, stirring all the
time, until the syrup hardens in cold water, and just before taking from
the fire add a teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat the syrup as soon as removed
from the fire, and keep it up until it is too stiff to beat any
longer--if it is beaten a minute and a half it will do well. Turn out of
the saucepan into a greased pan and before it is quite cold cut in
squares.


CHOCOLATE CREAM PEPPERMINTS.

Mix together two cups of granulated sugar and half a cup of cream, boil
until it holds well together in cold water, or can be rolled between
the fingers, flavor with oil of peppermint, remove from the fire and
stir until the cream is stiff enough to mould into balls. Use powdered
sugar on the hands while moulding. Melt an ounce of chocolate and dip
the balls, which should be as large as hazel nuts, in this, using a long
pin for the purpose, and lay them on paraffine paper. Any flavoring may
be used instead of peppermint.


CANDY (to Pull).

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, half a cup of water, one tablespoonful
of vinegar, butter the size of a walnut. Boil the sugar and water
without stirring until it is brittle when tried in cold water, add the
butter and vinegar just before it is done. Flavor with any extract
preferred, pour into buttered soup plates, and when cool enough to
handle pull until white.


CHESTNUTS GLACÉ.

Skin the chestnuts and cover with cold water, let them cook gently until
tender, when a large needle can be run through them easily. Drain and
drop them in cold water. After two hours drain again and put them in a
bowl, cover them with a rich syrup that has been skimmed and boiled
until clear. It must be boiling when poured over the chestnuts. Cover
the bowl with a heavy paper and let it stand for twelve hours, drain off
the syrup, bring it to the boiling point and turn it over the chestnuts
again and put away for another twelve hours. Repeat this process three
times, then drain the syrup off and the chestnuts are ready for use. Use
the large imported chestnuts, remove the shells and boil the nuts. The
brown skin can then be easily removed with a penknife. They are very
nice but very troublesome to prepare.


COCOANUT CAKES.

One pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of grated cocoanut, half a
cup of water and a saltspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil the sugar and

strain and pour it over a pound of granulated sugar and a tablespoonful
of vinegar. Boil without stirring, and if any scum rises to the top
remove it. Test the candy in cold water, when brittle remove from the
fire and pour into a buttered pan. Mark into squares before it is cold,
or break into irregular pieces.


MARSHMALLOWS.

Powder very fine eight ounces of gum arabic, dissolve it in three gills
of water over a slow fire and strain. Simmer an ounce and a half of
marshmallow roots in two gills of water, for ten minutes, closely
covered. Strain and reduce to one gill. Add this with half a pound of
sugar to the dissolved gum. Boil until it becomes a thick paste,
stirring constantly. Add the whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth
and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Remove from the fire, pour into a

sharp knife, roll in pulverized sugar and pack in a tin box.


NOUGAT.

A pound of granulated sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one cup of
blanched and finely chopped almonds or peanuts, or it may be made of
mixed nuts. Dissolve the sugar in a spider over the fire without water,
stirring constantly, and when entirely melted mix in the nuts quickly
and pour at once into a well greased pan, and before it is cold mark in
squares. This is very nice pounded fine in a mortar or ground in a mill
to sprinkle over custards just before serving.


PANOCHE (a Spanish Recipe).

Two cups of dark brown sugar, one cup of chopped walnuts, half a cup of
milk, butter the size of a walnut. Cook the sugar and milk together,
boiling gently from seven to ten minutes, until, when tried in water, it
holds well together, and can be rolled into a soft ball. Remove from the
fire. Have the chopped nuts in a large bowl, pour over them a
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, pour the candy over them and beat with
long, rapid strokes until it begins to thicken--it should be like a
cream wafer--turn out on paraffine paper, and break it or cut in pieces.


PEPPERMINT DROPS.

Two cups of granulated sugar, half a cup of cold water, a tiny pinch of
cream of tartar. Boil ten minutes without stirring, let the sugar melt
slowly that it may not burn. Add eight drops of oil of peppermint while
still on the fire. When removed from the stove beat with an egg-beater
until it falls in long drops, when drop quickly on paraffine paper.


PRALINES.

Two cups of granulated sugar, one-half cup of water, two cups of pecans,
hickory nuts or English walnuts. Put the water and sugar on to boil, let
it cook without stirring until it threads, remove from the fire and

of an hour. Grapes can be used instead of currants or cherries.


RED CURRANT JAM.

Pick the currants from the stems, weigh them, and allow three-quarters
of a pound of white sugar to a pound of the fruit. Put the currants in a
preserving kettle, mash them a little to prevent them from sticking to
the kettle, and boil for fifteen minutes, then add the sugar and boil
rapidly for ten minutes. Bottle and seal tight.


RED CURRANT JELLY.

Berries for jelly must be picked when the weather is dry. Pick them
over, taking out all leaves, etc., put them in the kettle and mash them
a little to get enough juice to keep them from burning; stir constantly,
and as soon as hot wring them dry through a cheese cloth. Measure the
liquid and to every pint of juice allow one pound of sugar. Put the
juice on the fire and boil fifteen minutes, then add the sugar and boil
fifteen minutes more, skimming thoroughly. Pour into glasses while hot;
let them stand until the next day and cover. Very often jelly is soft,
and always from one of two reasons: either the berries have been picked
immediately after a rain or the sugar is adulterated.


RED CURRANT SYRUP.

The currants must be fresh and perfectly ripe and picked in dry weather.
Wash and put them in either a porcelain-lined or a granite-ware kettle,
stir until they are tender, as for currant jelly, then remove from the
fire and wring them as dry as possible in a cheese cloth. Measure the
juice and return it to the fire, let it cook fifteen minutes, then add a
pound of granulated sugar to each quart of juice, boil gently fifteen
minutes, skimming as long as the scum rises. Bottle and cork well and
keep in a dark place. Raspberry and strawberry syrup are made in the
same way, only mashing and straining the fruit and measuring the juice
before cooking.


BLACK CURRANT SYRUP.

Pick from the stems and mash them, a few at a time, in a bowl or granite
saucepan with a potato masher, then put them in a stone jar and let them
stand for two days, stirring well each day. Wring them through a cheese
cloth, and if wanted sweet cook with sugar as red currant syrup. The
juice can be bottled without sugar or cooking, and will keep for years.
It is used for sauces or fruit soups, etc.


CRANBERRY JAM.

Put five quarts of cranberries in a preserving kettle with two quarts of
water and boil gently until the fruit is tender, then add three pounds
and three-quarters of granulated sugar, boil until the fruit is clear,
skimming carefully. Put in glasses and when cold seal. It keeps well.


GOOSEBERRY JELLY.

jelly.


GOOSEBERRY JAM.

Three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Put the
fruit on by itself in a porcelain-lined or granite-ware saucepan, mash
and stir well to keep from burning, and boil one hour. Then add the
sugar and boil one hour more.


GRAPE JAM.

Press with the fingers the pulp from grapes--Muscat or Concord grapes
make the best jam--seed and measure them, allowing a cup of sugar to
each cup of fruit. Put the skins on and cook until tender, when almost
done add the pulp, and when all is tender add the sugar and boil until
thick.


PINEAPPLE JAM.

Pare the fruit and carefully take out the eyes, then grate it on a
coarse grater, rejecting the cores, weigh it, and to each pound of fruit
take a pound of sugar. Sprinkle it over the grated pines, let it stand
over night. In the morning, boil for ten or fifteen minutes over a quick
fire. Put in tumblers and when cold cover.


RASPBERRY OR STRAWBERRY JAM.

Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Put the
fruit in a preserving kettle over the fire and boil fifteen minutes,
mashing a little to prevent sticking to the kettle. Then add the sugar
and boil ten minutes, skimming carefully; turn into glasses and seal
when cold.


ORANGE MARMALADE.

Select smooth, thin-skinned, juicy oranges. Take twenty-one, and five
lemons. Cut the rind very thin from a third of the fruit, and boil it in
two quarts of water until it can be pierced easily with a broom straw.
Drain from the water and cut in fine strips with scissors, add this to
the pulp of the oranges and lemons after removing all the white bitter
skin and pips from the fruit. Weigh and allow a pound of sugar to a
pound of fruit, put in a porcelain-lined or granite-ware kettle and cook
until clear. Put in glasses and when cold cover with brandied paper and
seal.


PUMPKIN CHIPS.

Slice very thin and chip about four pounds of pumpkin, put in an
earthenware bowl, and cover it over night with four and a half pounds of
granulated sugar and the juice of one dozen lemons. Boil the lemon peel
until tender and cut in small thin chips and add to the juice, etc. In
the morning, boil together until perfectly clear and crisp.




Pickles, Sauces, etc.


RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLE.

Pare and seed the cucumbers. Slice each cucumber lengthwise in four
pieces or cut it in fancy shapes, cover with cold vinegar and let them
stand for twenty-four hours. Drain and put them in fresh vinegar with
two pounds of sugar, and one ounce of cassia buds to one quart of
vinegar. Boil for twenty minutes and put in jars.


SWEET PICKLED PEACHES.

Select fine, fresh, ripe, but not soft peaches, peel and weigh them. To
every seven pounds of fruit take five pounds of granulated sugar, a pint
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon and one tablespoonful of
cloves, tie the spices up in a muslin bag, add a few pieces of stick
cinnamon and a few allspice. Put the fruit in a stone jar, bring the
sugar, vinegar and spice to a boil, pour over the peaches, cover and let
them stand until the next day, scald the syrup again and pour over the
fruit, and so on, until it has been done in all seven times. Take out
the bag of spice and put the fruit with the syrup into jars and seal.
These are much more delicious than peaches that are cooked.

Follow the recipe for sweet pickled peaches.


SPICED CURRANTS.

Take seven pounds of fresh and perfectly ripe currants, pick them over,
wash and stem them and put in a granite-ware or porcelain-lined kettle,
with five pounds of granulated sugar, one even tablespoonful of cloves,
one tablespoonful of cinnamon, one dessertspoonful of allspice, one pint
of best cider vinegar. Boil an hour and a half, put in jars and when

onion, eight cups of cider or wine vinegar, two cups of brown sugar, two
teaspoonfuls of ginger, three teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, two teaspoonfuls
of allspice, two teaspoonfuls of cloves, eight tablespoonfuls of salt.
Skin the tomatoes and put them in the kettle over the fire; as soon as
the water runs from them, take out half of it, then put in the onions
and peppers chopped, boil together four hours, stir constantly the last
hour to prevent burning, then add the other ingredients and simmer long
enough thoroughly to mix them. Put the sauce in small bottles, cork
tight and seal and keep in a dark place.


CHILI PEPPER SAUCE.

Twenty ripe tomatoes, six green peppers and four white onions chopped
fine, two cups of best wine or cider vinegar, one cup of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of salt, two even teaspoonfuls of ground mace, two
teaspoonfuls of nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls of cloves, one teaspoonful of
celery seed. Boil an hour and bottle while hot. Very nice to serve with
baked beans.


MUSTARD PICKLES.

One quart each of tiny whole cucumbers, large cucumbers sliced, green
tomatoes sliced and small button onions, one large cauliflower divided
into flowerettes, and four green peppers cut fine. Make a brine of four
quarts of water and one pint of salt, pour it over the mixed vegetables
and let it stand covered twenty-four hours. Then scald it and turn into
a colander to drain. Mix one cup of flour, six tablespoonfuls of
mustard, and one tablespoonful of turmeric with enough vinegar to make a
smooth paste, add one cup of granulated sugar and sufficient vinegar to
make two quarts in all. Boil this mixture until it is thick and smooth,
stirring constantly, then add the vegetables and heat them through.


RIPE TOMATO PICKLE.

A peck of perfectly ripe tomatoes, two quarts of fine cooking salt, half
a pound of ground mustard, one ounce of cloves, two green peppers, two
or three onions and one pound of brown sugar. Pierce the tomatoes with a
silver fork or broom straw, put them in a stone jar with salt in
alternate layers. Throw away all the liquor made by standing one week.
Return to jar and cover with cold water, cover and let it stand
twenty-four hours. Drain again thoroughly, throw away the water, return
the tomatoes to the jar and cover with cold vinegar, having added to the
fruit, the onions and peppers sliced, with the mustard, cloves and
sugar. After they have stood three weeks they are ready for use.


GREEN TOMATO PICKLES.

One peck of sliced tomatoes, eight onions, one pound of bell peppers,
one pound of horse radish, one pound of white mustard seed, half a pound
of black mustard seed, half an ounce of whole cloves, half an ounce of
stick cinnamon, half an ounce of pepper corns, one or two nutmegs and
four pounds of sugar. Select the tomatoes when they are beginning to
turn white, slice and lay them in salt for twenty-four hours. Drain and
put in the kettle, which should be of granite ware or porcelain lined,
with the peppers, onions and horse radish chopped, and sprinkle the
mustard seeds over all. Tie the spices in a thin muslin bag and cover
the whole with best wine vinegar, boil until tender and clear in
appearance. The peppers should have all the seeds removed. Half a cup of
dry mustard is considered by some an improvement.


GOOSEBERRY CATSUP.

fruit, but drain as dry as possible by lightly pressing it. The last
time strain it through muslin previously wet with vinegar to prevent
waste. Put into a preserving kettle with a pound of sugar to every pint
of juice. Stir until the sugar is melted and let it cook gently for five
minutes, skim it. When cold, bottle and cork well.

half cupfuls of boiling water, let it boil a few minutes, then add two
heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, two even teaspoonfuls of cornstarch
rubbed to a paste with a little cold water, then add a cupful of canned
fruit or a glass of any kind of fruit or jelly liked and the juice of a
lemon. Press through a fine sieve and serve with fritters or puddings.


FRESH FRUIT SAUCE.

Follow the above recipe, using a cupful of pure juice of the fruit
desired and the juice of either a half or whole lemon.


ORANGE SAUCE.

Beat four egg yolks, three ounces of sugar, a teaspoonful of flour and
the grated rind of one orange together until light, add a pint of
boiling milk and stir over the fire until thick, taking care that it
does not curdle, remove from the fire and add a liqueur glass of
curaçao, and beat until light and foaming.


BANANA SAUCE.

Rub two bananas through a fine sieve. Put half a cup of granulated sugar
in a saucepan with one cup of boiling water, add the banana pulp to it,
let it come to a boil, and skim if necessary. Rub a heaping
tablespoonful of butter with half a tablespoonful of flour, stir into it
a little of the liquid, and then add to that in the saucepan; add the
juice and grated rind of half a lemon, and it is ready to serve.


FOAMING SAUCE.

Beat to a cream a cup of sugar and a quarter of a cup of butter, and add
to it two tablespoonfuls of wine or fruit juice, or in winter fruit
syrup. If the latter, use only three-quarters of a cup of sugar. At
serving time add a quarter of a cup of boiling water, stir well, then
add the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth. Beat until the sauce
foams.


HARD SAUCE.

Cream one tablespoonful of butter, stir in four tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar and beat until very light, then add a teaspoonful of
boiling water and beat again. Flavor to suit taste.


SOUTHERN SAUCE.

Beat four tablespoonfuls of brown sugar with two tablespoonfuls of
butter to a cream, and add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, set the
bowl in a pan of hot water on the stove and stir until thick, add a
glass of sherry, stir well and it is ready to serve.


VANILLA SAUCE.

Put a pint of rich milk in a double boiler, sweeten with two
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. While the milk is coming to the
boiling point beat the yolks of four eggs until light and creamy, add
the hot milk to the eggs, stirring briskly, then turn it into the
boiler, stirring rapidly until it thickens, remove from the fire, turn
into a bowl, flavor with vanilla extract and serve very cold.

teaspoonful of potato flour, half a cup of water, the rind of half and
the juice of one lemon. Beat quickly over hot water until the sauce
thickens, then serve at once.


MAPLE SYRUP SAUCE.

Half a pound of maple sugar dissolved in half a cup of cream, or rich
milk. If the latter is used add a teaspoonful of butter.




Savory Sauces.


In making sauces great care should be taken to have the saucepans
scrupulously clean and only granite-ware or porcelain-lined saucepans
should be used, especially where there is any acid as in tomatoes or
pickles. Never use an iron spider except for browning butter and flour
together as they will not brown in a saucepan.


VEGETABLE STOCK FOR SAUCES.

Take any kinds of vegetables convenient, such as parsnips, celery,
carrots, turnips, green pepper, onion, leek, parsley, celery tops,
celery root, Jerusalem artichokes, a bay leaf, two cloves, two allspice,
and cook in water until tender; strain, pressing all from the
vegetables. The water Jerusalem artichokes are boiled in is valuable for
sauces. The liquid from canned peas is also excellent. Care must be
taken in putting the vegetables together not to let any one predominate,
turnip especially, as it makes a sauce very bitter.


COLORING FOR SAUCES, SOUPS, Etc.

Melt a quarter of a pound of granulated sugar in a spider, cook until it
is a very dark, rich brown, almost black, stir constantly. Great care
must be taken that it does not burn. When done pour over it a quart of
boiling water and let it cook until the caramel is entirely dissolved,
pour it out and when cold strain and bottle. It will keep indefinitely
and a tablespoonful will give color to a pint of liquid.


OLIVE SAUCE.

Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider and when it begins to
brown stir into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour, let it cook until
a very dark brown, but be careful not to let it burn, then add enough
rich vegetable stock to make a thick cream-like sauce. Have ready some
olives--six or seven, that have been boiled a few minutes in water and
cut from the stones, add these to the sauce, season with pepper and salt
to taste, bring to the boiling point and serve.


SAUCE HOLLANDAISE.

One-quarter of a pound of butter, one-quarter of a cup of water,
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, the juice of a quarter of a lemon,
a dash of cayenne, and the yolks of three eggs. Beat the butter to a
cream and stir in the yolks of eggs, one at a time, then the lemon
juice, salt and pepper. Set the bowl it is mixed in in a pan of boiling
water on the fire, beating constantly with an egg beater, and when it
begins to thicken stir in gradually the boiling water. When it is as
thick as soft custard it is done. Great care must be taken not to let it
remain too long on the fire or it will curdle.


DRAWN BUTTER OR CREAM SAUCE.

Melt a large heaping tablespoonful of butter and stir into it a heaping
teaspoonful of flour, let them cook together without browning and add by
degrees a cup of hot milk.


CURRY SAUCE.

Curry sauce is made by adding curry powder to taste to a white sauce. It
may likewise be added to a brown sauce.


CHEESE SAUCE.

A white or cream sauce with grated Parmesan cheese added to taste.


TOMATO SAUCE.

Melt a large tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan over the fire, when
it bubbles put into it a small onion and half a green pepper, if
convenient, chopped very fine. Simmer gently for a few minutes, then
stir in a heaping teaspoonful of flour, and add four nice, fresh
tomatoes peeled and cut small--canned tomatoes may be used--a gill of
vegetable stock, a clove and part of a bay leaf, and pepper and salt to
taste. Let it cook gently for half an hour and press through a fine
sieve.


SAUCE TARTARE

may be made by beating a small tablespoonful of butter to a cream,
adding salt, pepper, dry mustard and sugar to taste and the raw yolk of
an egg. Add a tablespoonful of olives, small cucumbers and capers
chopped very fine and a few drops of onion juice. Serve with mock fish
cutlets and croquettes.


SAUCE PIQUANTE.

Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider and when it bubbles
stir into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour, cook until it turns a
dark brown, taking care not to let it burn, add to it enough
well-seasoned vegetable stock to make the sauce the proper consistency,
then pour it into a granite-ware saucepan and add one small cucumber
pickle, two olives and a few capers, all chopped very fine; season with
salt and pepper to taste.




Sandwiches.


CHEESE SANDWICHES.

Half a pound of grated cheese, one tablespoonful of butter, the yolks of
two hard-boiled eggs mashed very fine and a teaspoonful of mayonnaise
dressing. Mix the ingredients thoroughly; butter before cutting from the
loaf some slices of brown or white home-made bread; spread with the
mixture and fold together.


CELERY SANDWICHES.

Use dainty little baking powder biscuits freshly baked but cold, or
white home-made bread for these sandwiches. Only the very tender part of
celery should be used and chopped fine and put in iced water until
needed. Add a few chopped walnuts to the celery and enough mayonnaise
dressing to hold them together; butter the bread before cutting from the
loaf, spread one slice with the mixture and press another over it. If
biscuits are used, split and butter them. They should be small and very
thin for this purpose and browned delicately.


NUT AND CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES.

Boston brown bread buttered on the loaf and cut in very thin slices;
spread with a filling of cream cheese and chopped walnut meats; press a
buttered slice over it. They may be cut in fingers, rounds or
half-moons. The proportion is three-quarters of a cup of nuts to a
ten-cent package of Philadelphia cream cheese. This quantity will make a
large number of sandwiches.


NUT SANDWICHES.

Graham, rye, and Boston brown bread make very nice sandwiches. Butter
the loaf and cut in very thin slices, sprinkle with chopped nuts and
fold together.


WHOLE WHEAT BREAD AND PEANUT SANDWICHES.

Chop the nuts very fine, butter the bread before cutting from the loaf,
sprinkle the nuts thickly over the butter, press two slices together.
Boston brown bread with raisins is also nice for these sandwiches.


OLIVE SANDWICHES.

Prepare the bread and butter as for other sandwiches. It may be cut in
squares, rounds or triangles to suit the fancy. Stone and chop as many
Queen olives as needed and mix with them enough mayonnaise dressing to
hold together, spread half the number of bread slices with the mixture
and cover with the other half.

Brown, rye, whole wheat or white bread may be used. Home-made is
preferable, but it must be twelve hours old. Sandwiches may be sweet or
savory, may be cut round, square, or in triangles.




Sundries.


CRACKERS AND CHEESE TOASTED.

Butter some zepherettes and sprinkle thickly with grated Parmesan
cheese, bake in a quick oven, or toast on a gridiron; serve hot.


CRACKERS WITH CREAM CHEESE AND GUAVA JELLY.

Spread zepherettes with cream cheese and dot with Guava jelly.


WELSH RAREBIT.

Half a pound of American cheese, two butter balls, two eggs, half a
teaspoonful of mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne
pepper, half a cup of milk and an even saltspoonful of soda. Cut the
cheese fine, melt the butter in a chafing dish or spider, stir the
mustard, salt and pepper with it, then add the cheese and milk; when the
cheese is dissolved add the eggs slightly beaten and stir until it
thickens. Serve on toast.


CHEESE SOUFFLÉ.

Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a spider, add to it a slightly
heaping tablespoonful of flour and one cup of hot milk, half a
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper and one cup of grated
Parmesan cheese; then add the yolks of three eggs beaten light, remove
from the fire and let it cool; then add the whites of eggs beaten stiff,
turn into a pudding dish, bake twenty-five minutes and serve
immediately.


CHEESE STRAWS.

Take two ounces of flour and three ounces of Parmesan cheese grated (it
is better to buy the cheese by the pound and have it grated at home),
and two ounces of butter. Rub the butter into the flour, add the cheese
and a little salt and cayenne pepper, and make into a paste with the
yolk of an egg; roll the paste out in a sheet about an eighth of an inch
thick and five inches wide and cut in narrow strips; bake in a hot oven
about ten minutes.


PÂTE À CHOU FOR SOUPS.

Put a gill of milk and an ounce of butter into a saucepan over the fire;
when it comes to the boiling point add two ounces of sifted flour; stir
with a wooden spoon until thick and smooth, then add two eggs, one at a
time, beating briskly; remove from the fire and spread out thin, cut in
pieces, the size of a small bean, put them in a sieve, dredge with
flour, shake it well and fry in boiling fat until a nice brown. Add to
the soup after it is in the tureen.


A FILLING FOR PATTIES.

Break two eggs in a bowl, add a little salt and white pepper, a few
drops of onion juice and four tablespoonfuls of cream, beat slightly;
turn into a buttered tin cup, stand in a saucepan with a little boiling
water in it on the stove, cover and cook until stiff--about three or
four minutes--remove from the fire, turn out of the cup. When ready to
use cut in half-inch slices and then into stars or any fancy shape
preferred, or into dice. Make a cream sauce thicker than for other uses,
that it may not run through the pastry; put them in the sauce, bring to
the boiling point and fill the patties just as they are to be served.


GRUEL OF KERNEL FLOUR OR MIDDLINGS.

Put a pint of boiling water in a saucepan over the fire; mix two heaping
teaspoonfuls of the flour with a little cold water and stir into the
boiling water. Let it boil twenty minutes, add a little cream to it and
salt. Very nutritious.


KOUMYSS.

Dissolve a third of a cake of compressed yeast in a little tepid water;
take a quart of milk, fresh from the cow, or warmed to blood heat, and
add to it a tablespoonful of sugar and the dissolved yeast. Put the
mixture immediately in beer bottles with patent stoppers, filling to the
neck, and let them stand for twelve hours where bread would be set to
rise--that is, in a temperature of 68 or 70 degrees--then stand the
bottles upside down on ice until wanted.


HOME-MADE BAKING POWDER.

Procure from a reliable druggist one-half pound of the best bicarbonate
of soda, one pound of cream of tartar and one-half pound of Kingsford's
cornstarch. Mix thoroughly and sift three times, put up in small tins.
The best baking powder.


VANILLA EXTRACT.

One ounce of Mexican vanilla bean, two ounces of loaf sugar, eight
ounces of French rose water, twenty-four ounces of alcohol 95 per cent.
Cut up the bean and pound with the sugar in a mortar, sift and pound
again until all is a fine powder. Mix the alcohol and rose water; put
the vanilla in a paper filter, pour over it a little of the liquid at a
time until all is used; filter again if not all is dissolved. Paper
filters may be obtained at any of the large drug stores. The extract may
be darkened by using a little caramel.


VANILLA SUGAR.

Half a pound of loaf sugar, half an ounce of Mexican vanilla beans. Cut
the beans very fine, pound in a mortar with the sugar; sift and pound
again until all is fine. Bottle and cork tight and keep in a dark
place.


SPINACH FOR COLORING.

Pound some spinach in a mortar, adding a little water; squeeze through a
cheese cloth, put in a saucepan over the fire, bring to a boil; when it
curdles remove from the stove. Strain through a very fine sieve; what
remains on the under part of the sieve is the coloring. It is used for
coloring pistache ice cream, jellies, etc.


TOMATO PASTE FOR SANDWICHES.

Skin and cut small three large tomatoes, cook until tender and press
through a sieve fine enough to retain the seeds; return to the fire, add
two ounces of butter, two ounces of grated bread crumbs and two ounces
of grated Parmesan cheese. When it boils stir a beaten egg quickly into
it, remove at once from the fire. It must not boil after the egg is
added, as it will curdle. Turn the mixture into a bowl and when cold, if
it is not for immediate use, cover with melted butter.


CHEESE PASTE FOR SANDWICHES.

Boil two eggs hard, separate the yolks from the whites, mash the yolks
smooth and chop the whites very fine; mix and put through a vegetable
press, then add butter the size of a small egg and three heaping
tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. Beat together until it is a
fine, smooth paste. If not salt enough add a little, and also dry
mustard, if liked.




Miscellaneous Recipes.


TOOTH POWDER.

Precipitated chalk, seven ounces; Florentine orris, four ounces;
bicarbonate of soda, three ounces; powdered white Castile soap, two
ounces; thirty drops each of oil of wintergreen and sassafras. Sift all
together and keep in a glass jar or tin box. A very valuable recipe for
hardening the teeth.


JAPANESE CREAM.

Four ounces of ammonia, four ounces of white Castile soap cut fine, two
ounces of alcohol, two ounces of Price's glycerine and two ounces of
ether. Put the soap in one quart of water over the fire; when dissolved
add four quarts of water; when cold add the other ingredients, bottle
and cork tight. It will keep indefinitely. It should be made of soft
water or rain water. To wash woolens, flannels, etc., take a teacup of
the liquid to a pail of lukewarm water, and rinse in another pail of
water with half a cup of the cream. Iron while damp on the wrong side.
For removing grass stains, paint, etc, use half water and half cream.


ORANGE FLOWER LOTION FOR THE COMPLEXION.

Dissolve a slightly heaping tablespoonful of Epsom salts in a pint of
imported orange flower water (Chiris de Grasse), and add to it one
tablespoonful of witch hazel. Apply with a soft linen cloth. Very
refreshing in warm weather and an excellent remedy for oiliness of the
skin.


BAY RUM.

Three-quarters of an ounce of oil of bay, one ounce of loaf sugar, one
pint of alcohol, 95 per cent., two quarts of new New England rum and
three pints of rectified spirits, 60 per cent. Roll the sugar until fine
and beat into the oil of bay, add the alcohol, then the New England rum
and spirits. Let it stand for several days in a demijohn, shaking
occasionally; then filter through blotting paper. The filters may be
purchased at a druggist's. Care should be taken to buy the oil at a
reliable place.


FINE LAVENDER WATER.

Two ounces finest oil of lavender, one ounce essence of musk, one-half
ounce essence of ambergris, one-half ounce oil of bergamot and one-half
gallon of rectified spirits. Mix the ingredients, keep in a demijohn for
several days, shaking occasionally. Then filter and bottle.


GOOD HARD SOAP.

Five pounds of grease, one quart and one cup of cold water, one can of
potash, one heaping tablespoonful of borax, two tablespoonfuls of
ammonia. Dissolve the potash in the water, then add the borax and
ammonia and stir in the lukewarm grease slowly and continue to stir
until it becomes as thick as thick honey; then pour into a pan to
harden. When firm cut into cakes. Grease that is no longer fit to fry in
is used for this soap. Strain it carefully that no particles of food are
left in it. It makes no difference how brown the grease is, the soap
will become white and float in water. It should be kept a month before
using.


POLISH FOR HARD OR STAINED WOOD FLOORS.

Eight ounces of yellow beeswax, two quarts of spirits of turpentine, one
quart of Venetian turpentine. Cut the wax in small pieces and pour the
spirits over it--it will soon dissolve; then bottle. Apply with a
flannel or soft cloth. It keeps the floors in excellent order.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
