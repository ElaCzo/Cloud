_The student of our early literature and language is indebted to the
zeal of Sir Thomas Phillipps, for the discovery of the following
interesting Fragment, which appears to have formed part of a volume that
contained Ælfric's Grammar and Glossary, probably of the Twelfth
Century. The fragments were discovered among the archives of Worcester
Cathedral; and in 1836 Sir Thomas Phillipps printed the whole of them in
folio. I know not whether the form or the typographical arrangement has
been the cause of the neglect of this publication; but it has escaped
both Mr. Wright and Mr. Thorpe. The former, in his interesting edition
of "The Latin Poems of Walter de Mapes," where he has given the literary
history of this legend with extracts, has not even referred to our
fragment; nor has Mr. Thorpe adverted to it in his publication of the
"Codex Exoniensis," which contains an Anglo-Saxon poem of the same kind,
with which it is interesting to compare this later version of the
legend. There is a portion of another semi-Saxon poem, entitled "The
Grave," printed in Mr. Conybeare's "Illustrations," and by Mr. Thorpe in
his "Analecta Anglo-Saxonica," which appears to be by the same hand, or
at any rate of the same school and age. Indeed some of the lines and
thoughts are identical with passages of the following poem. Mr. Thorpe
has justly called "The Grave" a singularly impressive and almost
appalling fragment; expressions equally characteristic of that with
which the reader is here presented._

_This impressive character, coupled with the interest which the fragment
possesses, as a specimen of the moral poetry of our ancestors, and as
throwing light upon the transition of our language from Saxon to
English, has been the motive for producing it in a more legible form
than that in which it first appeared._

_In one of the smaller poems (No. V.), printed by Mr. Wright with the
Owl and the Nightingale, from the Cottonian MS. Calig. A. ix. "The sorie
sowle maketh hire mone," in language not dissimilar to that used in the
following fragment; and the dreary imagery of the house appointed for
all living, and the punishment which awaits a wicked life at its close,
are painted in an equally fearful manner._

_Mr. Thorpe points to an Anglo-Saxon prose Homily as the original of the
poem on the same theme in the Exeter MS., which is repeated, with some
variation, in the Vercelli Codex. In a rude and simple age this dramatic
way of awakening the sinner to a sense of his perilous state, was
perhaps the most effective that could have been chosen, and it was
naturally a favorite with the moral and religious teachers for some
centuries. M. Karajan, in a very pleasing little publication
(Frülingsgabe für freunde Alterer Literatur, Wien 1839) has printed the
"Visio Philiberti," a Latin poem in dialogue on this subject, with two
old German versions; and the notes contain some interesting information
relating to similar compositions; but Mr. Wright's volume, before
referred to, contains ample illustrations of the legend in all
languages._

_The fragment here given, it will be seen, is very defective. An attempt
has been made to supply words which were wanting, from the mutilation of
the MS. leaves; but what is engrafted on the original is scrupulously
distinguished by the Italic character. A version has also been added,
the imperfections of which those who are acquainted with the
difficulties of such renderings will best know how to excuse._

_The language of this poem seems to have a striking resemblance to that
of one of the MSS. of Laȝamon, and we may hope, when the lovers of
our early lore shall be favoured with the long and anxiously expected
edition of that work by Sir Frederick Madden, that much light will be
thrown upon the history of the transitions of our language._

_For what has been already done by Conybeare, Price, Kemble, Thorpe,
Madden, Stevenson, Wright, Way and others, the present writer is most
grateful; but he would wish to see the same spirit and enthusiasm, the
same unwearied zeal displayed in the elucidation of the noble remains of
our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, and of the interesting stores of our early
literature and language, which has been so long a distinguishing feature
of Germany, whose example has of late years lighted up a similar
patriotic flame in France and Belgium._

_thon_ne heo onfoth hore dom.           then they receive their doom
of drihtenes muthe.                     from the Lord's mouth,
also hit is awriten.                    as it is written;
of _drih_tenes muthe.                   from the Lord's mouth:
_Ite maledicti in ignem eternum._ 470   _Ite maledicti in ignem eternum._

and alle _theo_ weren prickiende.       and they all were pricking
so wiles on ile.                  520   like quills on porcupine;

heouene and eorthe.                     heaven and earth,
luft and engles.                        air and angels,

on holie wisdome.                       in holy wisdom,
_Fiat et facta sunt omnia._       565   _Fiat et facta sunt omnia._
He seide iwu_rthe_.                     He said, let be,
_and_ alle thing iworthen.              and all things were;
thus mid one worde.                     thus with one word
al hit was iwurthen.                    was all created;

For thine fule sunne.                   For thy wicked sin

and then feonde icweme.                 and pleasing to the fiend.
Mid wowe _dreames_.                     With unjust judgments,
and mid gultes feole.             600   and with many trespasses,
_thu_ othre birefedest.                 thou bereaved others

ac hit is nu all igon.                  but it is now all gone

Nu lith thin _bodige_ stille.           Now lieth thy body still

_for_ heo was faken biforen.            for she was deceitful before,
and atterne bihinden.                   and envenomed after;
heo demde feole domes.                  she pronounced many judgments

Iseid hit is on psalme.           615   It is said in the Psalm,
and ful sothe hit is bihire.            and full true it is of her:
_Lingua tua concinnabat dolos._         _Lingua tua concinnabat dolos._
Heo ȝeothede fakenliche.                She poured out deceitfully,
and then feonde icwemde.                and pleased the fiend;

and _icwem_de tha wrecches.             and delighted the wretches.
scearpe heo was and kene.               Sharp she was and keen,
and cwemde then deofle.                 and pleased the devil
mid alle then sun_ne_.                  with all the sin
_that_ efre was his wille.        625   that ever was his will.
A wurthe hire wa.                       Wo be to her!
that heo spekinde was so.               that she spake so;

to deoppere helle.                      to deeper hell.

_Uxor tua sicut vitis habundans._ 645   _Uxor tua sicut vitis habundans._

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
