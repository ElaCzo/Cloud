NOTES.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.

The following remarks are supplementary to a note on the hippopotamus in
Vol. ii, p. 35. In that note the exhibition of the hippopotamus at the
Roman games is not traced lower than the time of the Emperor Commodus.
Helagabalus, however, 218-22 A.D., had hippopotami among the various rare
animals which he displayed in public as a part of his state. (Lamprid. c.
28) A hippopotamus was likewise in the vast collection of animals which
were prepared for the Persian triumph of Gordian III., but were exhibited
at the secular games celebrated by the Emperor Philip in the 1000th year of
Rome, 248 A.D. (_Capitol. in Gordian. Tert_., c. 33.) In the seventh
eclogue of Calpurnius, a countryman describes the animals which he saw in
the Roman amphitheatre, among which is the hippopotamus:

 "Non solum nobis silvestria cernere monstra
  Contigit; æquoreos ego cum certantibus ursis
  Spectavi vitulos, et equorum nomine dignum,
  Sed deforme genus, quod in illo nascitur amni
  Qui sata riparum venientibus irrigat undis."
                          VII. 64--8.

Calpurnius is generally referred to the time of Carus and Numerian, about
283 A.D.; but his date is not determined by any satisfactory proof. (See
Dr. Smith's _Dict. of Ancient Biog. and Myth_. in v.)

There is no trace of a live hippopotamus having been brought to Europe
between the time specified in the last of these testimonies and the middle
of the sixteenth century. When Belon visited Constantinople, he saw there a
living hippopotamus, which had been brought from the Nile:

    "L'animal que j'ai veu vivant à Constantinople (he says), apporté du
    Nil, convenoit en toutes marques avec ceulx qu'on voit gravez en
    diverses medales des Empereurs."--_Observations_, liv. ii. c. 32. fol.
    103. b. ed. 1564.

Belon returned to Paris from the Levant in the year 1550. In his work on
fishes, p. 17., he speaks of another Frenchman, lately returned from
Constantinople, who had seen the same animal. (See Schneider on _Artedi
Synonym. Piscium_, p. 267.) P. Gillius likewise, who visited Constantinople
in 1550, saw there the same hippopotamus, as he states in his description
of the elephant, Hamburg, 114. (Schneider, _Ib._ p. 316.)

Your correspondent, MR. G. S. JACKSON (Vol. ii., p. 277.) controverts the
opinion expressed in my former note, that none of the Greek writers had
seen a live hippopotamus. He thinks that "Herodotus's way of speaking would
seem to show that he was describing from his own observation;" and he
infers that the animal was found at that time as far north as the Delta,
from the fact, mentioned by Herodotus, of its being held sacred in the nome
of Papremis. But, in the first place, it does not follow that, because the
hippopotamus was held sacred in the Papremitic nome, it was found in the
{458} Nile as low as that district. In the next place, there is nothing in
the words of Herodotus to indicate that he had seen the object of his
description. (ii. 71.) On the other hand, the substance of his description
tends strongly to the inference that he had _not_ seen the animal. It is
difficult to conceive that any eye-witness could have described a
hippopotamus as having the hoofs of an ox, with the mane and tail of a
horse. His information as to javelins being made of its skin was doubtless
correct, and he may perhaps have seen some of these weapons. Cuvier
conjectures that the original author of the description in Herodotus had
seen only the teeth and some part of the skin of the real hippopotamus; but
that the other particulars were taken from a figure or description of the
gnu (_Trad. de Pline_, tom. vi. p. 444.) This supposition is improbable,
for the gnu is an animal of Southern Africa, and was doubtless unknown to
the Egyptians in the time of Herodotus. Moreover, Cuvier is in error as to
the statement of Herodotus respecting the animal's size: he says that the
animal is equal in size, not to an ass, but to the largest ox. The
statement as to the ass is to be found in Arist. _Hist. An._, ii. 7.
Cuvier's note is hastily written; for he says that Diodorus describes the
hippopotamus as equalling the strongest bulls,--a statement not to be found
in Diodorus. (i. 35.) His judgment, however, is clear, as to the point that
none of the ancient naturalists described the hippopotamus from autopsy.
The writer of the accurate history of the hippopotamus in the _Penny
Cyclopædia_, vol. xii. p. 247., likewise takes the same view. If Achilles
Tatius is correct in stating that "the horse of the Nile" was the native
Egyptian name of the animal, it is probable that the resemblance to the
horse indicated in the description of Herodotus, was supplied by the
imagination of some informant.

In the mosaic of Palestrina (see Barthelemy in _Mém. de l'Acad. des
Inscript._, tom. xxx. p. 503.), the hippopotamus appears three times in the
lower part of the composition, at the left-hand corner. Two entire figures
are represented, and one head of an animal sinking into the river. Men in a
boat are throwing darts at them, some of which are sticking in their backs.
(See _Ib._ p. 521.) Diodorus (i. 35.) describes the hippopotamus as being
harpooned, and caught in a manner similar to the whale. Barthelemy properly
rejects the supposition that the mosaic of Palestrina is the one alluded to
by Pliny (_Hist. Nat._ xxxvi. 64.) as having been constructed by Sylla. He
places it in the time of Hadrian, and supposes it to represent a district
of Upper Egypt, with which the introduction of the hippopotamus well
accords. The true form of the hippopotamus was unknown in Italy in the time
of Sylla.

The word [Greek: hippopotamos] as used by the Latin writers, instead of
[Greek: hippos potamios] occurs in Lucian (_Rhet. Præcept._, c. 6.). The
author of the _Cynegetica_, who addresses his poem to the Emperor
Caracalla, describes the hippopotamus under the name of [Greek: hippagros],
"the wild horse," compounded like [Greek: onagros] (iii. 251-61.). In this
passage the old error as to the cloven hoofs and the mane is repeated. It
is added that the animal will not endure captivity; but if any one is
snared by means of ropes, he refuses to eat or drink. That this latter
statement is fabulous, is proved by the hippopotamus taken alive to
Constantinople, and by the very tame animal now in the Zoological Garden.

The fable about the hippopotamus destroying its father and violating its
mother, cited before from Damascius, is to be found in Plutarch, _De
Solert. Anim._, c. 4. Pausan. (viii. 46. § 4.) mentions a Greek statue, in
which the face was made of the teeth of the hippopotamus instead of ivory.

An interesting account of the younger hippopotamus in the Zoological
Garden, by Professor Owen, may be seen in the _Annals and Magazine of
Natural History_ for June last.

PARALLEL PASSAGES: COLERIDGE, HOOKER, BUTLER.

I do not remember to have seen the following parallels pointed out.

Coleridge. _The Nightingale. A conversation poem:_

                     "The nightingale--
 'Most musical, most melancholy' bird!
  A melancholy bird! Oh! idle thought!
  In nature there is nothing melancholy.
  But some night-wandering man whose heart was pierced
  With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,
      .    .    .    . he, and such as he,
  First named these notes a melancholy strain."

Plato Phædo, § 77. (p. 85., Steph.):

    "Men, because they fear death themselves, slander the swans, and say
    that they sing from pain lamenting their death, and do not consider
    that no bird sings when hungry, or cold, or suffering any other pain;
    no, not even the nightingale, and the swallow, and the hoopoe, which
    you know are said to sing for grief," &c.

Hooker, E. P. I. c.5. § 2.:

    "All things therefore coveting as much as may be to be like unto God in
    being ever, that which cannot hereunto attain personally doth seek to
    continue itself another way, that is, by offspring and propagation."

    Clem. Alex. Strom. II. 23. § 138. (p. 181. Sylb.)

Sir J. Davies. _Immortality of the Soul_, sect 7.:

 "And though the soul could cast spiritual seed,
  Yet would she not, because she never dies;
  For mortal things desire their like to breed,
  That so they may their kind immortalise."

{459}

Plato Sympos. §32. (p. 207. D. Steph.):

    "Mortal natures seek to attain, suffer as they can, to immortality; but
    they can attain to it by this generation only; for thus they ever leave
    a new behind them to supply the place of the old." Compare § 31.
    "Generation immortalises the mortal, so for as it can be
    immortalised."--Plato _Leg_. iv. (p. 721. G.), vi. § 17. (p. 773. E.);
    Ocell. Lucan. iv. § 2.

    "Which [external goods], according to a very ancient observation, the
    most abandoned would choose to obtain by innocent means, if they there
    as easy, and as effectual to their end."

Dr. Whewell has not, I think, in his edition, pointed out the passage
alluded to, Cic. _de Fin._ III., c. 11. § 36.:

    "Quis est enim, aut quis unquam fuit aut avaritiâ tam ardenti, aut tam
    effrenatis cupiditatibus, ut eamdem illam rem, quam adipisci scelere

SHAKSPEARE AND THE OLD ENGLISH ACTORS IN GERMANY.

My studies on the first appearance of Shakspeare on the German stage, by
means of the so-called "English Comedians" who from the end of the
sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century visited Germany and the
Netherlands, led me to the following passage of a Dutch author:

    "In the Voyages of Vincent le Blanc through England, I met with a
    description of the representation of a most absurd tragedy, which I
    recognised to be the _Titus Andronicus_ of Shakspeare."

I have examined the _Voyages of Vincent le Blanc_ without having been able
to discover the passage alluded to; and as the Dutch author says that some
time had elapsed between his first reading those _Voyages_ and the
composition of his treatise, and as he seems to quote only from memory, I
am led to believe his having confounded Vincent le Blanc with some other
traveller of the same period.

Undoubtedly one of your numerous readers can furnish me with the title of
the work in which such a description occurs, or with the name of some other
foreign traveller who may have visited England at the period alluded to,
and in whose works I may find the description mentioned above.

TEN CHILDREN AT A BIRTH.

The following circumstance, although perhaps hardly coming within the
ordinary scope of the "NOTES AND QUERIES," appears to me too curious to
allow a slight doubt to prevent the attempt to place it on permanent and
accessible record. Chancing, the other day, to overhear an ancient gossip
say that there was living in her neighbourhood a woman who was one of _ten_
children born at the same time, I laughed at her for her credulity,--as
well I might! As, however, she mentioned a name and place where I might
satisfy myself, I called the next day at a small greengrocer's shop in this
town, the mistress of which, a good-looking, respectable woman, aged
seventy, at once assured me that her mother, whose name was Birch, and came
from Derby, had been delivered of _ten children_; my informant having been
the only one that lived, "_the other nine_," she added, "_being in bottle
in the Museum in London_!" On mentioning the matter to a respectable
professional gentleman of this place, he said "he had a recollection of the
existence of a glass jar, which was alleged to contain some such
preparation, in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, as mentioned
when he was a pupil in London." Of the question, or the fact, of so
marvellous a gestation and survivorship in the history of human nature
should strike the editor of "NOTES AND QUERIES" as forcibly as his
correspondent, the former, should he publish this article, may perhaps be
kind enough to accompany it with the result of at least an inquiry, as to
whether or not the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons does contain
anything like corroborative evidence of so strange, and, if true, surely so
unprecedented a phenomenon.

N. D.

    [We are enabled by the courtesy of Professor Owen to state that there
    exists no corroboration of this remarkable statement in the Museum of
    the College of Surgeons. The largest number at a birth, of which any
    authentic record appears, is five, and the Museum contains, in case No.
    3681, five children, of about five months, all females, which were born
    at the same time. Three were still-born, two were born alive, and
    survived their birth but a short time. The mother, Margaret Waddington,
    aged twenty-one, was a poor woman of the township of Lower Darling,
    near Blackburn in Lancashire. This remarkable birth took place on the
    24th April, 1786, and was the subject of a communication to the Royal
    Society, which contained also the result of an investigation into
    similar cases which could be well authenticated, and which may be seen
    in a note in the admirable Catalogue of the College Museum, vol. v. pp.
    177-185. As the remarkable birth described by our correspondent N. D.
    took place five years previously to these inquiries, and is not
    mentioned, it is scarcely possible to doubt that his informant must be
    labouring under some great mistake. If such a birth took place, it is
    probable that the parish register will contain some record of the fact.
    Our correspondent will, perhaps, take the trouble to make some further
    investigations, so as to trace the source of the error, for error there
    must be, in the statement of his informant.]

GEORGE HERBERT AND BEMERTON CHURCH.

It is gratifying to see that some of your correspondents are taking, an
interest in the "worthy, lowly, and lovely" (as Isaac Walton called him)
Mr. George Herbert (Vol. ii., pp. 103. 414.). It may tend to increase that
interest, if I send you a note I made a few years ago, when I visited
Bemerton, and had the pleasure of officiating within the walls of that
celebrated little church. The rector kindly showed me the whole Parsonage
House; the parts rebuilt by Herbert were traceable; but the inscription set
up by him on that occasion is not there, nor had it been found, viz.:

     "TO MY SUCCESSOR.

 "If thou chance for to find,
  A new house to thy mind,
    And built without thy cost;
  Be good to the poor,
  As God gives the store,
    And then my labour's not lost."

It may truly be said to stand near the chapel (as his biographer calls it),
being distant only the width of the road, thirty-four feet, which in
Herbert's time was forty feet, as the building shows. On the south is a
grass-plat sloping down to the river, whence is a beautiful view of Sarum
Cathedral in the distance. A very aged fig-tree grows against the end of
the house, and a medlar in the garden, both, traditionally, planted by
Herbert.

The whole length and breadth of the church is forty-five feet by eighteen.
The south and west windows are of the date called Decorated, say 1300. They
are two-light windows, and worthy of imitation. The east window is modern.
The walls have much new brickwork and brick buttresses, after the manner
recommended in certain _Hints to Churchwardens_, Lond. 1825. A little
square western turret contains an ancient bell of the fourteenth century
(diameter, twenty-four inches), the daily sound of which used to charm the
ploughmen from their work, that they "might offer their devotions to God
with him."

    "Note, it was a saying of his 'That his time spent in prayer and
    cathedral music elevated his soul, and was his heaven upon
    earth.'"--WALTON.

The doorway is Jacobean, as is the chest or parish coffer, and also the
pulpit canopy; the old sittings had long been removed. The font is
circular, of early English date, lined with lead, seventeen inches
diameter, by ten inches deep. The walls were (1841) very dilapidated.

It cannot but be a surprise to every admirer of George Herbert and to all
visitors to this highly favoured spot, to find no monument whatever to the
memory of that bright example of an English parish priest. This fact need
surely only to be made known to insure ample funds for rebuilding the
little church, and "beautifying" it in all things as Herbert would desire
(he once did it "at his own cost"), retaining, if I may be allowed to
suggest, the decorated windows, with the font and bell, which, from my
Notes and Recollections, seem to be all that remains of what he must have
so often looked upon and cherished.

From the register I was permitted to extract this entry:

    "Mr. George Herbert, Esq., Parson, of Ffoughlston and Bemerton, was
    buried 3 day of March, 1632."

The _locus in quo_ is by this still left doubtful. May I, in conclusion,
add a quotation from Isaac Walton:

    "He lived and died like a saint, unspotted from the world, full of alms
    deeds, full of humility, and all the examples of a virtuous life. 'I
    wish (if God shall be so pleased) that I may be so happy as to die like
    him.'"

MINOR NOTES.

_Lord Mayor's Show in_ 1701.--Among the varieties which at different times
have graced the procession of the City on Lord Mayor's day, be pleased to
take the following from the _Post-boy_, Oct. 30. to Nov. 1. 1701:

    "The Maiden Queen who rid on the Lord Mayor's day in the pageant, in
    imitation of the Patroness of the Mercer's Company, had a fine suit of
    cloaths given her, valued at ninety guineas, a present of fifty
    guineas, four guineas for a smock, and a guinea for a pair of gloves."

Y. S.

_Sir Thomas Phillipps's Manuscripts._--Many inquiries are made in your
useful publication after books and authors, which may easily be answered by
the querist referring to the Catalogue of Sir Thomas Phillipps's
Manuscripts in the British Museum, the Society of Antiquaries, the
_Athenæum_, or the Bodleian Library.

T.

_Translation from Owen, &c._--I do not remember seeing in a subsequent
number of "NOTES AND QUERIES" any version of Owen's epigram, quoted by DR.
MAITLAND in No. 17. I had hoped RUFUS would have tried his hand upon it;
but as he has not, I send you a translation by an old friend of the
Doctor's, which has at least the merit of being a close one, and catching,
perhaps, not a little of the spirit of the original.

         "_Owen de Libro suo._

 "Oxoniæ salsus (juvenis tum) more vetusto
    Wintoniæque (puer tum) piperatus eram.
  Si quid inest nostro piperisve salisve libello,
    Oxoniense sal est, Wintoniense piper."

{461}

         "_Owen on his Book._

 "When fresh at Oxon I a salting got;
  At Winton I'd been pepper'd piping hot;
  If aught herein you find that's sharp and nice,
 'Tis Oxon's seasoning, and Winton's spice."

I subjoin also an epitaph[1] from the chapel of Our Ladye in Gloucester
Cathedral, translated by the same hand.

         "_Elizabetha loquitur._

 "Conjugis effigiem sculpsisti in marmore conjux
    Sic me immortalem te statuisse putas;
  Sed Christus fuerat viventi spesque fidesque
    Sic me mortalem non sinit esse Deus."

_Epigram on the late Bull_.--Pray preserve the following admirable epigram,

 "Cum Sapiente Pius nostras juravit in aras:

_Bailie Nicol Jarvie_ (Vol. ii., p. 421.).--When we spoke recently of
Charles Mackay, the inimitable Bailie Nicol Jarvie of one of the
Terryfications (though not by Terry) of Scott's _Rob Roy_ having made a
formal affidavit that he was a real "Edinburgh Gutter Bluid," we suspect
some of our readers themselves suspected a joke. The affidavit itself has,
however, been printed in the _Athenæum_, accompanied by an amusing
commentary, in which the document is justly pronounced "a very curious
one." Here it is:

    "At Edinburgh, the Fourteenth day of November, One thousand eight
    hundred and fifty years.

    "In presence of John Stoddart, Esq., one of Her Majesty's Justices of
    the Peace for the City of Edinburgh, appeared Charles Mackay, lately
    Theatre Royal, residing at number eleven Drummond Street, Edinburgh;
    who being solemnly sworn and examined depones, that he is a native of
    Edinburgh, having been born in one of the houses on the north side of
    the High Street of said city, in the month of October one thousand
    seven hundred and eighty-seven. That the deponent left Edinburgh for
    Glasgow when only about nine years of age, where he sojourned for five
    years; thence he became a wanderer in many lands, and finally settled
    once more in Edinburgh a few months before February eighteen hundred
    and nineteen years, when the drama of _Rob Roy_ was first produced in
    the Theatre Royal here. That the deponent by his own industry having
    realised a small competency, he is now residing in Edinburgh; and
    although upwards of threescore years old he finds himself 'hale and
    hearty,' and is one of the same class whom King Jamie denominates '_a
    real Edinburgh Gutter Bluid._' All which is truth, as the deponent
    shall answer to God.

_Hogs not Pigs_ (Vol. ii., p. 102.).--J. MN.'s remark on "hogs, lambs a
year old," reminds me that the origin of this rustical word still lingers
in the remote west, among the Irish and the Highland Gaels, whose
_gnath-bearla_, vernacular tongue, furnishes the neglected key of many a
dark chamber. The word to which I allude is "og," _adj._ young; whence
"ogan," a young man; "oige," a virgin.

In these islands we still apply the old French term "aver," _averium_, in
Guernsey, to the hog or pig; in Jersey, to a child. In France "aver"
denoted the animal produce or stock on a farm; and there were "averia
lanata" likewise. Similar apparently whimsical adaptations of words will
not shock those who are aware that "pig" in England properly means a little
fellow of the swine species, and that "pige" in Norse signifies a little
maid, a damsel.

_The Baptized Turk_.--Your correspondent CH. (Vol. ii., p. 120.), who
inquired about Lord Richard Christophilus (_al._ Isuf Bassa), a converted
Turk, may be interested in a curious account of another convert to
Christianity, which has lately fallen in my way, if he be not already in
possession of the (almost legendary) narrative. I allude to a small 8vo.
volume, entitled:

    "The Baptized Turk; or, A Narrative of the happy conversion of Signior
    Rigep Dandulo, the onely son of a silk merchant in the isle of Tsio,
    from the delusions of that great Impostor Mahomet, unto the Christian
    Religion; and of his admission unto Baptism, by Mr. Gunning at
    Excester-house Chappel, the 8th of November, 1657. Drawn up by Tho.
    Warmstry, D.D., Lond. 1658."

Dr. Warmstry was Dean of Worcester. His conversion of the Turk Dandulo is
mentioned in the _Lansdowne MSS._ (986., p. 67.), and also in the _Athenæ
Oxonienses_. The narrative is dedicated to

    "The Right Honourable the Countess of Dorset, the Honourable the Lord
    George, and the Worshipful Philip Warwick, Esq., _witnesses_ at the
    baptism of Signior Dandulo the convert."

There appears to have been "a picture of the said Dandulo in a Turkish
habit put before it;" {462} but this has been abstracted from the only copy
I have seen.

This conversion appears to have been effected by the instrumentality of a
dream; and the Narrative contains an interesting essay of some length on
the subject of visions, and gives an interpretation of the dream in
question.

Queries.

GRAY.--DRYDEN.--PLAYING CARDS.

Although my question regarding Gray and Dodsley's _Collection of Poems_ has
only been half answered, and my two Queries respecting Dryden's _Absolom
and Achitophel_ and _Essay on Satire_ not answered at all, I am not
discouraged from putting interrogatories on other matters, in the hope that
I may be more fortunate hereafter. On each of my former inquiries I have
still a word or two to say, and I do not know why I should not say them
now.

First, as to Gray and Dodsley:--Is the epithet _droning_, or _drony_, in
the first edition of the _Elegy_? and, as my copy of Dodsley's _Collection_
is dated 1748, and is said (on the half title, preceding the whole title)
to be "the _second_ edition," was there a _first_ edition in the same year,
or in an earlier year, or was there, in fact, no _first_ edition at all?
This question is important, because several poetical productions, of
undisputed excellence, originally made their appearance in Dodsley's
_Collection_.

Next, as to Dryden's _Absolom and Achitophel_: Is it known, or anywhere
stated, that it was printed early in the eighteenth century as a penny or
two-penny chap-book, and why was it so printed? Observe, too, that it was
unaccompanied by Tate's _Continuation_, which, as far as a lesson to the
lower orders is concerned, was of more consequence than Dryden's portion.
It is a circumstance I did not mention, but it is, nevertheless, worth a
Note, that in _The Key_ which follows the Address "to the Reader," in my
edition of 1708, the character of Zimri (which was given by Dryden himself
to the Duke of Buckingham) is assigned to Lord Gray, who was in truth the
Caleb of the performance. Is it to be taken that the publication of this
chap-book edition is merely a proof of the extreme popularity of Dryden's
half of the poem?

My third unanswered Query referred to the _Essay on Satire_, commonly
attributed to Lord Mulgrave and Dryden, but with which, as it seems to me,
for reasons there assigned, Lord Mulgrave could have nothing to do. As a
farther proof of Dryden's _sole authorship_, I may here add, what I have
since found, that the Addendum to the first volume of _State Poems_
consists of one thus entitled: "In opposition to Mr. Dryden's _Essay on
Satyr_," treating it as only his: it begins,

 "Now the reformer of the court and stage,
  The common beadle of this wilful age,
  Has with impartial hand whipp'd sovereign sin,
  In me it is but manners to begin."

It sounds drolly, in our day, to hear Dryden called "the reformer of the
court and stage," especially recollecting the attack upon him made just
afterwards by Jeremy Collier. Then, what are we to say to the subsequent
lines, attributed to Prior, which advert to the cudgelling Dryden received
in Rose Street for his attack upon Rochester. Prior calls his own
production _A Satire on the Modern Translators_, where he thus speaks of
Dryden under his name of Bayes:--

 "But what excuse, what preface can atone
  For crimes which guilty Bayes _has singly done_--
  Bayes, whose Rose Alley ambuscade enjoin'd
  To be to vices, which he practised, kind?"

All the contemporary evidence, with which I am acquainted, tends to
establish that Lord Mulgrave, instead of being the author of a satire which
Dryden improved and polished, had nothing in the world to do with it. Is
there any evidence, not contemporary, which shows the contrary? Surely
this, and the two other matters to which I have above adverted, are
interesting literary Queries.

Now to a subject that I care less about, and upon which I am entitled, from
his published works, to appeal to your correspondent, MR. S. W. SINGER. It
is a mere trifle, but upon a curious point--the history of playing cards,
which may, however, attract more attention than topics that relate only to
such insignificant men as Thomas Gray and John Dryden.

I have before me only four, out of what I presume originally consisted of
fifty-two playing cards, unlike any I have hitherto heard of. Each of them
illustrates a proverb, which is engraved at the bottom of a pictorial
representation of figures and objects, and the cards consist of the ten of
diamonds, the ace of hearts, the seven of hearts, and the eight of spades:
the number is in Roman figures at the left-hand corner, and the subject, a
diamond, heart, and spade, at the right-hand corner. I will briefly
describe them separately.

The proverb illustrated by the ten of diamonds is "Hee's in an ill case y^t
can finde no hole to creepe out at;" and the engraving (upon copper)
represents two men, with grey heads and in black gowns, in the pillory,
surrounded by soldiers armed with halberds, partisans, spears, &c., of
various shapes, and by a crowd of men in dresses of the seventeenth
century. The ace of hearts illustrates the proverb "Look before you leap;"
a man in a hat turned up at the sides is about to leap from a high bank
into the waters, wherein two others are already swimming: in the background
is a fifth man looking over the fence of a cottage. The seven of hearts has
engraved at the bottom of it, {463} "Patience on force is a medicine for a
mad horse;" and it represents the female keeper of a brothel receiving
whip-castigation at a cart's tail, a punishment frequently inflicted of old
upon women of that description, as many authors testify: soldiers with
halberds, &c., as before, march on either side of the cart, which at the
moment is passing a house with the sign of the Half-moon hanging out from
the wall by ornamented iron-work. The eight of spades is upon the proverb,
"Two of a trade can never agree;" and in the engraving, a couple of
fish-wives, who have thrown down their baskets of plaise, flounders, &c.,
are fighting furiously, while a man, behind, is obviously running away with
something he has stolen from them: the background consists of gable-ended
houses, part of a street.

These cards came to me from an old relative, who very likely once had the
whole pack, or _deck_, as it was formerly called; but I never could find
more than these four, and I have been unable to meet with, or hear of, any
others like them. From the costume and other circumstances, I am inclined
to think that they belong to the period of the Civil War, or rather later;
and I remember, some years ago, to have been shown twenty or thirty cards
of the latter end of the seventeenth century, founded upon public events,
one of them relating to the celebrated "Virgins of Taunton Dean," another
to the Death of Monmouth, &c. I shall be personally obliged by any
information respecting the cards I have described; and, since a distinct
Query may be desirable, I beg leave to ask any of your readers, whether
they know of the existence of any other cards belonging to the same set?

Minor Queries.

_Pretended Reprint of Ancient Poetry._--In a bookseller's catalogue (J.
Taylor, Blackfriars-road, 1824), I find mention of a work entitled _Sundrie
Pleasaunte Flowres of Poesie, newlie plucked from the Hill Parnasse the
hand of P. M., and verie goodlie to smelle_. It is said to have been
"Imprynted in London, in the yeare of our Lorde 1576," and "Reprinted by
Davidson, 1823." The bookseller's note records the fact, that "only TWO
COPIES were reprinted from the original supposed to be unique." I do not
believe that any work with the above title came from the press in the
sixteenth century. Query, Who was the enlightened individual who produced
the _two_ copies?

EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.

_The Jews' Spring Gardens._--In the newspaper called the _Postman_, Oct. 3.
to 6. 1702, I read,

    "At Milend the garden and house called _the Jews' Spring Garden_, is to
    be let. Enquire at Capt. Bendal's at Milend."

Can any of your readers, acquainted with the neighbourhood of London,
afford me information regarding this place, which was probably one of
amusement and promenade much used by the Jews, many of the wealthier of
whom, at that time and long afterwards, resided in Goodman's Fields?

one is to be found. There is not one either in the Bodleian or the British

_Whipping by Women._--In the accounts of the constable of this parish for
the year 1644, there are the following items:

   "Paid to two men for watching Ellen

   "Paid to a woman for whippinge y^e

   "Paid for beare for her after she was
  whipped                                  0 0 3."

as the use of _Benedicite_ was intended {464} to convey or invoke a
blessing, not an exhortation to bless.

scheme for the establishment of THE CHURCH HISTORY SOCIETY, given in your

proposal calculated to advance one of the most important branches of
historical learning," will you permit me to inquire, through the medium of
"NOTES AND QUERIES," whether DR. MAITLAND's scheme has met with so much
encouragement as to justify the expectation, and I will add the hope, that
it may ever be fully carried out?

LAICUS.

_Pope Ganganelli._--There was a _Life of Pope Clement XIV._ (Ganganelli)
published in London in 1785. It was a distinct work from that by
Caraccioli. Can any of your readers inform me of the author's name; or is
there any one who has seen the book, or can tell where a copy may be found?

_Sir George Downing._--I should be glad to obtain any information
respecting Sir George Downing, of East Halley, Cambridgeshire, and

II. to the States-General of Holland, secretary to the Treasury, and the
statesman who caused the "Appropriation Act" to be passed, the 17th of
Charles II. The family is of most ancient origin in Devonshire, and I have
heard that a portrait of him is possessed by some person in that county.

_Solemnization of Matrimony._--In the service of the Church for this
occasion, on the ring being placed upon the woman's finger, the man is
prescribed to say: "With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship,
and _with all my worldly goods I thee endow_," &c. How is this last
sentence to be reconciled with the law? or is the vow to be considered
revocable?

_Passage in Bishop Butler._--In Bishop Butler's sermon "Upon the Government
of the Tongue" occurs the following passage:

    "There is in some such a disposition to be talking, that an offence of
    the slightest kind, and such as would not raise any other resentment,
    yet raises, if I may so speak, the resentment of the tongue, puts it
    into a flame, into the most ungovernable motions. _This outrage, when
    the person it respects is present, we distinguish in the lower rank of
    people by a peculiar term._"

Now I should be glad if any one could offer a conjecture as to the Bishop's
meaning in this last sentence? I have shown it to several people, but no
one has been able to think of this "peculiar term."

your readers be kind enough to enlighten a provincial ignoramus by
answering the following Queries:--

1. Which is the best and most complete English translation of Erasmus'
_Colloquies_?

2. Is there an English translation of Apuleius' _Golden Ass_?

3. Is the French translation of the latter work considered a good one?

_The Molten Sea._--In 1835, Captain J. B. Jervis, of the Bombay Engineers,
published at Calcutta an essay, entitled _Records of Ancient Science_, in
which he endeavours to reconcile the discrepancy between the 1 Kings, vii.
23. 26. and the 2 Chron. iv. 2. 5. by proving that a vessel of oblate
spheroidal form--of 30 cubits in the periphery, and 10 cubits in the major
axis--would (according to the acknowledged relation of the bath to the
cubit) hold exactly 2,000 baths liquid measure, and 3,000 baths when filled
and heaped up conically with wheat (as specified in Ezekiel, xlv. 11.).

I do not possess any means of criticising this explanation of the
difficulty, and having searched in various modern commentaries for a notice
of it without success, I venture to submit it in your columns to the
attention of others.

_"Sedem Animæ", &c._--Will any of your correspondents inform me where the
following quotation is taken from:--

 "Sedem animæ in extremis digitis habent."

It will be found in Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_, folio edition (7th),
p. 55., and in the 8vo. edition of 1837, vol. iv. p. 80. Burton cites it as
from Sallust, but the verbal index of that author has been consulted in
vain for it.

_Old St. Pancras Church._--Old St. Pancras has always been a noted
burial-place for Roman Catholics that reside in or near London; and it has
been assigned as a reason for that being their mausoleum and cemetery, that
prayers and mass are said daily in a church dedicated to the same saint, in
the south of France, for the repose of the souls of the faithful whose
bodies are deposited in the church of St. Pancras near London (England),
where crosses and Requiescat in Pace, or the initial of those words,
R.I.P., are found on the sepulchral monuments. It is said prayer and mass
{465} are said at St. Peter at Rome, also for the same purpose.

Can any of your readers inform me where that church is in the south of
France; and when such prayers and masses were first said?

It is also understood that this church was the last whose bell tolled in
England for mass, and in which any rites of the Roman Catholic religion
were celebrated after the Reformation.

HOLME MSS.--THE CRADOCKS.

(Vol. ii., p. 429.).

In answer to the Query of MR. ELLACOMBE, "I should like to know whether the
MSS. of Randle Holme, of Chester, 1670, which afterwards were penes Dr.
Latham, are still accessible?"

1. The MSS. alluded to are those of _four_ successive antiquaries of that
name, of whom an account will be found in Ormerod's _Hist. Chesh._, vol.
ii., under "Tranmere."

2. The person intended was _not_ Dr. Latham, but Mr. William Latham, of
Eltham, afterwards of Quenby Hall, Leicestershire, _brother_ of Dr. Latham,
_of Romsey_, the naturalist.

3. The Holme MSS. were _never_ in the possession of Mr. Latham, but if MR.
ELLACOMBE will refer to Dr. Gower's prospectus, reissued by Mr. Latham in
1800, he will find a correct statement of their having been obtained by
Bishop Gastrell for the Earl of Oxford, and "eventually for the mighty
emolument of the public." (p. 40.)

4. These MSS. (being part of the Harleian Collection), _are accessible_ to
visitors of the reading room at the Museum, and extend, in the Harleian
Catalogue, from No. 1920. to No. 2180. inclusive.

5. With respect to _Cradocks_, as connected with Cheshire, Mr. E. will find
notice in Ormerod's _Hist. Chesh._, iii. 236., of the tomb of Sir John
Cradock in Nantwich Church, as lately, and perhaps now, remaining, and an
account of its _former_ state in Chaloner's and Holme's _Church Notes_,
Harl. MSS. 2151., and in _Ordinary of Arms in King's Vale Royall_, 1656,
arms assigned to Cradock:--"Argent, on a chevron azure three garbs, or.
Partridge (_Hist. of Nantwich_, 1773) names him Sir David, and states that
the arms were not _then_ discoverable." Platt's later _History_ quotes
Derrick's _Letters_ for naming him Sir Roger.

The pedigree of NEWTON, previously CRADOCK, will be found at length in
Lewys Dwnn's _Visitation of Wales_ (vol. i. p. 145.), published by the late
Sir Samuel Meyrick, under the auspices of the Welsh MSS. Society. It places
Newton in Pembrokeshire, and differs in some other respects from MR.
ELLACOMBE'S account. The entry was made in 39 Eliz., 1597, and the close of
the pedigree, translated into English, is as follows:

ANTIQUITY OF SMOKING.

In Vol. ii., p. 286., an allusion is made by a correspondent to the
following verses of the comic poet Crobylus, in reference to the antiquity
of smoking:

  [Greek: A. "Egô de pros ta therma tauth' huperbolêi]
    [Greek: Tous daktulous dêpouthen idaious echô,]
    [Greek: Kai ton larung' hêdista puriô temachiois.]

  [Greek: B. "Kaminos, ouk anthrôpos."]
                      Athen I. p. 5. F.

The two last verses are thus rendered in the passage referred to:

 "And I will sweetly burn my throat with cuttings;
  A chimney, not a man."

Athenæus is describing the fondness of the ancient gourmands for eating
their food extremely hot. As they had no forks, but, like the modern
Orientals, carried their food to their mouth with their fingers, one
Pithyllus used gloves in order to avoid burning his fingers. (_Ib._ I. p.
6. D.)

In the second line there is a pun upon the word [Greek: idaios] which is
explained to mean "cold"--the allusion being to the Idæan Dactyli. (See
Meineke, _Fragm. Com. Gr._, vol. iv. p. 568. Lobeck, _Aglaoph_. p. 1181.)
The passage is to be translated thus:

A. My fingers are fire-proof against these exceedingly hot morsels, and I
delight in burning my throat with slices of fish.

B. "A furnace, not a man."

In v. 3. [Greek: puriô] is the word properly applied to steaming in a
vapour-bath; and [Greek: temachos] or [Greek: temachôn] is a slice or
cutlet of fish. (See Aristoph. _Nub._ 339.) In v. 4. [Greek: kaminos] must
not be rendered "chimney". It is a furnace or oven, and not even a stove or
hearth, as Scott and Liddell remark in v. The ancient Greeks, and probably
the Romans likewise, were unacquainted with chimneys. (See Beckmann, _Hist.
of Inventions_, art. "Chimneys," and Smith's _Dict. of Greek and Rom.
Ant._, art. "House".) The meanings of the Latin word _caminus_ are
explained by Beckmann (_Ib._, vol. i. p. 301. ed. Bohn). The short poem of
[Greek: kaminos ê keramis], attributed to Homer (_Epig._ 14.), illustrates
the meaning of the word [Greek: kaminos]. In these verses it is a furnace
used for baking pottery.

ANTIQUITAS SÆCULI JUVENTUS MUNDI.

(Vol. ii., pp. 218. 350. 295.).

The aphorism, "Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi," which occurs in the
_Treatise de Augm. Scient._, vol. viii. p. 39., and in the _Advancement of
Learning_, vol. ii. p. 46., ed. Montagne, may be safely attributed to Lord
Bacon himself, though it is printed in both passages in the form of
quotation, between inverted commas.

In the _Novum Organum_, lib. i. aph. 83, the thought appears in this form:

    "De antiquitate autem, opinio quam homines di ipsâ fovent. negligens
    omnino est, et vix verbo ipsi congrua. _Mundi enim senium et
    grandævitas pro antiquitate vere habenda sunt_; quæ temporibus nostris
    tribui debent, non juniori ætati mundi, qualis apud antiquos fuit. Illa
    enim ætas, respectu nostri, antiqua et major; respectu mundi ipsius,
    nova et minor fuit."

The pointed and aphoristic form of the thought is due to Bacon; the thought
itself has, however, been traced by Dr. Whewell to Giordano Bruno.

    "It is worthy of remark, that a thought which is often quoted from
    Francis Bacon, occurs in Bruno's _Cena di Cenere_, published in 1584; I
    mean the notion, that the later times are more aged than the earlier.
    In the course of the dialogue, the Pedant, who is one of the
    interlocutors, says, 'In antiquity is wisdom;' to which the
    philosophical character replies, 'If you knew what you were talking
    about, you would see that your principle leads to the opposite result
    of that which you wish to infer; I mean, that _we_ are older and have
    lived longer than our predecessors.' He then proceeds to apply this, by
    tracing the course of astronomy through the earlier astronomers up to
    Copernicus."--_Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_, vol. ii. p. 361.

The _Advancement of Learning_ was published in 1605, twenty-one years after
the Treatise of Bruno. Mr. Hallam (_History of Europe_, vol. iv. p. 92.)
treats the thought as the original property of Bacon; and although the
first trace of it is to be found in Bruno, there is no improbability in
supposing that it occurred independently to Bacon about the same time.

_Bacon's Advancement in Learning_ (Vol. ii., p. 396.).--The writer in
"NOTES AND QUERIES" speaks of the English text as being original, and the
Latin a version of Lord Bacon's _Instauratio Magna_; is he not mistaken? In
reality there were two originals of that work, as we learn from Mallet's
account prefixed to the folio edition of Bacon's works in 4 vols. London,
1740, p. xvii. et seq. (vol. first). The first edition was in English,
London, 1605, and is to be found in the Bodleian. The Latin, published in
1623, is said by Mallet to be the work of Bacon himself, with the
assistance of some friends, after he had enlarged and corrected the
original; it is from this that Wats' version is made, which is very exact
and faithful to its original. The title-page is engraved on copper by
Marshall, with this inscription:

    "INSTAVR. MAG. P. I. OF THE ADVANCEMENT AND PROFICIENCE OF LEARNING or
    the PARTITIONS OF SCIENCES, I[=X] Bookes, Written in Latin by the Most
    Eminent, Illustrious, and Famous LORD FRANCIS BACON, Baron of Verulam,
    Vicont St. Alban, Counsilour of Estate, and Lord Chancellor of England,
    Interpreted by GILBERT WATS, OXFORD: Printed by Leon. Lichfield,
    Printer to the Vniversity, for Rob. Young and Ed. Forrell,
    CI[C*]I[C*]CXL."

The passage referred to is at p. 36.:

    "Indeed, to speak truly, _Antiquitas seculi juventus mundi_, certainly
    our times are the ancient times, when the world is now ancient, and not
    those which we count ancient, _ordine retrogrado_, by a computation
    backward from our own times."

Now this agrees exactly with Bacon's original Latin in Mallet's edition,
vol. i. p. 43., except that ordine retrogrado is not in Italics; but in
Bacon's English text (Mallet's edition, vol ii. p. 431.), the coincidence
in all respects is complete:

    "And to speak truly, Antiquitas sacculi, (_sic_) juventus mundi. These
    times are the ancient times when the world is ancient, and not those
    which we account ancient _ordine retrogrado_, by a computation backward
    from ourselves."

Wats' version is the more exact of the two.

ALBEMARLE, TITLE OF.

(Vol. ii., p. 442.).

In reply to the question of J., I send you some particulars about _Aumerle_
or Albemarle.

The first Earl of this place, which is the name of a small town or
territory in Normandy, was Otho, descended from the Earls of Champagne, and
nearly related to William the Conqueror, to whom he fled for protection,
having killed a great person in that country, and obtained this earldom and
the Isle of Holderness, in Yorkshire, for his maintenance. The title
remained in the heirs of Otho till the death of William, eighth Earl of
Albemarle, 44th Henry III., when it reverted to the Crown, with the
lordship of Holderness, and in the 9th of Richard II. he granted them to
Thomas of Woodstock, summoned to parliament as "Thomas, Duke of Albemarle,
the king's loving uncle."

Without enumerating the different persons upon whom our kings subsequently
conferred this title as often as it became extinct or vacant, it will be
sufficient for our purpose to show, that at the Restoration the dukedom of
Albemarle was given to General Monk, who, according to Banks (_D. and E.
Peerage_, vol. iii. p. 37.), had a certain degree of hereditary pretension
to the name {467} by which he was ennobled, inasmuch as he was descended
from Margaret, eldest daughter and co-heir of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of
Warwick and Albemarle; but this is not satisfactorily made out in Banks'
table. At all events, the dukedom became again extinct on the death of
Christopher Monk, the second Duke of Albemarle, in 1688, S.P.; but the name
was once more revived in 1695-6, by William III., in favour of Arnold Joort
Van Keppel, Lord of Voorst, who had attended the king in several campaigns,
and was his Master of the Robes, and on the 10th of February in that year
created "_Earl of Albemarle in Normandy_;" the title having been doubtless
selected as one so frequently enjoyed by persons of the highest
consideration, and not in any way resting upon an hereditary claim.

Replies to Minor Queries.

_Cromwell Poisoned_ (Vol. ii., p. 393.).--Your correspondent P. T. queries
if there be any other statement than that which he adduces respecting
Cromwell having been poisoned. I would refer him to the _Athenæ Oxoniensis_
of Anthony à Wood, vol. ii. p. 303.,[2] in which it is stated that Dr.
George Bate's friends gave him credit for having given a baneful dose to
the Protector, to ingratiate himself with Charles II. Amidst all the
mutations of those changeful times, and whether Charles I., Cromwell, or
Charles II. were in the ascendant, Dr. George Bate always contrived to be
the chief state physician. In Whitelock's _Memorials of the English
Affairs_ (1732), p. 494, it appears that the Parliament, in 1651, ordered
Dr. Bate to go into Scotland to attend the General (Cromwell), and to take
care of his health; he being his usual physician in London, and well
esteemed by him. He wrote a work styled _Elenchus Motuum nuperorum in
Angliâ_. This was severely scrutinised in another, entitled _Elenchus
Elenchi; sive Animadversiones in Georgii Batei, Cromwelli Paricidæ,
aliquando Protomedici, Elenchi Motuum nuperorum in Angliâ. Autore Robt.
Pugh; Parisiis, 1664_.

Dr. Bate, who died 19th April, 1669, was buried at Kingston upon Thames.

"_Never did Cardinal bring Good to England_" (Vol. ii., pp. 424,
450.).--BERUCHINO is right in his suggestion that Dr. Lingard may
accidentally have omitted a reference to the place from whence he really
derived this saying; for Hall tells us in his _Chronicle_ (ed. 1809, p.
758.), that

    "Charles, Duke of Suffolke, seeing the delay, gave a great clappe on
    the table with his hande and said, 'By the masse, now I see that the
    olde saied sawe is true, _that there was never Legatt nor Cardinall
    that did good in Englande_.'"

Whether Charles Brandon was a reader of _Piers Ploughman_, I know not; but
the following passage from that poem proves he was giving expression to a
feeling which had long been popular in this country. I quote from Mr.
Wright's edition, published by Pickering:

 "I knew nevere Cardinal
  That he ne cam fra the Pope;
  And we clerkes, whan thei come,
  For hir comunes paieth,
  For hir pelure and hir palfreyes mete,
  And pilours that hem folweth.

 "The comune _clamat cotidie_
  Ech a man til oother,
  _The contree is the corseder_
  _That Cardinals comme inne_;
  And ther thei ligge and lenge moost,
  Lecherie there regneth."

                  L. 13789--13800.

Mr. Wright observes in a note upon this passage, that "the contributions
levied upon the clergy for the support of the Pope's messengers and agents
was a frequent subject of complaint in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries."

    "Gingroen (gin-croen) _s. f._, the toad-flax, a kind of stinking
    mushroom."--Owen's _Welsh Dictionary_.

There is, however, some mistake (a high authority informs me) in the
explanation given in the dictionary. Toad-flax is certainly not a
"mushroom," neither does it "stink." Is the Welsh word applied to both
equivocally as distinct {468} objects? In Withering's _Arrangement of
British Plants_, 7th edit., vol. iii., p. 734., 1830, the Welsh name of
_Antirrhinum Sinaria_, or common yellow toad-flax, is stated to be
_Gingroen fechan_.

_Modum Promissionis_ (Vol. ii., pp 279. 347.).--Your correspondent C. H.
has not solved my difficulty as to _modum promissionis_. In the hope that
he, or others, will still kindly endeavour to do so, I subjoin the context
in which it stands:--

    "Noluit Jethro legem posteris figere: sed, quoad quietam stationem
    adeptus esset populus, remedium præsentibus incommodis, atque (ut vulgo
    loquitur) modum promissionis ostendit."

An old French translation renders it:--

    "Il n'a point donc voulu mettre loy pour la posterité: mais seulement
    remedier aux incommoditez presentes _par maniére de provision_ (comme
    on dit)," &c.

The general import of the passage is, that Jethro's counsel to Moses, as to
the appointment of rulers over the people, was not intended to apply to
Canaan, but only to their sojourn in the wilderness.

I do not see how the "formula professionis monasticæ" helps us; unless,
indeed, "modus promissionis" were a kind of temporary and conditional vow,
which does not appear in Ducange.

_First Earl of Roscommon_ (Vol. ii., p. 325.).--There was, in the
burying-ground of Kilkenny-West, some thirty-five years or more ago, an old
tombstone belonging to the Dillon Family, on which was traced the genealogy
of the Roscommon branch from one of the sons of the first earl (if I
remember right, the third or fourth), down to a Thomas, who had, I have
heard my father say, a son called Garrett, who had issue two sons, Patrick
and Thomas. Patrick was always, in that part of the country, _considered
the heir_ to this title. Patrick and Thomas had issue, (living or dead I
know not), but should imagine dead; as, had they been living, they would no
doubt have come forward when the late earl claimed the title, as he claimed
it as being descended from the youngest son of the first earl, whereas
Patrick and Thomas were certainly the descendants of one of the elder sons
of the first earl; and therefore, had the sons of either Patrick or Thomas
come forward, it would no doubt have been decided in their favour. On this
account, it was several years before the late earl's claim was fully
confirmed, as it was thought that some of the descendants of the elder
branches might come forward. This would have attracted my attention earlier
had I not been abroad.

_Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties_, London, 1831, (art. Barry, p.
159.) it is stated that:

    "The picture was painted in his twentieth or twenty-first year, on the
    baptism by St. Patrick of one of the kings of Cashel, who stands
    unmoved while the ceremony is performed, amidst a crowd of wondering
    spectators; although the saint, in setting down his crosier, has,
    without perceiving it, struck its iron point through the royal foot."

ESTE.

_Becket_ (Vol. ii., pp. 106. 270. 364.).--It so happens that, before
seeing, MR. VENABLES' communication, with his quotations from the
_Monasticon_ (Vol. ii., p. 364), I had taken an opportunity of looking into
a friend's copy of that work, and had there found what seems to be a key to
the origin of the designation "_St. Thomas of Acon_ or _Acres_." It is
stated, in a quotation from Bp. Tanner, that

    "The hospital [in Cheapside] consisted of a master and several
    brethren, professing the rule of St. Austin, but were of a particular
    order, which was about this time instituted in the Holy Land, viz.
    _Militiæ Hospitales S. Thomæ Martyris Cantuariensis de Acon_, being a
    branch of the Templars."--_Monast._ vi. 646.

and the same title occurs in the charter of Edward III. (_ibid._) Now it
appears to me that the words _de Acon_ here relate, not to the saint, but
to the order which took its name from him; and this view is confirmed by
the passage which Mr. VENABLES quotes from _Matthew of Westminster_, as to
the foundation of a chapel in honour of St. Thomas, at Acre, in Syria, A.
D. 1190. It is easy to suppose that in course of time, especially when the
origin of the designation had been cast into the shade by the cessation of
the Crusades, and the ruin of the great order to which the brethren of St.
Thomas were at first attached, the patron himself may have come to be
styled _de Acon_ or _of Acres_: and this seems to be the case in the Act of
23 Hen. VI. (_Monast._ vi. 247.)

Allow me to ask a question as to another point in the history of Becket.
Among his preferments is said to have been the parish of "St. Mary
_Littory_ or _ad Litters_," which is commonly supposed to mean St.
Mary-le-Strand.[3] My friend Mr. Foss, in his elaborate work on _The Judges
of England_, contradicts this, on the ground that there was then no parish
of that name; and he supposes St. Mary-at-Hill to be intended. Now the
words _ad Litters_ would be alike applicable as a description in either
case but it appears to me that, if the city church were meant, it would be
styled, as it usually is, _ad Montem_, and that _ad Litters_ is Latin for
_le Strand_. Was there not then an ancient church so called, until the
demolitions of Protector Somerset in that quarter? And is not the common
belief as to Becket's parish correct? I ask in great ignorance, but not
without having vainly searched some books from which information might have
been expected.

_Aërostation_ (Vol. ii., pp. 199. 317. 380.).--I happen to remember a few
old verses of a squib on Lunardi, which may be enough seasoned with the
dust of oblivion to interest some of your readers.

 "Good folks, can you believe your eyes?
    Vincenzo di Lunardi
  Has made a voyage to the skies,
    That foreigner foolhardy!

 "He went up in a round baloon
    (For moon is luna, Latin),
  To pay a visit to the moon;
    A basket-boat he sat in.

 "And side by side the moon, he cried

 "Now after all remains to tell

Perhaps some of your correspondents could supply the remaining stanzas. I
fancy there were several more. As far as I can remember, they chiefly
related to M. Lunardi's conversation with the moon, which, involving some
political allusions, did not so much hit my youthful imagination at the
time. When a boy, I have frequently heard my father repeat the lines.

    "_The Pheliebeg._ Thomas Rawlinson, an iron-smelter and an Englishman,
    was the person who, about or prior to A. D. 1728, introduced the
    pheliebeg, or short kilt, worn in the Highlands. This fact, very little
    known, is established in a letter from Ewan Baillie, of Oberiachan,
    inserted in the _Edinburgh Magazine_ for 1785, and also by the Culloden
    Papers."

The writer of that work, and of that _daring_ statement, was, I have been
informed, a Scottish military gentleman of the name of Hamilton. This
origin of the kilt is also mentioned by Mr. Robert Chambers in his _Life of
Duncan Forbes, of Culloden_. See his _Biographical Dictionary of Eminent

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Mr. Bohn has just issued a new volume of his Antiquarian Library; and we
shall be greatly surprised if it does not prove one of the most popular of
the whole series. It is a new and greatly enlarged edition of Mr.
Keightley's _Fairy Mythology illustrative of the Romance and Superstition
of various Countries_, a work characterised alike by a quick perception of
the beauty of the popular myths recorded in its pages, the good taste
manifested in their selection, and the learning and scholarship with which
Mr. Keightley has illustrated them. The lovers of folk-lore will be
delighted with this new edition of a book, which such men as Goethe, Grimm,
Von Hammer, Douce, and Southey have agreed in commending; and of which the
appearance is particularly well timed, for a fitter book for fire-side
reading, or a Christmas present, we know not than this edition of
Keightley's _Fairy Mythology_, with its inimitable frontispiece by George
Cruikshank, which alone is worth the price of the volume.

Whitaker's _Clergyman's Diary and Ecclesiastical Calendar_ is intended to
supply a want which is acknowledged to have been long felt by the clergy,
though the lawyer and man of business have been for many years well
supplied with works of a similar character. A glance at the Table of
Contents shows how much valuable matter, of especial interest to our
clerical friends, has here been collected from various sources for their
information; and to prove the value of a work destined, we have no doubt,
to find for many years an extensive and well-deserved patronage.

Few of our readers but have tested and found the value of Mrs. Cowden
Clarke's _Concordance to Shakspeare_; and few are the nurseries into which
some of her clever and kindly books for children have not found their way;
so that albeit her projected series of tales, _The Girlhood of Shakspeare's
Heroines_, scarcely belongs to the class of works usually noticed in our
columns, we gladly find in Mrs. Clarke's love of children and reverence for
Shakspeare, an excuse for saying a few words in favour of her good work of
tracing the probable antecedents in the history of some of Shakspeare's
heroines.

THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CONTROVERSY.--At the present crisis, when the
extraordinary aggression of Pope Pius IX. on the rights of the Church and
Sovereign of England renders a thorough acquaintance with the Roman
Catholic Controversy most essential, the Council of the PARKER SOCIETY are
desirous of calling public attention to the WORKS of the REFORMERS which
they have issued.

These are the writings of Archbishop Cranmer, two vols.; Bishop Ridley,
Latimer, two vols.; Coverdale, two vols.; Jewel, three vols. completed, the
fourth nearly ready; also those of Tyndale, three vols.; Becon, three
vols., &c.

The annual subscription to the Society is 1l., to be paid in advance, for
which each member receives four volumes. In the concluding volume of Bishop
Jewel's works will appear, among other treatises, his "View of a Seditious
Bull," being that issued by Pius V. against Queen Elizabeth. The
republication of this will be felt to be most seasonable at the present
time, and the complete answers furnished by the Romanisers to all the
Romish doctrines and assumptions will be found of the greatest interest and
use.

The Council are anxious to facilitate as far as possible the desire of the
Clergy and others to possess these important works; and as they have on
hand copies of some of the authors named, they are prepared to dispose of
these on reasonable terms. Application may be made to W. Thomas, Esq., 33.
Southampton Street, Strand.

It is particularly requested that the members will pay their subscriptions
for 1851 as early as possible. As the series of publications is is now
drawing to a close, this announcement is important, and the Council will
feel greatly obliged by attention to it.

    "This work is not so much a history of the Greek Church generally, as
    of that one most important feature in her career, the long protracted
    struggle with the Western Church, which terminated in their unhappy
    separation. The Author's investigation into the conflicting causes
    which led to this result is ably carried out, with considerable
    research, and great lucidity of style."--_Ecclesiastic._

*** This voluminous history of Europe (each vol. containing upwards of 1000
pages) was compiled from substantial information received at the time, and,
as such, is worthy of the historian's reference; some of the curious
portraits and historical prints fall into the English series.

    Complete sets like the above are very seldom met.

SISMONDI, Histoire des Français, 18 vols. 8vo., complete, sewed, only 3l.
3s. 1847-49.

    The best History of France is undoubtedly that of the learned Sismondi,
    who diligently studied all the Original Sources, and guided by a sound
    critical judgment, and by liberal political views, produced a work
    which supersedes all other rivals. Sismondi's style is noble and vivid:
    he gives life to every character he describes.

    Many pages of Sismondi illustrate English History, and of all the
    French Historians he is the most honest and candid with regard to this
    country.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
