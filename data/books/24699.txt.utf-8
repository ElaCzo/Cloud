                        BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE


Edward Gamaliel Janeway was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, August
31, 1841. He was graduated from Rutgers College in 1860, receiving the
degree of B.A. and M.A. from that institution. In 1864 he was graduated
from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, receiving the
degree of M.D. Later in life, the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon
him, by Rutgers in 1898, by Columbia in 1904, and by Princeton in 1907.
While in the medical school in the years 1862 and 1863, he was made
acting medical cadet in the United States Army hospitals at Newark, New
Jersey.

He began to practise medicine in New York City where he continued and
ended his professional career. In 1869, he became professor of pathology
and practical anatomy in Bellevue Hospital Medical College, continuing
in that capacity until 1876. From 1868 to 1871 he was visiting physician
to Charity Hospital. In 1871 he became visiting physician to Bellevue
Hospital where he remained for many years and where, in the pathological
department, he won such distinction. He later became visiting and
consulting physician to other hospitals in the city.

In 1874 he was vice-president of the New York Pathological Society. From
1875 till 1882, he was Health Commissioner of New York. In 1876 he was
president of the New York Medical Journal Association. His principal
contributions to medical literature appear in the medical journals of
New York.

He was president of the Academy of Medicine in 1897 and 1898 and a
trustee from 1899 until 1903.

He died in Summit, New Jersey, on February 10, 1911.



                          IN MEMORIAM


On April 6, 1911, the Fellows of the New York Academy of Medicine met to
honour his memory and to give reverent tribute to the sum of his
accomplishments as Pathologist, Sanitarian and Physician.



                            Some
                   Personal Recollections of
                         Dr. Janeway




I


What it is that has kept urging me to write down these recollections of
Edward Gamaliel Janeway, the physician, would indeed be rather hard to
define, but the desire to record a little something of what I had
personally come to know of this unusual man made itself felt very
shortly after his death, now over five years ago. Since that time this
feeling--steadily growing--seems irresistibly to have drawn me on to
this endeavour to add some little part to the perpetuation of his
memory--this man, who without pretence held the reputation of--one stops
to take a breath before writing it--the reputation of being the best
diagnostician in the world.

If by some happy chance these pen-pictured glimpses should bear some
likeness to the man--if they should bring out here and there a line or
colour which will recall some characteristic, show some quality, reveal
some trait which, for those who knew him, will help to keep his memory
fresh, they will have earned for themselves a very good reward. But
beyond this, if they should fall to the notice of a younger generation
and, more especially, to those choosing the profession of the physician,
and the reader can discern therein something of the man himself, can get
some glimpse of his life and its meaning, can gain some sense of the
sincerity, the simplicity, the self-sacrifice and singleness of purpose
which guided him and finally lifted him so far out of and above the
ordinary, then will the pleasant task of recalling fully justify this
venturesome effort.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in the midst of my medical schooldays and in the unrestraint of
Adirondack holidays twenty years ago that I first met Dr. Janeway. As I
look back at this first memory I can see a vigorous, well-built man a
little way on in the fifties, dressed for a mountain climb or a game of
golf. His fine, firm-featured face would have struck one as rather stern
if one happened to miss that blessed kindliness which always lighted his
steady eyes. Though dressed for outing, it was not difficult to see by a
brief study of his face that his choice of exercise was intellectual
rather than physical, yet he went to his game or his walk with the same
directness of purpose with which he went to his work.

Ordinary social intercourse was an effort for him. It seemed as if he
had to focus his mind down to the mental horizon of the everyday world
of everyday people around him, yet he did not appear impatient of the
small talk going on about him so long as it was plain he was not to take
part in it himself.

One characteristic which never failed to impress those who met him was
his reserve. It was the quality of it which was so striking. It was not
a reserve which was raised of aloofness; there was no particle of that,
no self-esteem, no egoism--common builders of reserve--yet on the other
hand it was not the retreat of shyness as many might have thought,
though out of it a certain constraint was undoubtedly born. One might
almost say it was a result rather than a reserve; the result of a
something hard at work within; a preoccupying something; a gestating
something, the offspring of which was--well--what _he_ was.

Another quality which leaves itself deep carved in the memory of these
early days of acquaintance was the quiet, unconscious respect he seemed,
with equal unconsciousness, to inspire in all about him; and more, even
in those who in kinship and friendship were closest to him, and with a
constancy which never wavered. In those days only the more evident
traits of his character came home to me. It was rather by feeling, by
intuition, that he impressed me. I had no measure of my own with which
to estimate his mental attainments. I had a kind of awe, of hero-worship
in knowing him, which left me reticent in the discussion of any medical
matters with him--so I usually stuck in those days to safer subjects.

It was not until two or three years later, after I was graduated, that I
had any association of a professional nature with him. It was near the
end of the summer, up in the mountains. An elderly lady, a member of a
well-known family, was suddenly taken ill. I was hurriedly called to see
her, and on arriving at her cottage was told that Dr. Janeway had been
sent for also and would be there soon; but they were anxious to have me
go to the patient at once. The state of excitement into which this, my
first professional call, threw me, was in itself enough without the
crushing thought of what the great man might think of me, a then
full-fledged M.D. I was ushered into the bedroom where she lay, totally
unconscious and breathing heavily. As I hastened to the house, I had
been formulating in my mind just the questions I should put to her--for
I had learned in the medical school how to take a careful history--and
there she lay without speech, without hearing, and without response. As
I stood looking at her I could feel, rather than see, the family
anxiously crowding about the doorway, waiting for me to tell them just
what the trouble was, how serious it was, what were the chances of her
recovery. At that moment I wondered why I had ever thought of studying
medicine. I sat down by the bedside and felt her pulse. Why was she
unconscious? I tried to think of all the things which caused a state of
unconsciousness. Suppose she should die before I could think of what the
trouble was, and before I could do anything to save her life! The
thought was staggering! And then as I looked down at the patient again
I realized, alas, that my chance of making a diagnosis to give to the
family and then to proudly repeat it to Dr. Janeway, had vanished--for
at that moment the doctor's voice could be heard outside the door and
the next he was quietly stepping into the room. As he came forward, I
stood aside to give him my place at the bedside. He asked one or two
simple questions which I was fortunately able to answer. As I look back,
I feel sure he did this to put me at my ease. This was the first time I
had ever seen Dr. Janeway in the sick-room. It would be hard to describe
the difference between this man I now saw examining the sick woman and
the Dr. Janeway I had known before. There was a light in his eyes and an
alertness in his voice, entirely new to me, as he deftly built up his
diagnosis, pointing out this physical sign and that, until the complete
pathological picture seemed to stand out as on the page of a book.

A little later as we came out from a talk with the family, he turned to
them and said: "Now the doctor and I wish to have a little consultation
together." How well I remember my feelings at that moment as he led me
into a room apart and closed the door. Anticipating what seemed to me
inevitable I said: "Of course, Dr. Janeway, they will want someone who
is older, someone with more--" He cut me short with, "You are going to
take care of her." "But--but--" I said. As if reading my thoughts he
smiled as he remarked: "That's what we are going to talk over now. Get a
pencil and paper and we will outline the necessary treatment." I wrote
down what he suggested, we arranged about getting the trained nurses,
and then, somehow, as the Doctor rose to go, the feeling came over me
that after all this was more of a job than, perhaps, I had any right to
undertake alone. I stood for a moment with these thoughts in my mind
when the Doctor put his hand on my shoulder and said: "If things don't
go just right come up any time and see me and we'll have a little talk;
or if you need me here, let me know. I am going now to tell the family
you will take charge of this case."

And thus it was that the old lady was guided back to consciousness and
comfort by the steady head and generous hand in the background; while
the fledgeling physician reaped praise for her progress.




II


It was not until a year or two later that I was again brought, in a
medical way, into association with the Doctor. It happened to be at the
beginning of summer and at a time when I was waiting for a hospital
position in the fall, that I received word from him offering me a
position in his office in New York to take the place of his regular
laboratory assistant who was to be away for several months. No offer
before or since ever sounded so good to me. The morning of the appointed
day saw me there bright and early. This was to be a rare opportunity. I
felt it then; I know it now. Some of the secrets of his greatness were
to be unfolded to me, and I was eager for the work which would teach me
something of his ways.

I was shown to the laboratory which was to be my special province. This
was equipped for carrying out by microscopical and chemical analysis,
all the practical tests which were necessary, as well as some bacterial
breeding. Absolute accuracy of results was the single aim and the simple
motto of this workshop. It was a room built on at the back of the house,
where light and quiet were assured. To the front of this were the
waiting-rooms for the patients, and at the front of the house, the
Doctor's office. Simple and sound and always of the best quality, would
serve as a description of the furnishings; there was a striking
similarity between these and the advice that a patient was sure to
receive.

Several days went by without seeing much of the Doctor beyond saying
"good-morning," but no time went by without feeling that force in the
farther office. It seemed to shape itself into one's work, into one's
results. One was not told to do his best--it would not have been
necessary; somehow, one did it.

One day about noon, word came from the Doctor asking me to lunch with
him upstairs after the morning's work was finished, which was usually
half-past one. We sat down to table together, his family being away for
the summer, and luncheon was served. I waited quietly to hear what the
Doctor wished to speak with me about, but as he said nothing, we ate on
in silence until the end of the meal. When we rose to leave the table,
the Doctor turned to me and in his blunt way said: "Better have your
lunch here every day." As he hurried off to keep an appointment, the
suspicion fell across my mind that perhaps he had surmised that my
pocketbook would be better for this little noonday rest he was
suggesting; but quite apart from that, I was more than glad to have this
extra opportunity of being with him and of learning from him.

For some little time we met daily at lunch without the conversation
getting much above the level of the small civilities incident to eating,
when one day it suddenly came over me that I was not making the best of
my opportunities. But Dr. Janeway was a man of very few words. Through
doing, not talking, had he risen to his reputation--to his results. How
was I to begin? How was I to gain his interest? Surely not by airing
that new and conventional structure of scanty knowledge the medical
school had so recently assisted me in setting up in my mind, its
storerooms so empty of experience, its machinery still rigid for want
of real use. No, I did not mean to burden him by trying to open the
ball of intercourse in that direction. And yet, if somehow we could only
get on some common ground, and I could commence to learn something from
his rich experience; if, somehow, I could get by my diffidence of nature
in the presence of his depth of knowledge!

I do not know how it came about, as he sat there opposite me, so
serious, so silent, but something seemed suddenly to plunge my mind into
a perfectly irrelevant region of thought, and drag therefrom to the
surface some droll tale I had happened to hear only a few days since.
Before I knew it, I was telling the Doctor that story. Fools rush in;
but there is a Providence that cares for them, for the Doctor enjoyed
it--he laughed, and from then on interchange of thought was less
restrained.




III


As time went on, the structural elements of this extraordinary man's
character became more and more evident. He was then at the very apogee
of his useful career. His fame had found its way around the world. The
makings of a material monument were within his easy reach--the thing
which spells supreme success in life for so many men and women, and not
a few physicians, was at his very door had he cared to look in that
direction; yet his face was set steadily forward toward other things. If
his income was ample, his energy was enormous, and he spent both freely
for the best interests of his profession and his people whom he loved.
One hears of the fabulous fees physicians sometimes get. Dr. Janeway
never used his unique position to prey upon the pockets of patients,
simply because they were people of large worldly wealth. To him a
patient was a human being who was sick and who needed to get well by the
shortest possible route science and sense could secure. Each patient
also provided a problem, and it was here where his masterly mind with
its prodigious store of pathological information, derived a singular
satisfaction. Illustrating the Doctor's direction of mind in matters of
money in comparison with his interest in the patient's condition, this
story, which belongs to the period of his beginning prominence, is
significant even if its verity cannot be vouched for.

To one of the smaller Hudson River valley towns the Doctor was called by
a local practitioner to see in consultation a man noted for his wealth,
who lay critically ill. All the afternoon and evening were consumed in
this rather trying trip. When the next morning at breakfast his wife
made some mention of his arduous journey of the previous day, his face
lighted up with interest at the recollection. To a practical wife, what
could be more natural than an interest which embraced with some
satisfaction the thought of her husband's immediate reward--that reward
which could be readily converted into the shoes and frocks constantly
needed by the little brood about her? So led on with the thought in her
mind, she inquired how far the Doctor had travelled--the town to which
he had gone. He told her with readiness the name of the railway station
where the practitioner had met him and driven him to the patient's
house; then his face relighting with the memory of the case which had so
engrossed him, came out in his characteristic way with: "Very sick man;
pneumonia; unusual type--very unusual." "But that very long trip, a
whole afternoon and evening, that should mean a pretty good fee," said
his wife. The Doctor, his mind still occupied with the sick man's
problem, replied: "It was in the upper lobe, right side, quite solid,
very rare--very rare to see that in these cases."

Then very gently from his wife came: "Did you remember to put down his
address?" "No, no," was the somewhat irritable response. His mind then
going back to the patient again: "But I have my notes on the case--on
his condition." "But his name?" she came out with, "so that you can send
your bill; you put that down?" "His name?" repeated the Doctor slowly, a
slight frown of annoyance coming over his face as his train of thought
was by then definitely derailed. "His name? No. Didn't get that."




IV


One morning I happened, for some reason or other, to be in the Doctor's
office. A lady from a near-by town had been consulting him. As she was
about to leave, she said: "Tell me, Dr. Janeway, about Dr. N. in our
town. We have just gone there to live, you know, and we want to be sure
to have the best doctor in case we have to call one in." Dr. Janeway
replied: "You cannot do better than Dr. N. I know him very well. He is a
good doctor. He won't do you any harm." The lady went away and I went
back to my work in the laboratory, but that phrase kept ringing in my
ears. "He is a very good doctor. He won't do you any harm." What had he
meant by that? I kept wondering. Well, the woman seemed to be
satisfied; at least she went away without further comment. Later
on--perhaps two or three weeks later--I heard him make very much the
same remark again: "Dr. R. is an excellent doctor. He won't do you any
harm." I did not understand his meaning then, but the thing got stuck in
my mind, and I remembered it. It was some years, I think, before that
saying, for it would keep coming back to me, commenced to make its real
impression. Then, as time and experience went on, clearer and clearer
became its significance until I have come to see it as an expression of
that wisdom--that deeper wisdom of the man whose simple words often
revealed such subtle truths.




V


Dr. Janeway's relation to his profession and to his fellow physicians
was one of rare felicity, and well it might have been, for his code of
professional conduct stood squarely upon that principle of consideration
for others, on which the hope of a some-time civilization in reality,
must ever rest. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," was
more than his motto; it was his motive; more than his precept, it was
his practice. The revised version: "Do others before they do you," which
has come so largely into recent vogue, both professionally as well as
commercially, would have had little appeal to a man whose real goal lay
so far on beyond personal position and private gain. In no better place
than here, with his simple and straight code of conduct, can I mention
something of Dr. Janeway's religion.

In days when doctors are flying from creeds and more--from faith,
seeking to solace their souls in science alone, this great man's simple
adherence to the teachings of Christ become dramatic proof of his powers
of vision. But it was not the conventional Christ drawing a fashionable
flock to a Sunday morning service to church and a Monday morning service
to self, which gave the angle to this man's uprightness; his religion
was one of action rather than exhibition; he used it to control his own
life rather than to coerce the lives of others.




VI


There is one notably outstanding memory of Dr. Janeway which dates from
those earlier days in his office and which deals with that large class
of people who imagine they are ill--those people whose numbers are
directly proportionate to periods of so-called prosperity, who call
forth innumerable cults of curing, and who are the mainstay of much of
the mummery in medicine.

I shall never forget one day at lunch after Dr. Janeway had been seeing
some of these mentally mortgaged men and women. As he sat down at table
his face wore that expression of perplexity which one at times sees as
the outward sign of that inward sense of the futility of things in
general. I inquired how matters had been going in the office that
morning. His reply, "Neurasthenics!" as it came out with all his
characteristic bluntness, set me to asking questions. What I learned
that day from the Doctor, coupled with later observations of his methods
in dealing with these unfortunates, has never needed unlearning. He saw
in these patients, wholly free from organic disorder, yet a prey to
aches and obsessions, to fears and depressions, the unhappy results of
that conflict in the subconscious self between the natural order of life
and the socially ordered life. He saw it and I am sure sorrowed over it.
Yet he never entered into a compact to treat them for what he knew they
did not have. He never left a stone unturned to prove to himself that
they suffered from no physical fault, and with his positive terseness he
rarely failed to prove that fact to them--freeing them, oftentimes for
good and all, from the fears and symptoms which assailed them, and
giving them in few and frank terms the key to their unconscious
calamity.




VII


All too soon for me passed that period of service in Dr. Janeway's
office, but as good fortune would have it, my future was still to feel
the touch of that fine association.

A year later, when my hospital work as an interne was over, Dr.
Janeway's son, Dr. Theodore Janeway, asked me to make my office in his
house. This arrangement continued for two or three years, when I found
myself going to Europe for a winter's special study. With my return to
New York, the necessity of a larger office brought that one-time closer
affiliation with the Doctor to an end. But the seeds were planted which
were destined to bear for me the fruit of one of those infrequent
friendships, the influence of which still goes on, finding fresh
inspiration from its memory.

I had not been long in my new quarters before I again began to feel the
result of Dr. Janeway's and his son's thoughts of me, for it was from
them that many of my first patients were referred, and it was from this
beginning that the happy relationship with the Doctor was steadily
continued as long as he remained in practice.

There was one remarkable thing about all these patients who came from
Dr. Janeway's office, or to those I was called to see at his suggestion;
one thing in which they seemed to differ from all other patients. They
came full of that faith which his thoughtful study and understanding of
their cases forced them to feel--and full of that faith which the deep
sincerity of his interest in their welfare inspired. It made my part
easy and it helped secure good results for the patients, from whom I
would often harvest a gratitude where he had scattered the seeds, and
reap a reward which was due to his husbandry.

It may be trite, nothing more than a frayed commonplace, perhaps, to say
that the force of good goes on, is never lost--yet the sincere, the
straight, the strong something that went out from this man and entered
into others, certainly continued on, and was not lost.




VIII


Self-contained and self-controlled as Dr. Janeway was, there were some
things which kindled his righteous wrath to a state of militant
activity. And one of these was petty political plotting in the ranks of
his own profession--the profession he loved and believed in as an
institution of sound progress when not soiled by selfish purpose. An
instance of this came to me through a personal experience. It was soon
after my return from study abroad, while I was seeking a suitable
position in a city hospital. This particular place was all but secured
when another post was offered to me by the head of one of the largest
medical institutions in town. With youthful naïveté, I expressed my
appreciation of the offer but explained my reasons for wishing to secure
the appointment I had been seeking. Incensed by the fact that I did not
directly jump at his offer, the noted doctor brought the interview
rapidly to an end, and I departed. Some weeks went by and from the
position which I had been in quest of and from which I should have
received word, I heard nothing. And then, I found out why. The powerful
gentleman, whose offer I had not accepted, had lost no time in going to
the hospital head who had practically arranged to assign me to the
desired position, and telling him it would be a great mistake to give me
the post.

When Dr. Janeway found this out, it was plain that there was still
another side to the Doctor, for his strength to strike out at foul play
showed its sufficient force on that occasion. It is almost needless to
say that the desired appointment was very soon mine.




IX


There were three things I should say the Doctor did not like. One of
these was the newspaper reporter who tried to get "inside" information
when some especially prominent person happened to be a patient of his.
This was not just a simple, single-sided dislike which the Doctor felt,
either. The idea of any physician inviting press publicity was bad
enough, but the idea of any physician telling the public about the
private affairs of a patient was--well--. I happened one day to be with
the Doctor when a reporter approached on such an errand, so I know quite
well how the Doctor felt on this subject, and I am inclined to believe
the reporter must also have carried away some impression of it.

The other two things the Doctor seemed to dislike were writing medical
papers and speaking in public; anything, in short, which might by any
chance give an impression of putting himself forward, was distasteful to
him. As for display of any sort, any external polishing, for the purpose
of appearing prosperous and thus inviting prosperity, would have been to
Dr. Janeway utterly impossible.

As far as personal success and advancement went, I am convinced his mind
was never concerned beyond that measure of reward which might openly be
balanced against actual attainment and actual ability. What a sorrowful
satisfaction that would be for many of us!




X


Now that these few ingredients of Dr. Janeway's greatness, which have
come out of memory to mind, have found their way to paper, it is hoped
they may not wholly miss their mark. Incomplete though the picture is,
it should carry some clue to the character of the man who made the
profession of medicine a finer and a better profession for his having
been in it. To bring into any walk of life so much talent and truth, so
much candour and courage, and withal, such simplicity and sincerity, is
to leave it raised to a higher level for all time.

Such lives need no tribute to their memory. On the contrary, they levy
an unforgettable tax on all who would live on by lower standards.

To those whose minds can grasp the general disorder in which we try to
live--the moral indirection of our everyday endeavour to get somewhere,
this day toward a gilded goal, tomorrow toward the promise of fame, the
day after seeking applause for our benevolence, or one after one thing,
another after another thing, and hardly any one after anything that
counts--it is to these that this man's unaffected, unselfish, upbuilding
life must come as a strong and refreshing draught of reality.

A life worth knowing about for those with ideals; a life to study for
those who are sincere; a life with a lesson for every student of
medicine.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
